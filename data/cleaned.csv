0,children," the next asteroid the little prince came to was inhabited by a quiz addict. he sat hunched in front of his laptop, and barely looked up when the little prince greeted him. there was nowhere else to sit, since the whole asteroid was covered in books. 
 ""good morning!"" said the little prince. 
 ""i'm sorry, i don't have time to talk to you,"" said the quiz addict. ""i am very busy. wait. in twilight, what color was edward's car?"" 
 ""i don't know,"" said the little prince. ""i have never read this book twilight."" 
 ""i think it was blue,"" said the man. ""damn! i was wrong. silver. in twilight, who joined the cullen family first?"" 
 ""i told you,"" said the little prince, ""that i haven't read this book. but it must be an interesting book if you answer questions about it all day long. i would very much like to read it."" 
 ""it is the stupidest book ever written!"" said the man. 
 ""then why do you answer questions about it all day long?"" asked the little prince. 
 ""because if i don't,"" sighed the man, ""then my friend on asteroid b451 will get ahead of me. ""he has read the whole series. luckily, he hasn't read harry potter and the deathly hallows."" 
 ""when you have finished the quiz,"" asked the little prince, ""i hope you will be able to read some of these books you have around you? i notice that you have had atonement on your to-read list for the last six months."" 
 ""it is a never-ending quiz,"" answered the man. ""in twilight, what color was edward's car?"" 
 ""i believe you said silver?"" answered the little prince politely. 
 ""thank you,"" muttered the man. ""yes! you were right. i should have known that."" 
 ""i'm sorry, i must be going,"" said the little prince. and he went on his way, thinking that grown-ups were very, very, very strange. lowry's book is a piece of nationalist propaganda, using oversimplification, emotional appeals, and dualistic morality to shut down her readers' minds. more troubling is that it is aimed at children, who don't yet have the critical faculties to defend themselves from such underhanded methods. 
 unsurprisingly, lowry adopts the structure of the monomyth, equating a spiritual journey with a moral one. her christ-figure uses literal magic powers to rebel against his society. this rebellion and the morality behind it are presented as 'natural', to contrast with the 'abnormal morality' around him. 
 lowry doesn't seem to understand that we get our morality from our culture, it isn't something in-born that we 'lose'. this is the first hint of lowry's misunderstanding of the human mind. she assumes her own morality is correct, and then builds her story to fit it. 
 she also makes the character act and think like a modern person would, despite never adequately explaining how he came up with such unusual notions. it's the same trick many historical fiction authors use, leaving us scratching our heads as to why a fourteenth century french peasant speaks like a second-wave feminist. i'd suggest that lowry falls to this fault for the same reason they do: she has no talent for imagining how others might think differently. 
 lowry's book ends with the standard nonspecific transgressive spiritual event that marks any overblown monomyth. since the book is not a progressive presentation of ideas, it does not suggest any conclusion. instead, the climax is a symbolic faux-death event (symbolic of what, none can say). confusingly, lowry later redacts the ending in the sequels, undermining the pseudo-spiritual journey she created. 
 though some call this book 'dystopian', it's closer to the truth to say lowry borrows elements from the dystopian authors, attempting to combine the spiritual uplift of the monomyth with the political and social deconstruction of the dystopia. what she doesn't recognize is that the faith of the one conflicts with the cynicism of the other. she draws on ideas and images from many other authors: bradbury, huxley, orwell, burgess, but doesn't improve upon them. 
 these authors created novels that reflected the world around them. they based them on the political events of the times, presented with realism and careful psychology. though they presented the struggle between the individual and the society, they portrayed morality as grey, and suffering as the result of individual human faults, not political systems. lowry doesn't realize that the best way to critique fascism or communism is not to present it as 'evil', but to simply present it as it was. 
 but lowry's world is not based in reality, it is symbolic and hyperbolic. instead of writing about how poverty makes the world seem small and dull, she has the characters magically unable to experience life. instead of an impersonal government, she presents a sort of evil hippy commune. 
 the only political system it resembles is a school, which is a neat little trick to get the kids interested. the idea that 'school=unfeeling totalitarian hell' is not an uncommon one, but it's one i'm surprised teachers would support. the book also suggests a creche, but lacking similarity to any real-world system, it doesn't work as a political criticism. 
 lowry creates this artificial world to suit her purposes, but it is not a symbolic exercise like 'animal farm'. we understand that the pigs of animal farm are symbolic, because there are no talking pigs. lowry's world is more insidious, since its oversimplification is hidden. she builds an artificial world to support the dualist morality that she's pushing. she presents the same knee-jerk fears about euthanasia and abortion that people use against women's rights or health care. 
 worse than these straw man arguments is the fact that she never deals with the economic causes of totalitarianism. tyrants don't just rise up and take control by their own force of will, they come into power because of the socioeconomic situations that surround them. lean times produce strong, fascist leaders while profitable times produce permissive, liberal societies. 
 strong, centralized leadership simply doesn't self-propagate in cultures where everyone is clothed, fed, and housed. the holocaust was socially about some ideal of 'change' and 'purity', but it was economically about the transmission of wealth from jews, poles, and catholics to germans (and more specifically, to those germans who had elected the new ruling party). 
 the atrocities of war are, for the most part, committed by normal people on other normal people. by presenting the power structure as 'amoral' and 'inhuman', lowry ignores the fact that people will willingly cause others to suffer. painting the enemy as 'evil' and 'alien' is just an unsophisticated propagandist method. 
 she contrasts her 'evil' with the idealized 'goodness' of emotion, beauty, and freedom. this is nothing more than the american dream of 'specialness' that mr. rogers was pushing for so many years. we are all special, we are all good, we all deserve love and happiness. sure, it sounds good, but what does it mean? 
 where does this 'specialness' come from? if it is just the 'sanctity of human life', then it's not really special, because it's all-encompassing. if all of us are special, then none of us are. there's nothing wrong with valuing life, but when lowry presents one mode of life as valuable and another as reprehensible, she ceases to actually value humanity as a whole. instead, she values a small, idealized chunk of humanity. 'people are good, except the ones i don't like' is not a moral basis, nor is it a good message to send to kids. 
 if the specialness is only based on fitting in with a certain moral and social guideline, then lowry isn't praising individuality, she's praising herd behavior. the protagonist is only 'special' because he has magic powers. his specialness is not a part of his character, it is an emotional appeal. 
 the idea of being a special individual is another piece of propaganda, and its one kids are especially prone to, because kids aren't special: they are carefully controlled and powerless. giving a character special powers and abilities and then using that character to feed a party line to children is not merely disingenuous, it's disturbing. 
 there is also a darker side to universal specialness: giving a child a sense of importance without anything to back it up creates egotism and instability. adults noticed that children with skills and friends had high self-esteems, but instead of teaching their children social skills and knowledge, they misunderstood the causal relationship and tried to give them self-worth first. 
 unfortunately, the moment unsupported self-worth is challenged, the child finds they have nothing to fall back on. their entitlement didn't come from their skills or experiences, and so they have nothing to bolster that sense of worth. instead, any doubt sends them down a spiral of emotional instability. 
 a single book like this wouldn't be the cause of such a state in a child, but it does act as part of the social structure built to give a sense of worth without a solid base for that worth. people like to believe they are special, kids especially so, but being a remarkable person is not a result of belief but of actions. if the book had informed them, then it would leave them better off, but giving them a conclusion based on emotional appeals does nothing to build confidence or character. 
 many people have told me this book is good because it appeals to children, but children often fall for propaganda. children develop deep relationships with pop stars, breakfast cereals, and japanese monsters. this does not make them good role models for children. 
 feeding 'specialness' to kids along with a political message is no better than the fascist youth programs lowry intends to criticize. the obsession with individuality is just another form of elitism. it's ironic that people in america most often describe themselves as individuals when pointing out the things they do to align themselves with groups. 
 but banding together in a community is not a bad thing. for lowry and other 'red scare' children, any mention of 'communal' can turn into a witch hunt, but we all give up some personal rights and some individuality in order to live in relatively safe, structured societies. there are benefits to governmental social controls and there are drawbacks, and it's up to us to walk the line between the two. anarchy and totalitarianism never actually exist for long: we are social animals. 
 it's not difficult to understand why lowry is so popular, especially amongst educators. the message she gives aligns perfectly with what they were taught as kids, from red scare reactionism to the hippy-dippy 'unique snowflake' mantra. these ideas aren't entirely misguided, either. it's good to recognize the benefits of difference and the dangers of allowing other to control our lives. 
 if a reader believes that fascism and socialism are inherently wrong and that their own individuality is their greatest asset, they will likely sympathize with lowry's work. however, this doesn't make the book honest, nor beneficial. one of the hardest things we can do as readers is disagree with the methods of authors we agree with ideologically. 
 it makes us feel good to find authors who agree with us, but this is when we should be at our most skeptical. searching the world for self-justification is not a worthwhile goal, it simply turns you into another short-sighted, argumentative know-it-all. 'yes men' never progress. 
 lowry is toeing the party line. she does not base her book around difficult questions, like the dystopian authors, but around easy answers. she doesn't force the reader to decide for themselves what is best, she makes it clear what she wants us to think. her book is didactic, which means that it instructs the reader what to believe. 
 even if her conclusions about individuality vs. community are correct, she doesn't present arguments, she only presents conclusions. like rote memorization or indoctrination, she teaches nothing about the politics, social order, economics, or psychology of totalitarianism or individuality. the reader is not left with an understanding, just an opinion. 
 the baseless 'individuality' of the book lets the reader imagine that they are rebels--that they are bucking the system even as they fall into lock-step. by letting the reader think they are already free-thinking, lowry tricks them into forgetting their skepticism. 
 she is happy to paint a simple world of black and white, and this is likely the world she sees. i doubt she is purposefully creating an insidious text, she just can't see past her own opinions. she writes this book with a point to make, and makes it using emotional appeals and symbolism. she doesn't back it up with arguments because she doesn't seem to have developed her opinions from cogent arguments. 
 in the end, she doesn't show us that the structure of this society is wrong, she says nothing poignant about individuality vs. community; instead, she relies on threats to the life of an innocent infant. yet nowhere does she provide an argument for why communal living or the sacrifice of freedoms for safety must necessarily lead to infanticide. 
 in politics, making extreme claims about the opposing side is called mud-slinging, it is an underhanded and dishonest tactic. it works. arguing intelligently is difficult, accusing is easy, so that's what lowry does. 
 she is another child of wwii and the cold war who hasn't learned her lesson. she quickly condemns the flaws of others while failing to search out her own. even after the holocaust, there are many racist, nationalist, violent jews; conflict rarely breeds a new understanding. 
 america condemned the faceless communal life of the second world, and yet america created the projects. we critiqued strong governmental controls, but we still have the bank bailout, socialized medicine, socialized schooling, and socialized charity. america condemned the gulags and work camps, and yet we imprison one out of every hundred citizens; far more than stalin ever did. some are killed, all are dehumanized. 
 as a little sci fi adventure, the book isn't terrible. it's really the pretension that goes along with it. lowry cobbles together religious symbolism and dystopic tropes and then tries to present it as something as complex and thoughtful as the authors she copied. copying isn't a crime, but copying poorly is. 
 like dan brown or michael crichton, she creates a political pamphlet of her own ideals, slaps a pretense of authority on it, and then waits for the money and awards to roll in--and they did. many people i've discussed this book with have pointed to those awards as the surest sign of this book's eminent worth. 
 award committees are bureaucratic organizations. their decisions are based on political machinations. this book is a little piece of nationalism, and so it was lauded by the political machine that lowry supports. the left hand helps the right. if awards are the surest sign of worth, then titanic is a better movie than citizen kane. 
 what surprises me is how many of those who brought up the award as their argument were teachers. if a politically-charged administrative committee is the best way to teach children, then why do you take umbrage when the principal tells you that bigger class sizes (and fewer benefits) are fine? listen to him: doesn't he have award plaques? 
 the other argument is usually that 'kids like it'. i usually respond that kids also like candy, so why not teach that? some people also get angry at me for analyzing a book written for children: 
 ""of course it's not a great book, it's for kids! if you want a good book, go read ulysses!"" 
 i prefer to give children good books rather than pieces of political propaganda (even if they agreed with me). children can be as skeptical, quick-witted, and thoughtful as adults if you give them the chance, so i see no excuse for feeding them anything less. 
 kids aren't stupid, they just lack knowledge, and that's a fine distinction. it's easy for adults to take advantage of their naivete, their emotionality, and their sense of worth. just because it's easier for the teacher doesn't mean it's better for the child. 
 when we show children something that is over-simplified, presenting an idealized, crudely moralizing world, we aren't preparing them for the actual world. if you give a child a meaningless answer to repeat, he will repeat it, but he won't understand why. 
 why not give the child a book that presents many complex ideas, but no rote answers, and let them make up their own minds? if they don't learn how to separate the wheat from the chaff and form their own opinions early, in a safe, nurturing environment, what chance will they have on their own as adults? 
 in all the discussions and research regarding this book, i have come across very little analysis. it's especially surprising for a book with such a strong following, but there aren't many explanations of why the book is supposed to be useful or important. 
 this lack of argument makes sense from a political standpoint, since there is no reason to analyze the worth of propaganda: its worth is that it agrees with society and indoctrinates readers. analyzing it would defeat the purpose; political diatribes do not stand up to thoughtful attention. 
 perhaps someday someone will create a thoughtful, textual analysis of this book that will point out its merits, its structure and its complexity. i've gradually come to doubt it. i never expected when i wrote my original review of this book that it would garner this much attention. 
 i still welcome comments and thoughts, but if your comment looks roughly like this: 
 ""you should read this book again, but this time, like it more. you think you're smart but you aren't. you're mean. lowry is great. this book won awards and kids like it. it's meant for kids anyways, why would you analyze what its about? i bet you never even read the sequels. go read 'moby dick' because you are full of yourself."" 
 i've heard that one before. if you do want to comment though, you might check out this article; i find it helps me with presenting my ideas. ""good gracious!"" said alice, ""i do believe i'm inside a review!"" 
 she turned to the hatter and the march hare. 
 ""well, let me see. here is the title, and here is the date i read it. that must be today. now i need to explain the plot and the overall point."" 
 ""there is no plot,"" said the march hare disagreeably. 
 ""and there is no point,"" agreed the hatter. 
 he poured a little hot tea on the dormouse's nose, making it wake with a start. 
 ""the book breaks new ground,"" it said rapidly in a high, sing-song voice. ""intentionally eluding easy assignment to any traditional category, it anticipates the twentieth century's fascination with the relationship between the signifier and the signified, and wittily deconstructs the primacy of meaning and the rationality of thought."" then it went back to sleep again, and began to snore gently. 
 ""whatever did that mean?"" asked alice, surprised. 
 ""why is a derrida like a derriere?"" replied the hatter. 
 ""i don't know,"" said alice. 
 ""i don't know either,"" said the hatter triumphantly. 
 ""it would be reasonable"", said alice, in the grown-up tone she had sometimes heard her sister use, ""it would be reasonable for you to explain what the book is about, so that i could put that in my review."" 
 ""it would be reasonable,"" said the hatter, ""to expect hot premarital sex in a stephenie meyer novel. but don't imagine you'll find any."" 
 alice couldn't think of anything to reply to this, so she turned away without another word. when she was almost out of earshot, she thought she heard the hatter shout something after her that might have been ""foucault!"" i recently read this book to my little boy. 
 it's not the first time i've read it. it's probably not even the tenth time. but it's the first time i've read the book in a decade, and given the fact that my memory is like a cheese grater, i like to think i got a pretty fresh experience. 
 the result is this: i honestly don't know how i feel about this book. 
 even if you haven't read the story, you probably know the gist of it. a tree loves a young boy and gives away pieces of itself to the boy to make the boy happy. 
 on one hand, this story can be taken as an open, honest exhortation toward selfless agape-style love. love which asks nothing. love which gives everything. 
 on the other hand, this story can be read as a horrifying condemnation of dysfunctional unrequited co-dependance. 
 after reading the book, i honestly don't know which it is. 
 on one hand, taking this book at face value is probably a fool's game. silverstein was a twisted sarcastic bastard. he wrote lyrics for dr. hook. (most notably ""freaking at the freaker's ball."") and back in my misspent youth, i discovered a poem of his in one of my dad's playboys. it was called ""the great pot smoke-off."" 
 my point is, dude was part of the counterculture. he was full of mocking and meta. and as such, it seems odd that he would write something that seems like an obvious endorsement of christ-like selflessness... and then that was it. 
 but on the other hand, when silverstein was having fun with you, he usually didn't pussyfoot around. one of his earliest publications was ""uncle shelby's abz book."" which *looks* like a kid's book, but is clearly not: 
 here's a piece from the page on potty training: 
 ""see the potty 
 the potty is deep 
 the potty has water in the bottom. 
 ""maybe someone will fall into the potty and drown. 
 ""don't worry. as long as you keep wetting your pants, you will never drown in the potty."" 
 not a lot of ambiguity here. his tongue is pretty clearly in his cheek. 
 but when i read through the giving tree, i don't see the author winking at me from behind the scenes. the story *seems* to be straightforward. 
 but here's the thing, even if the story *is* straightforward, i don't know how i feel about it. is the boy selfish in the story? absolutely. he's a little shit. yet he doesn't get one bit of comeuppance. we kinda want him to, but that's not what happens. the boy doesn't seem to learn a lesson. and neither does the tree. 
 that seems to imply there is no lesson to be learned here. 
 let's be clear. the tree is *happy* at the end of the book. there's no ambiguity about that. it's entirely possible that the tree has acted in its own best interest. it's entirely possible that the tree, if you'll forgive the expression, is acting according to the lethani. 
 even after thinking it over for a couple days, still i don't know how i feel about it. that's a rarity for me. 
 for that reason, i'm giving this five stars. if you write a book that leaves me asking questions. if you write a book that people can have legitimate disagreements about. if you write a book that people can still wrangle over after fifty years... that's pretty clearly a five-star book. there are two kinds of people in the world. those who like green eggs and ham, and those who don't. 
 well, three. those who like green eggs and ham. those who don't. and those who like the green eggs but not the ham. it's just ham, not green ham. we should get that straight. oh, correction, it's green ham too. 
 anyhow four kinds of people. the haters, the likers, the green egg but not green hammers, and the green hammers but not green eggs. 
 actually i guess there are the people who would eat them with a fox, but not in a box. and some who would eat them with a fox, in a box, on a train, but not with a goat. 
 ok. so there are lots of kinds of people in the world. dr seuss invents diversity. kudos. 
 really the book is about the key existential question in the 20th and 21st centuries. green food, yes or no, and under what conditions. it's a metaphor for where a man ... or woman ... or thing called sam ... draws the line. 
 where people, where will you draw that line? 
 green eggs and (green) ham is a cipher for our age, an antithesis to the jejune, a whirlwind of growing complexity into which we pour our souls and come face to face with the naked question - will we try them? try them and we may, i say. 
 seuss offers us a black and white and green question - do we like them? but this devolves into shades of grey (green), we're crippled with choice, seduced by the rhythm, shocked by the goat. 
 in the end, my friends, there are only two kinds of people. those who push the 'like' button on my review of green eggs and ham, and those who suck.

 what a wonderful first book of the year! i read this book almost too quickly, i wanted it to last longer. this might be technically a children's book, but it really was such a special and meaningful read and i highly recommend that everyone read this once in their lives! i know that many people have a sentimental love for this book, and i respect that -- you can't rationalize emotional connection. and generally, i like this author. but with this book, since it inspired no real emotional response in me, i am left with only the rational perspective, which in me was this: 
 this book troubles me deeply, because it enshrines self-destructive and self-pitying martyrdom as the paragon of love for others. and i think there is already far too much of this in our society. this book seems to say that if you really love someone else, you will damage yourself, cripple yourself, tear down your boundaries, destroy yourself for them. and further, it implies that those who are loved must by nature use and devour those who love them. an incredibly unhealthy model for love and relationships, especially for a child's book. 
 i am a parent of two, and though many parents have offered up this book as representative of the true nature of parental love, i cannot agree. if i were to raise my children this way, i feel i would only be teaching them to take selfishly from those who love them, to use people up and always expect more -- and on the flip side, i would be teaching them that if they love someone then they have to give of themselves until it hurts, have to live without boundaries of any kind. 
 instead of raising my kids this way, i feel it's important to teach them to respect those who love them and care for them, to not take from others so much that it damages; i feel it's important to teach them that even in love we all must maintain our boundaries, our integrity. i feel it's important that my kids, and all kids really, understand that real, healthy love does not demand destruction or diminishment of anyone involved in it, that in fact real and healthy love ultimately heals and builds up those who participate in it. 
 i suppose that this book may have been intended as an anti-lesson, an example of how not to behave -- but if so, then it was not made clear that this was the case, because most people who read this book seem to take it as an ideal example of love. 
 certainly it's possible to not take it so seriously; but when the underlying message and philosophy is so concentrated and heavy-handed, it's hard to avoid tasting it in every passage. 
 it reminds me of that other beloved childhood book about love, where the young boy's mother is so obsessive about cuddling him and tucking him in at night that even as he gets older and older, she follows him around, sneaks into his college dorm, sneaks into his home as an adult, takes him from his bed with his wife still sleeping and reassures him (herself?) that he'll ""always be my baby"". *shudder* 
 overall: sweet, but to the point of being cloying, and a disturbing message. =/ tonight i just finished reading charlie and the chocolate factory with my son. this is the first chapter book i've read all the way through with him. and it was a ton of fun. 
 first off, i'll admit that i love the movie. i grew up with it. (i'm talking about the gene wilder version, of course.)i'll even admit to liking the movie better than the book. which is something that doesn't happen very often with me. 
 that said, the book is really, really good. it held my four-year old's attention. it's silly, and it's fun. 
 and it's dark. 
 for those of you who haven't read the book, let me underline this fact for you. dahl takes pains to really detail the fact that charlie and his family aren't just hungry and poor. they're destitute. charlie sleeps on a mattress on the floor. in the winter they are cold, and they're starving to death. 
 and if you think i'm exaggerating on that last point, i'm not. one of the chapters is titled: the family begins to starve. 
 but you know what? i like this book better because of that. it's not sanitized pablum written by committee to be inoffensive. it's the story of a little boy who is in a fucking awful situation, but he is still good and kind and polite and then something really nice happens to him. 
 that's a trope i can get behind. 
 its it a good book to read with your kids? absolutely. 
 that said, allow me to tangent off and share my thoughts as a total bastard: 
 if willie wonka actually hired workers and paid them a living wage, maybe charlie bucket wouldn't be starving to death in the first place. 
 follow me here. wonka is effectively running a company where everyone is paid in scrip. the oompa loompas are paid, quite literally, in beans. beans that i'm guessing he has the oompa loompas themselves growing in some huge underground cavern. 
 let's not even get into the ethical tarpit of the fact that wonka uproots an entire indigenous culture and enslaves them. let's just look at this from a raw numbers point of view. pure economics. 
 the oompa loompas work in the factory. they are not paid. they never leave the factory. that means they don't pay rent. they don't buy groceries. they don't go to the movies, or take taxis ,or buy clothes. 
 but *everyone* buys wonka's chocolate. 
 that means that money goes into the factory, but it doesn't come back out into the town. 
 as a result, the local economy is crap. and it's because of this that charlie's dad can't get a decent job. what's more, it's because of this that his dad *loses* his shitty job, and his family is starving to death. 
 willie wonka isn't a childlike magic maker. he's a billionaire corporate fuckwit. he's the candy equivalent of monsanto. there's no government oversight there. osha would never have approved that bullshit boiled sweet boat and chocolate river. no. dude is untouchable. 
 and don't tell me he isn't. that shit that goes on with the other kids? nobody even *thinks* of suing him. none of the parents even *hint* at it. he probably owns half the judges in the state, and a handful of senators, too. 
 he's a fucking supervillian. and i would paid serious money to see a story where batman kicks his ass. 
 *end rant* 
 in closing, let me share something that oot said while i was reading him this book: 
 ""dad, willie wonka is just a regular human, but he *is* a little bit of a wizard like you."" flying through this series--and the netflix show! (read a book, watch two episodes, repeat) 
 these books are clever and dark and fun and i'm still really wishing i'd read them as kid! again, i am enjoying them, but i know i would've loved them much more if i were within the target age range here. 
 with this specific installment, i was way less frustrated with the word-defining aspect, but i'm starting to lose patience with mr. poe. i really like that the adult characters like poe and aunt josephine are flawed, i think it's important for kids to know that adults aren't automatically right, they can be selfish and scared and make bad decisions. but come on poe. he seems to be shifting from well-intentioned but kinda dumb to this patronizing antagonistic character and i'm not sure how i feel about that, but we shall see. 
 also, one last thing that i want to briefly note -- a lot of the language describing/referring to the person ""that looks neither like a man nor woman"" had me cringing, and the villainizing of gender ambiguity could be very hurtful to some readers. i realize this book came out like 17 years ago, but still, just wanted to comment on that. i think that the failure not only of children's literature as a whole, but of our very concept of children and the child's mind is that we think it a crime to challenge and confront that mind. children are first protected from their culture--kept remote and safe--and then they are thrust incongruously into a world that they have been told is unsafe and unsavory; and we expected them not to blanch. 
 it has been my policy that the best literature for children is not a trifling thing, not a simplification of the adult or a sillier take on the world. good children's literature is some of the most difficult literature to write because one must challenge, engage, please, and awe a mind without resorting to archetypes or life experience. 
 once a body grows old enough, we are all saddened by the thought of a breakup. we have a set of knowledge and memories. the pain returns to the surface. children are not born with these understandings, so to make them understand pain, fear, and loss is no trivial thing. the education of children is the transformation of an erratic and hedonistic little beast into a creature with a rational method by which to judge the world. 
 a child must be taught not to fear monsters but to fear instead electrical outlets, pink slips, poor people, and lack of social acceptance. the former is frightening in and of itself, the latter for complex, internal reasons. i think the real reason that culture often fears sexuality and violence in children is because they are such natural urges. we fear to trigger them because we cannot control the little beasts. we cannot watch them every minute. 
 so, to write children's literature, an author must create something complex and challenging, something that the child can turn over in their mind without accidentally revealing some terrible aspect of the world that the child is not yet capable of dealing with. carroll did this by basing his fantasies off of complex, impersonal structures: linguistics and mathematical theory. these things have all the ambiguity, uncertainty, and structure of the grown-up world without the messy, human parts. 
 this is also why the alice stories fulfill another requirement i have for children's lit: that it be just as intriguing and rewarding for adults. there is no need to limit the depth in books for children, because each reader will come away with whatever they are capable of finding. fill an attic with treasures and the child who enters it may find any number of things--put a single coin in a room and you ensure that the child will find it, but nothing more. 
 of course, we must remember that nothing we can write will ever be more strange or disturbing to a child than the pure, unadulterated world that we will always have failed to prepare them for. however, perhaps we can fail a little less and give them alice. not all outlets are to be feared, despite what your parents taught you. in fact, some should be prodded with regularity, and if you dare, not a little joy. i'm beginning to wonder if there will ever be a defence against the dark arts teacher who is just a teacher. it feels odd to mark this book as anything less than five stars. it was a huge part of my childhood. 
 what's more, this book is part of the reason i'm a decent public speaker these days. i joined forensics because this was the book that was being used for extemporaneous reading. (i didn't even know what forensics was when i started, just that i liked the book.) 
 and there are things i like here. good things. it's a fun adventure story. there are cool settings. action. tension. the different nature of the islands is cool. there's mystery. magic. wonder. the character of reepicheep alone boosts this book by a full star. 
 the character of eustace is better than i remember him being, too. it's nice to see a kid who is a total dick learn that there's consequences to his actions, then have a redemption arc in a kid's book. 
 but reading this book to my little boy made me confront a lot of the problems in the book. there are slavers in the early chapters, which is something i didn't remember. and a topic i wasn't sure i wanted to introduce to my kid at the age of 6. 
 there's a fair chunk of sexism too. little things scattered throughout the books. not terrible considering when it was written. but still nothing i want soaking into my kid's psyche. the best example of this is ramandu's daughter. caspian meets her, and it becomes obvious that they're going to get married. 
 let's just pass lightly over the fact that she's effectively being treated like a prize for him completing his quest and jump right into the fact that she doesn't have a name! she's referred to as ""ramandu's daughter"" through the entire book despite the fact that she has a larger part in the book. 
 that's fucked up, y'all. 
 there's narrative issues too. the children rarely solve their own problems. several times they're confronted by bad situations or make bad choices but then instead of having to deal with the consequences or figure out solutions, aslan shows up and is all tth_tth. then, under the weight of his disappointed dad eyes and they're filled with shame and realize they should stop being dicks. that's not good storytelling. that's some deus ex leo bullshit. 
 it's a good book, and i'm fond of it. but it's not perfect, and its flaws are large enough that they bear some serious consideration before you put it in front of your kids. these are fast reads, and i'm really invested in the overarching story, but i know i would've liked these so much more as a kid! as an adult they're enjoyable--they're darker than expected, and there's enough cleverness throughout to keep me engaged. but i'm finding myself frustrated with some aspects, like the communication failures between the kids and the adults, and the constant defining of words, which is sometimes really fun, but at other times just feels patronizing. 
 overall, though, i am enjoying these, i'm definitely hooked into the story, and i already care way too much about the fate of the orphans, so i will continue reading my way through this series! *reread july 2017* 
 reread this for booktube-a-thon 2017 just because i was falling behind. obviously i loved it (again). 
 *reread january 2016* 
 read for the school this time and i read the puffin in bloom edition. i loved the new illustrations! his parents did well naming him shel. 
 he never did care to conform. 
 what would compel a guy to rebel 
 if everyone knew him as norm? i don't give a fig if it is a kid's book, charlotte's web is one of the most well-crafted stories ever written. this classic children's tale deserves 5 stars for story craft and language usage alone! (read your strunk & white to understand this man's talents in that regard.) the fact that it's a heart-warmer/wrencher clinches it. never was i made to love pigs and spiders so much in my life. charlotte's web will always rank high amongst my favorites. but why, for the love of god, did they make us watch the cartoon version of this tear-jerker in school? did they want to make us weep embarrassingly in front of one another? if so, mission accomplished, you sadistic school district! shark week starts today!! prepare for shark floats rarrrrrrrrr!! 
 january project = complete! 
 feverish jaws-applause!! 
 this is my january review-project, so it's gonna resurface throughout the month as i work my way through the book 
 okay, so this is what has happened so far!! 
 first of all, i am using my shark pencils to draw sharks, because i'm told that is how famous artists do it. 
 then i enlisted the help of sean of the house because he is good at drawing and i have never used a drawing book before (because i am a natural!) and even though there were instructions at the beginning of the book (that suggest you begin by tracing the examples), i was confused by ""why do i have to draw lines i'm just gonna erase and why do i have to jam a bunch of shapes together instead of just drawing a shape like a shark??"" 
 and sean was all ""plumb lines"" and ""negative space"" and goya quotes and i'm like mmmm, frijoles!! because like a shark i am impatient and bad at listening and hungry and needing to be on the move gnash gnash gnash. 
 so finally i just said drawing time now and i drew a really chubby shark. 
 great white shark 
 and then i drew a somewhat better shark. 
 and now it is time for shark number two!! 
 great white shark 
 i'm not sure i even like the way sharks look in this book - they seem to have too many extraneous lines. why so many chins, shark? but whatever, i drew it anyway: 
 and then i colored it in all fancy: 
 i have decided to do just one ""take"" for all these sharks. i figure if i can't get it right on the first attempt, i don't deserve to be a shark sketch artist. and from here on out, i'm not gonna give away any more farms. i'll post the book's finished sharks, but not the steps on how to get there. that way, you can judge my ability to follow directions, but still hafta buy the book yourself to show off how much better than me you are. at things. 
 hammerhead shark 
 can you even tell which is mine and which is from the book?? hint - i am a girl!! 
 mako shark 
 my mako shark is not the sharpest fin in the ocean, but he means well. derrrrrr... 
 whale shark 
 i don't understand the mouth, i just draw it... 
 basking shark 
 let's hope a basking shark never commits a crime, because it would totally get away with it if the shark police were relying on my drawings to apprehend the culprit. 
 nurse shark 
 my nurse shark is also a vampire! and a civil war enthusiast. 
 thresher shark 
 this shark is angry about the state of that modesty-fin by his genitals. ""what have you done to me, karen??"" he wails. 
 tiger shark 
 i've been taking some liberties with color. it wasn't until after i'd finished this one that i realized i'd been channelling he-man's cat cringer: 
 zebra shark 
 a pox on thee, zebra shark!! 
 blue shark 
 the blue shark is a terrible snob. 
 crested bullhead shark 
 thank god there are other fish in the sea. because this fish sucks. 
 bull shark 
 i don't think i am going to be able to fit all these sharks in the review space!! so many more to come! 
 frilled shark 
 a regrettable frankenshark. can't win 'em all... 
 goblin shark 
 okay, this is the weirdest shark in the book. true, the goblin shark is already crazy-looking: 
 but this drawing looks more like riff raff than a goblin shark. 
 and i am now pleased to respond to a special request and present the goblin king shark: 
 which i am further pleased to note, fortuitously replicates the goblin king bulge. 
 saw shark 
 saw shark smash!! 
 wobbegong (carpet) shark 
 wobbegonggg!!! 
 leopard shark 
 so many triangles! 
 megamouth shark 
 i feel a certain kinship to this one. we are bellowing buddies. 
 prickly dogfish shark 
 this shark lives in fear of being flushed down the toilet when he dies. 
 bamboo shark 
 now there's your tim burton shark, erma! and there's my chubby version of it. my sharks have always just come from a very satisfying meal. 
 sawback angel shark 
 this one required me to draw a square!! no one said there would be squares!!! 
 cookiecutter shark 
 the cookiecutter shark wears lipstick to draw attention away from her freakish external vagina. 
 blacktip reef shark 
 looks like some little shark got his fingies into the jam pot! 
 sand tiger shark 
 poor sand tiger shark has clearly been dropped on the floor and glued back together all wrong. 
 copper shark 
 am i just being shark-racist or are all these sharks starting to look the same? 
 velvet belly lantern shark 
 what is it with this guy and shark crotch-bulge? 
 porbeagle shark 
 phew - photobucket is back up again! (knock wood) was that worth waiting for? i feel like maybe it wasn't. i'm supposed to be getting better at this, not worse! maybe photobucket was doing me a favor being down all day... 
 spinner shark 
 wheeee!! the dance of the penultimate shark!! tomorrow's the last day, guys!! snif. 
 australian ghost shark 
 oh no, a ghost shark!! with - yes - a weird bulge going on back there. the perfect finale to my journey. 
 so, that's the end of the january project, folks!! i have drawn all the sharks there are in the world! feel free to praise/mock/rank my sharks or get them tattooed on your body. 
 just not on your bulge. 
 my very own ocean 
 of course, before i was able to photograph this colorful school of sharks, the most apex predator of them all wandered into frame 
 made herself comfortable 
 and ate a few sharks. r.i.p., bull shark!! 
 see you in february! 
 ************************** 
 thank you, netgalley!! now i am going to be able to draw all kinds of sharks! 
 this is how i draw sharks now, before reading the book:

 happy birthday, greg!!! ah such fun! i don't think i'll read the rest of the series but i did really enjoy this. the little black fish, samad behrangi 
 samad behrangi (june 24, 1939 - august 31, 1967) was an iranian teacher, social critic, folklorist, translator, and short story writer. he is famous for his children's books, particularly the little black fish.

 . shrbyny i know this is a classic and all, but i had a hard time making it through this book. it's full of needless repetition, which makes it longer than it needs to be. what's more, the plot is a mess, leaping from event to event almost randomly at times. 
 i respect what the author is attempting to do here, thematically. eastman is asking bold questions about how things are related to one another. are we a green dog or a yellow one? is it day or night? these are big questions, and they need to be asked. 
 that said, you can have a book that contains big ideas and an interesting story too. and, unfortunately, the story is severely lacking here. 
 the one saving grace of the book was the ""do you like my hat?"" subplot, which was very tight in its execution and satisfying in its resolution. 
 ultimately, when reading a book like this, the question you have to ask yourself is ""would i buy the sequel?"" and i have to say, with some regret, that i wouldn't. there were just too many structural problems with the story for that. 
 * * * 
 seriously though, i had a great time reading this book with my little boy. lots of basic words used in different situations make it a great tool. if i was still teaching esl students, i would use this to clue in struggling students about prepositions. (if you think prepositions are easy, it's only because you're a native speaker. try explaining to someone from japan why you get *in* a car but *on* a train.) 
 as a bonus, this book is long. most kids books seem to be about 20 pages these days, but this is pretty easily triple that. it makes it less of a mind-numbing experience when you end up reading it a couple times. 
 p.s. i meant what i said about the hat subplot. genius. a young boy is awakened from his christmas eve rest by a train that magically appears just outside his home. ignoring the demands of stranger-danger, the boy climbs aboard, finding the car filled with other youngsters. they are treated to goodies while en route to the north pole where santa is to offer the first gift of christmas to one of the passengers in a town-square ceremony attended by all the elves as well as the transported youngsters. our hero is selected, and when asked what he would like, opts for a single bell from santa's sleigh. 
 i knew that i could have any gift i could imagine. but the thing i wanted most for christmas was not inside santa's giant bag. what i wanted more than anything was one silver bell from santa's sleigh. when i asked, santa smiled. then he gave me a hug and told an elf to cut a bell from a reindeer's harness. the elf tossed it up to santa. he stood, holding the bell high above him, and called out, ""the first gift of christmas!"" 
 this is one of the all time great magical stories, with stunning illustrations. i read this to my kids every year on christmas eve since the late 1980s. while they have long outgrown that tradition, on the odd occasions when i pick it up again, it never fails to bring tears to my eyes. the illustrations are incredible and the message of youthful hope symbolized by the bell resonates. 
 when they char my final remains, this is one of the books i want to go into the ashes with me. a review by my 9 y-o son, described by the utterly lovely neil gaiman as the 'best review ever': 
 today i was sick. my mum doesnaeur(tm)t always believe me when i say iaeur(tm)m sick, but my sister was sick yesterday so mum said i could stay off school. aeur~but,aeur(tm) she said, aeur~donaeur(tm)t think youaeur(tm)re going to be lazing around watching tv and playing on the computer all day.aeur(tm) 
 that was bad news. that is, indeed, what i was planning on doing. :( 
 i was bored, so mum let me borrow her kindle to read a book that was making her laugh, called, aeur~fortunately, the milkaeur|aeur(tm) by neil gaiman with illustrations by chris riddell. i noticed that it had brilliant pictures in it aeur"" even on the kindle! aeur"" and mum said i could go on the ipad if i wanted to draw a front cover for the book. i did. lookaeur| 
 (you can see the images at: http://book-walrus.com/book-review-fo...) 
 there was something very good about this book. it was an aeur~enhanced editionaeur(tm) which means that the writer reads the book out loud to you while you read it! this writer is a good reader and he didnaeur(tm)t sound at all like the dalek voice that normally comes out of the kindle. mum said i could stay on the ipad if i wanted to draw a picture of the writer reading the book. but i canaeur(tm)t draw good faces so i drew a picture of the kindle talking. then i labeled it aeur~kindleaeur(tm) because mum asked what it was. 
 (you can see the images at: http://book-walrus.com/book-review-fo...) 
 i started to read. this is me reading. and no. my face is not the book. 
 (you can see the images at: http://book-walrus.com/book-review-fo...) 
 everyone should read this book. it will make everybody laugh. it is good and very clever. the best thing is that it goes backwards and forwards in time with the dad meeting himself all over the place in the past and in the future and in crazy wormholes. 
 (you can see the images at: http://book-walrus.com/book-review-fo...) 
 it has good characters. the dad is a funny dad. i also like the brother and sister because they are not stupid. they ask the dad clever questions to try and trap him, but he is good at wiggling out of trouble. 
 i think this is a very good book and it deserves 5 stars, which i have drawn here (because it meant i could stay on the ipad for longer. :) ) 
 (you can see the images at: http://book-walrus.com/book-review-fo... 
 one day i would like to write books as good as aeur~fortunately, the milkaeur|aeur(tm) and draw pictures as good as this too. 4.5* 
 this was so much fun! such a quick and engaging read. i loved how all the fairy tales i know and love were incorporated into the story. i actually listened to the audiobook, which is read by chris colfer, and it really enhanced my reading experience. 
 i will admit, i found the writing at times to be a tad lackluster, but that was mostly a problem with showing vs. telling that i think can be attributed to the fact that it's a middle grade novel. i think this is a series i will definitely be continuing! today my son caught my eye, then pointed conspiratorially to his sweat pants. then he pointed to his shirt. 
 it took me a moment to realize that he was wearing all his clothes inside out. because that's one of the ways you keep yourself safe from faerie magic. 
 so yeah. it think it's safe to say that these books have had an impact on him. lol, 1st book for the booktube-a-thon complete! 2nd book complete still five stars. love this so much. can't review. couldn't even take notes. watched the movie immediately after finishing. need next book. wish i lived in this world. damn you, rowling. ** spoiler alert ** 
 if there are no wrong answers, can we really say that something has any meaning? 
 it is very easy to start an interesting science fiction story. simply begin with a mystery. don't explain things to the reader and leave them in a state of wonder. in this way, everything will seem interesting, intriguing, and worth exploring. tap into the reader's powers of imagination and allow them to make your story interesting in ways you need not imagine, and perhaps cannot create. this is a good plan for starting a science fiction story. lots of science fiction stories begin in this way. on television, almost all of them do - 'x-files', 'lost', 'battlestar galactica', 'the 4400', 'the truth is out there.' 'they have a plan.' 
 'the giver' starts in this way. in the first few pages as the setting unfolded, i was struck by the parallels to china after the cultural revolution - the bicycles, the uniform-like clothing, the regulated life, the shame based culture, and 'the sameness'. i also thought of china, because i immediately grasped that this had to be a culture which was designed to gently crash its population. there were many clues that the world was heavily overpopulated and the primary goal of the culture so described was to crash the population without descending into society destroying anarchy - the highly regulated birthrate, which was insufficient to sustain the population. to sustain the population, more than 17 out of each 25 females would have to be assigned to be birth mothers, and this clearly wasn't the case. the replacement rate for a society is about 2.3 live births per female (maybe 2.1 in a society that is safe and careful) - clearly they were implied to be below this ratio so clearly this was a society that was trying to shed population. 
 equally clearly, this was a society that engaged in widespread euthanasia for the most trivial of causes, which hints at a culture which doesn't value life because people are in such abundance that they can be readily disposed of. i suspected that 'release' was euthanasia almost immediately from the context in which it was introduced, and this was almost immediately confirmed when it was revealed that infants were subject to 'release'. clearly, infants can't be meaningfully banished, so clearly release was euthanasia. so i was intrigued by the story. i wanted to see what happened to jonas and his naive family who had so poised themselves on the edge of a great family wrecking tragedy in just the first few dozen pages of the story. i wanted to receive from the storyteller answers to the questions that the story was poising, if not some great profound message then at least some story that followed from what she began. 
 but it was not to be. the first clue that the whole construct was to eventually come crashing down was that jonas clearly didn't understand 'release' to mean 'euthanasia'. nor in fact did anyone seem to know what 'release' meant. this shocked me, because in the context of the setting it was virtually impossible that he and everyone else did not know. i could very easily imagine a stable society where human life was not prized - after all, societies that believe that human life is intrinsically valuable are historically far less common than ones that don't. we know that the society is life affirming, both because we are told how pained and shocked they are by loss and by the fact that jonas responds to scenes of death with pity and anger. what i could not believe in was a society which held the concept of 'precision of language' so tightly and so centrally that the protagonist could not imagine lying could in fact be founded on lies. that's impossible. no society like that can long endure. some technological explanation would be required to explain how the society managed to hide the truth from itself. if release took place in some conscious state of mind, then surely the dispensers of justice, the nurturers, the caregivers, and the sanitation workers would all know the lie, and all suspect - as jonas did - that they were being lied to as well. surely all of these would suspect what their own future release would actually entail, and surely at least some of them would reject it. surely some not inconsequential number of new children, reared to value precision of language and to affirm the value of life, would rebel at the audacity of the lie if nothing else. even in a society that knew nothing of love, even if only the society had as much feeling as the members of the family displayed, and even if people only valued others as much as the community was shown to value others, surely some level of attachment would exist between people. soma or not, the seeds of pain, tragedy, conflict and rebellion are present if ever the truth is known to anyone. 
 nothing about the story makes any sense. none of it bears any amount of scrutiny at all. the more seriously you consider it, the more stupid and illogical the whole thing becomes. we are given to believe that the society has no conception of warfare, to the point that it cannot recognize a child's war game for what it is, and yet we are also given to believe that they train pilots in flying what is implied to be a fighter craft and that the community maintains anti-aircraft weapons on a state of high alert such that they could shoot down such a fighter craft on a moments notice. we are given to believe that all wild animals are unknown to the community, yet we are also given to believe that potential pest species like squirrels and birds are not in fact extinct. how do you possibly keep them out of the community if they exist in any numbers elsewhere? we are given to believe that technology exists sufficient to fill in the oceans and control the weather and replace the natural biosphere with something capable of sustaining humanity, but that technological innovation continues in primitive culture. we are given to believe that they are worried about overpopulation and starvation, and yet also that most of the world is empty and uninhabited or that this inherently xenophobic community lives in isolation if in fact it doesn't span the whole of the earth. we are given to believe that this is a fully industrial society, yet the community at most has a few thousands of people. surely thousands of such communities must exist to maintain an aerospace industry, to say nothing of weather controllers. why is no thought given to the hundreds of other receivers of memory which must exist in their own small circles of communities in the larger community? surely any plan which ignores the small communities place in the larger is foredoomed to failure? surely the receiver of memory knows what a purge or a pogrom is? 
 how are we to believe that jonas's father, whose compassion for little gabriel is so great that he risks breaking the rules for his sake, whose compassion for little gabriel is so great that he risks face by going to the committee to plead for gabriel's life, whose compassion for little gabriel is so great that he discomforts himself and his whole family for a year for the sake of the child, is the same man who so easily abandons that same child at a single setback when he has witnessed the child grow and prosper? doesn't it seem far easier to believe that this same man, who is openly scornful of the skills and nurturing ability of the night crew, would more readily blame the night crew for gabriel's discomfort? i can only conclude, just as i can only conclude about the illogical fact that no one knows what release is, that everything is plastic within the dictates of the plot. jonas's father feels and acts one way when the needs of the plot require it and feels and acts in different ways when the needs of the plot require something else. what i can't believe is that this is any sort of whole and internally consistent character or setting. every single thing when held up to the light falls apart. there is not one page which is even as substantial as tissue paper. 
 it is almost impossible to draw meaning from nonsense, so it is no wonder that people have wondered at the ending. what happens? the great virtue of the story as far as modern educators are probably concerned is that there are no wrong answers. what ever you wish to imagine is true is every bit as good of answer as any other. perhaps he lives. perhaps he finds a community which lives in the old ways, knowing choice - and war and conflict (which probably explains why the community needs anti-aircraft defenses). but more likely from the context he dies. perhaps he is delusional. perhaps he gets to the bottom and lies down in the deepening snow which the runners can no longer be pushed through and he dies. perhaps he dies and goes to heaven, maybe even the heaven of the one whose birthday is celebrated by the implied holiday. perhaps it is even the case that he was sent to his death by the cynical giver, who knew his death was necessary to release the memories he contained by to the community. perhaps he didn't just die, but was slaughtered as the sacrificial lamb - killed by a murderous lie from the one he trusted too well. for my entry in the meaningless answers contest, i propose that the whole thing was just a dream. this seems the easiest way to explain the contradictions. a dream doesn't have to make sense. and the biggest clue that it is a dream is of course that jonas sees the world in black and white, with only the occasional flashes of recognized color around important colorful things as is typical of that sort of black and white dream. perhaps jonas will wake up and engage in dream sharing with his family, and they will laugh at the silliness and then go to the ceremony of twelves. or perhaps the whole community is only a dream, and jonas will wake up and go downstairs and open his christmas presents with his family. a fan gave this to me as a gift at nerdcon this past weekend. i didn't know it existed until then. 
 apparently it's based off a jonathan coulton song. but despite the fact that i'm a coulton fan, i'd never heard it. still, i wasn't terribly surprised. i tend to live under a heavy rock most of the time. 
 despite not knowing the song it was based on, i loved the book. i read it in a restaurant the day after the convention and got all teary. i tried to cover this up by pretending that i was really emotionally involved in my cobb salad, but i don't think it worked. 
 it's a really great book, and when i got done i read it to my two little boys. (and got teary again) they loved it and wanted to hear it a second time. 
 so i read it to them again. 
 * * * 
 update: tonight (one day after our initial reading) i found my older boy (6) reading this book to himself. then my littlest boy (2) carried it over to me and said, ""read daddy read daddy read.""

 when i first saw this book advertised at bea, i did an anticipation-dance while drooling over that cover. it was a very messy dance, like a drunken sprinkler, and i guess it dizzied me into thinking this was a picture book. i couldn't wait to get my hands on it, and the day it came out i barreled straight over to the kids department and after rerouting myself from the picture book section, i grabbed a copy and had to pause for confusion. words?? why so many words? 
 there are actually very few pictures in here, and there isn't even a fox in all of them, which was kind of disappointing at first, but then i read it and there was no more disappointment. okay, there was significantly less disappointment. 
 this is a powerful story; it's harsh, but it's honest. 
 it's war and nature and violence and death and love and duty and loyalty and sacrifice. which, to be fair, would have been a lot for a picture book to take on, but the heart wants what the heart wants. 
 there are some middle grade books that you read when you're a kid that are totally disposable; just reading for reading's sake and you forget all about 'em ten minutes after they're done. but then there are some that are a little more challenging, that inspire complicated emotions lasting well into adulthood. for me, it was island of the blue dolphins, where the red fern grows, the trumpet of the swan, the incredible journey, etc, and i just know that if i were a wee young'un today, this would also become one of those books for me. 
 it's a lovely story about a boy and his pet fox, separated by war, and their struggle to reunite. it's tender and sad and fervent emotional stuff. i didn't cry, because that's a rare and beautiful thing, but i got one of those lumps in my throat that was either temporary cancer or feelings. 
 my roaring about the ending of the book was written immediately after finishing it, and now that i have had a little bit of time to process it, i am somewhat less reactionary. the ending itself is fine - fair and reasonable and not dissimilar to many other books/films of its kind. is it what i wanted to happen? no, but i also didn't want andie to end up with blaine because duh. 
 but i do feel left in limbo - there are a couple of hanging chads bugging me and preventing me from a full-on embrace of the story. i understand with my logic-brain that it's more effective to have the book end where it did in full emotional flower of instead of having a ""time passes"" epilogue or something, but it does give me a little resolution-agita. 
 ending the book there is kind of unfair to the vola storyline. peter spends most of the book under her care, they change each other for the better, but then he takes leave of her so abruptly, neither of them is given emotional closure. obviously, peter is in a hurry to find pax - that's been his goal the whole book long, and time is of the essence, but by not returning to her in some way at the end; whether it be stated or implicit, it feels ungrateful of peter and shortsighted of the author in not giving them a less rushed farewell, or one where there is a more explicit acknowledgment of their paths crossing again in the future. 
 the same goes for peter and his father - there's no sense of how what peter has gone through and the strength and control he now knows himself to have will affect his relationship with his father in the future. peter has grown into a more confident person who no longer worries about inheriting his father's violence, but how will this ""new"" peter coexist with his father? what will their relationship become? they don't get a real confrontation scene, which seems odd, and i don't really understand peter's father as a character. he's severe in his grief, and physically aggressive, yet he's charmed by pax's appearance in the tent, so he's not irredeemably evil. but the scene where the therapist comes to the house is hard to reconcile or explain. i'm not sure what he was so angry about there, or what he is to this book other than ""what peter does not want to become."" 
 i'm not sure what peter's life will be without pax. pax is going to be fine - he has an instant new family to fill the hole peter leaves behind. peter has just had loss (mother) followed by loss (vola) followed by loss (pax), and now he's left with just his father and this war that's going to break at amy minute. 
 and what is this war, even? 
 by choosing to focus on only the micro - the reunion however brief, between pax and peter, it undermines the seriousness of this war; after we have been told to ""tell the truth about war"" and have actually seen the ""truth"" of it as enacted upon the animals, if not the human loss. the war is unresolved, unexplained and mostly just serving as a threat - ominously painting the story's background with its irrevocable approach only to be supplanted by a goodbye scene and left ... still coming. 
 so, yeah -it seems i do still have a problem with the way the ending was handled, but i'm not gonna let that ruin my day or the five-star feel of this book in my heart. 
 the heart wants what the heart wants and the heart is also able to overlook as many flaws as it has to if there are enough strong positive feelings inside. 
 ********************************************** 
 my copy is defective!! different ending please. 
 review to come, regardless of this fact. my impressions in a single word: meh. 
 i recently read this to my little boy, and i have to admit i really didn't care for it. 
 don't get me wrong. it's not a *terrible* book. there's nothing hideously wrong with it. (see my review of esio trot, if you want to see me go off on a dahl book i hated.) 
 but there wasn't much right with it either. the simple fact was mr. fox was not, in fact, very fantastic. 
 the plot centers around some farmers that try to kill mr. fox. they try to dig him out of his hole. fox's clever solution? dig down so they can't reach him. 
 but then the farmers dig *faster.* 
 fox's clever solution? they should dig away faster. 
 eventually they try to starve mr. fox and his family out of the hole. 
 fox's clever solution? dig even farther and steal some food. 
 and that's pretty much the whole book. (spoiler alert.) 
 i like my books to have some cleverness in them. if you have a book where the main character is a fox, and people are going to praise him for being fantastic, he better... y'know... do something if not fantastic, then at least interesting. 
 if your clever solution to *every* problem is ""dig more"" you're kinda just phoning it in. 
 also some mild sexism in here. nothing horrifying like in esio trot, but why read a meh book with mild sexism to your kids? there's better stuff out there. much better. years before i had kids, i taught a class on children's literature. in preparation for that class, i went out and bought copies of every dr. seuss book ever written. 
 since then a decade has passed. i've had kids and read many seuss books to both of them, many many times. 
 so imagine my surprise when i was looking through our bookshelves today and there, among all the seuss, i saw this: a seuss book i don't remember *ever* reading. 
 so i pulled it down and started reading it to my youngest boy, cutie. (not his real name. he's a little under 2). 
 the first thing that struck me as odd was the art. it looked similar to seuss, but it was... flatter. cleaner. the lines were straight and precise. i shrugged it off, thinking to myself that maybe it was one of his later books, and his style was more polished then. or maybe he was trying something new.... 
 but as i kept reading, the words weren't right either. rhyme and meter as flawless as seuss's are delightfully easy to read, but they are a nightmare to write. i know. and while some pages were fine solid others were just... odd. they had bad lines in the middle of good lines. the number of syllables would change randomly from stanza to stanza. or things would stop rhyming entirely. 
 about five or six pages in, i actually closed the book to look at the cover to see if it really said, ""by dr. seuss"" or if i'd been tricked by one of those goddamn abhorrences in book form that pretends to a book by a certain author, but really it's ""based on"" the the author's work. or ""inspired by"" the work. that is bullshit behavior. 
 but no. it said ""by dr. seuss"" right on the cover. 
 so i kept reading it. cutie liked it well enough, but then again, it's not that hard to impress a 20 month old. 
 it got worse and worse as i continued. and after i finished it, i did a little research and found out that this book was published several years after his death. it was discovered as a draft in 1994. it was doubtless finished by someone else, and the art was done by someone else ""based on some of the sketches discovered with his draft."" 
 so, simply said, this is only ""by dr. seuss"" in the very roughest sense. 
 here are my problems with the book: 
 1. the language is bad. the rhyme, meter, and word choice are neither consistent nor good. i could probably go through this book and highlight the parts that seuss actually wrote. 
 if this weren't posing as a seuss book, this would be less of an issue. but seuss was a master of the language. to present this is as seuss though.... it's like going into a restaurant and ordering a bowl of soup and getting a bowel of soap instead. close, but no. it's not really close at all, is it? 
 2. the art isn't the same. it's similar in style, but really not the same in terms of feel. 
 3. the message/moral/plot is... strange/confusing/messy/nonexistent. 
 so is this book painful? is it like eating broken glass or having a nail driven into your eye? no. not really. and honestly, if it was just a random kid's book, it would rank a solid 'meh' from me. maybe a meh-minus. 
 but this isn't being pitched as a random kid's book. it's supposed to be dr. seuss. and this isn't. it *very* isn't. and reading it is like picking up your glass expecting a mouthful of orange juice and instead getting milk. or a bowel of soap. not what you signed up for *and* startlingly unpleasant. 
 so yeah. don't squander your money on nostalgia like this. you're much better off re-reading a different seuss. or, if you're looking for something new, then try out a new kid's book by a struggling new author. that way, at least, you have the chance of finding a new favorite. here all you're going to find is the sad, dim room, empty except for a worn chair where a great man used to sit. just got my copy heck yes i'll definitely start this soon. woah, i can easily understand why such a grand amount of people loved this book and definitely see why many were not satisfied with the movie. i cannot believe how many elements of this story they changed. however, there is something that i must admit: i preferred the movie because of how melancholic and hopeful it made me feel and for the suspense inside it that the book irrevocably lacked. it is not something that i hear myself say often at all. i have always been that little full of criticism girl who could not help but compare books to movies and movies to books. quite a negative experience i tend to have with the latter. i mean, red riding hood (trailer), starring amanda seyfried, was enticing! reading the film-to-novel adaptation though felt like walking through mud - tiring, boring, and endless. why i granted it a three star rating is beyond me. 
 let's just put that aside though. after all, it is of the giver that i shall talk about and my time spent reading the story was definitely not wasted - hence the four star rating - even if not what i anticipated. first, the hero was very young, a detail that i seemed to have forgotten before starting this read. not a problem though, for jonas showed an impressive and admirable maturity in his character. even i, at twelve, and others around me at that time, were not as reflective, wise and...intelligent. sure, math held no secrets from me, but i was not actually resolving problems for the greater good or aware of the true face of the world. as opposite as the situation and context definitely were, the fact remains that jonas lead this story with greatness and, along the way, opened my eyes to some beautiful themes. 
 it shook me to witness how unimportant fiona appeared and how no chemistry was palpable between jonas and her. apparently, they were friends through ashen mostly, or at least that is what i deducted. of course, they volunteered together but it is not as if they talked and shared moments like true friends normally do. plus, we could barely see her because of how her presence was omitted. ashen was definitely endearing in this while, in the cinematographic adaptation - i apologies for bringing it up again - i growled at him continuously. 
 this was another example of a book with fine simplistic writing. my first one, i believe, was aristotle and dante discover the secrets of the universe. then i discovered some others and familiarized myself with this type of writing. i am completely in favour of it since it can bring such a peaceful atmosphere to stories and make the reader easily understand every detail written. however, there is something that i unluckily often stumble upon when this style is present and this was no exception: repetition. but maybe it is easier to distinguish it since everything in the writing is clearer? 
 even though i brought up an equal - or so it seems - amount of positive and negative elements for the giver, i must let you know that the negative ones never bothered, annoyed or frustrated me. they were there, and i was aware of them, but never let any of those weaknesses keep me from enjoying my read. because i did. so much. 
 ps. for a couple of minutes, i thought that i just read one of the first dystopian books ever written, but this list proved me the contrary. it was a rainy morning and i felt like reading neil's new book 'fortunately, the milk'. so i popped on my favourite astronaut t-shirt and caught the bus to my local bookstore, snuffin and kooks. i looked high and low for neil's book, but all that was there were stacks of paranormal romance as far as i could see. 
 ""excuse me,"" i said to the nearest droopy-eyed sales attendant. ""do you have neil gaiman's new book, 'fortunately, the milk'?"" 
 she rolled her eyes so far back that i thought for a moment she was inspecting her own sinus cavities. ""all the hipsters have already bought out our entire stock"" she replied. 
 ""but how could they? don't they know that i have been a fan of his since the sandman days, before he was ""cool""?' 
 she gave two ineffectual chews of something. ""so you are one of those hipsters."" 
 i left in a huff and a grumble, mumbling things about prescription lenses and vampire weekend being a good band anyway. 
 i returned to the bus-stop which which was covered, unfortunately the covering did not seem to be designed to keep the rain off, rather to concentrate the droplets and deposit them upon the head of a waiting passenger. i was soon joined by another hopeful passenger, an old lady who smelt of wet cardboard and boiled sweets. 
 ""you look down dearie,"" she said, and i explained my predicament to her. ""well, i know of a place that sells books. i bet they'll have that neil armstrong book of yours. it's a cafe down the main street there, and you go left down the lane with the shoe store on the corner and it's halfway along on the left."" 
 despite knowing that a cafe that sells books would never sell the books i like, i decided to investigate due to my boredom and to make an old lady happy. i knew the shoe store, but not the lane. i thought it was next to the kebab shop that was quite obviously a front to an underground bikram yoga class. but as i arrived i saw that there was indeed a lane between the two and it had a sign stating that it was ""aquap lane"". it was there that i slipped in the wet and thought that this was too harry potter for my liking. 
 when i came to i was in a dark space with a shrunken man looking a me while holding a candlestick wee willy winkie style. 
 ""where am i?"" i asked the small man. 
 ""you're in a pocket dimension. how did you get here? i don't want them in here!"" he spat at me. 
 ""i was looking for a book. neil gaiman's new book."" 
 ""is it paperback or hardcover? cos you'll only find paperbacks in a pocket dimension. god, what do they teach you kids these days?"" 
 ""calculus. but why do you call this place a pocket dimension?"" i asked. 
 ""because, you see, it is a dimension that could fit in your pocket. it's essentially a pocket-sized dimension it is,"" he explained with a smirk on his face. 
 fortunately this smirk had a half-life of about one and a half seconds. the loss of smirk corresponded to the rise in volume of clanking footfalls. 
 ""oh you did it didn't you? you've gone and bought them. well you'll not get that neal's book from here"", he scorned. 
 ""no it's a neil book, not a neal book,"" i yelled as a group of knights in armour clanked out of the darkness and seized the shrunken man and i. 
 ""well you'd want a briefcase dimension for that kind of thing, not a pocket dimension. but i guess it's too late now."" 
 by torchlight (the ye olde, stinky, fat-covered fire sticks, not the battery powered ones, they're knights dammit) we were led into the inky darkness of the pocket dimension. we walked for what may be days, but it felt like minutes. wait, is that the right way around? well i guess that a pocket dimension has timey-wimey issues. 
 eventually we emerged through an archway into the light of day. it was a garden, a very intricate garden with topiary animals and paths of white gravel. oh no, i thought, an alice in wonderland pastiche by a person who has never read the book and only seen the disney film. but hang on, how did i know that having only seen the film and never read the book? 
 ""off with his head!"" 
 oh great it get's more cliched. 
 ""but can i plead my case your majesty?""i asked. ""i do not know why i am here and what i have been accused of. and, by the way, i thought you were meant to be a queen."" 
 ""well as you can see i am a king. clever isn't it? no, not really. anyhoo, you stand accused of writing an overly long pastiche review that by now no one is reading, nobody has even chuckled at and now you are destroying the fourth wall. or is it the fifth? i've never been one for architecture."" 
 ""guilty as charged your highness,"" i confessed. ""i thought everyone would like it and think i was clever. but i guess all it has ended up being is a waste of a morning when i have more productive things to do. i could have gone to the bookstore instead. hang on, that was in the review universe not the real universe. now things are getting silly."" 
 ""indeed"", confirmed the king. ""and therefore i sentence you to finish this atrocity of a review as soon as possible without using the waking up from a dream scenario. i hate when they do that!"" 
 ""well it would expedite this review if you had a copy of neil gaiman's new book 'fortunately, the milk' that i could read very quickly. that would be mighty helpful your highness."" 
 ""luckily i have a copy right here in my ermine cape. i was reading it earlier and i found it a quite fine read. i did not like the ending though. who'd have thought that all that time the milk was the murderer not the train driver? absurd."" 
 ""well no need to read it now. thanks anyway."" with all the garbage going on in my life right now, i forgot that it was dinovember! time to catch up!! 
 another item to add to the list of ""ways in which i was failed as a child."" 
 1) not born a redheaded princess 
 2) no pony. not even one. 
 3) made to eat canned green beans. seriously - i know it was the 70's but come on! we had a garden!! 
 4) never once woke up to a tableau of dinosaurs behaving badly, complete with smashed dishes and dino-graffiti all over the walls. 
 because the four children belonging to the authors of this book get to wake up to such tableaux thirty days out of each year!!! and probably have never even heard of canned green beans. 
 this book is, i think, a book of professionally-photographed reenactments of previous dinovembers, judging by the impeccable lighting and staging compared against the images available on their own internet places like here and here, and also the fact that so many of these pictures seem to be catching the dinosaurs in the midst of their tomfoolery, rather than a scene being discovered the morning after by lucky, cherished children. 
 for example, detective karen notes that this sink hasn't overflowed and the bubbles are still fresh and frothy 
 and this popcorn in still in midair: 
 which reminds me - so very many of these stagings involve butter. so much butter wasted. but also - not smooshy as it would have been after several hours. 
 and whatever is happening here definitely hasn't been there for too long. 
 i don't even know where you get enough ice to do that, let alone thinking you can fool the reader of this book into believing this was a stage set and left for the kids to find in the morning. a kid looks at that picture and thinks ""fun!"" a grown-up looks at it and thinks ""who is going to pay that bill?"" thankfully, ""fun!"" was my first thought, so i'm not quite grown yet. 
 and while it must be so magical to wake up to mischievous dinosaurs every morning for a month (although i have no way of knowing for sure because of how shamefully i was deprived of dinosaur stagings) i have a couple of reservations about the irresponsible behavior these dinosaurs exhibit. 
 never mind how much food they waste 
 or the dirrrrty-play they encourage: 
 but this - this!!! 
 this is crazytown!! this is a scene you stage for children ranging in ages from 1-7??? i mean, i understand you wanna thin your herd, considering how high your food-and-freezer bills must be, but this is basically an encouragement to misadventure! dcs would see this as a confession. watch your back. 
 i love that a great deal of the time, the funniest parts of the scenes are things that are happening off to one side or in the background. there's a lot going on in here, and i love it. 
 this is my favorite of all the dinosaurs: 
 because his expression can either be rage or terror or glee depending on what is going on around him. 
 and i liked this bit of evolutionary cannibalism 
 but most of all, i like that this book finally taught me what killed the dinosaurs: 
 ""food"" poisoning. 
 guess i won't be going extinct anytime soon! 
 great pictures, usually funny captions, genius idea. 
 i will leave my door unlocked for you please. 
 this is the last day of dinovember! 
 (to be sung to the tune of: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hnqo...) ""dear old world,"" she murmured, ""you are very lovely and i am glad to be alive in you."" 
 this quote really accurately depicts how anne lives her life and what makes you love her as a character. she's stubborn and makes mistakes, but she also has a huge imagination and sees the world as beautiful and full of possibilities. 
 i loved this so much and i'm sad i never read it before! i love all the characters and the plot, and it's really fun to see anne grow up through this book. the writing is also really really lovely. 
 i can't wait to read the sequels and follow anne's story! 
 this has made it up to my favorite books of all time list, that's for sure. 
 reread notes 
 i didn't think i could love this book more but somehow i do?? i am so emotional. *reread july 2017* 
 reread for booktube-a-thon 2017! do i really have to tell you i loved it? i think you should know that by now! so amazing. i can see many rereads of this in the years to come. if these pictures don't show you why you need this book, there's no hope for you. 
 and yeah, yeah, yeah, this isn't goodpictures.com and we're all of us first and foremost readers here and we love a good story more than anything else, but sometimes pictures printed in startlingly vivid color 
 on heavy-stock paper 
 in which the illustrations are seemingly bursting out of the confines of the page 
 all sewn between two pleasantly soft clothbound boards 
 can make words take a backseat for a little while. even for creatures such as we. 
 the words don't make up a bad story, it's just a bit meandering and lackluster and can be summed up as, ""oh, there it is."" 
 but if you're reading this book for the articles, you're doing it wrong. this is one of those books you appreciate because it is a beautiful object, one that you will take down and admire when you just need the comfort of something pretty in front of your eyes. 
 and i can personally attest to the fact that it makes a wonderful gift! one i will revisit and flip through way more than, say, don quixote. 
 so there. 
 winner of that argument = me. poor baudelaire siblings, life really hasn't been easy on them these last few days. the misfortune that incessantly befell them was heartbreaking. 
 but the children are strong, so strong, and intelligent, and brave. they don't have anyone else in the world but each other. 
 i fell for them as deeply as i fell for a little princess' sarah. how could we as readers not, after beholding such tragedy? 
 because the orphans are so likeable, which led me to care for them and their future, i never wanted to stop reading. being assured that violet, klaus and sunny would find their happily ever after was my first preoccupation. 
 many events conducted the lives of the baudelaires and, although they were unmistakably unhappy and antagonistic ones, i found charming how much we learned about the characters from them. 
 however, the story and its protagonists are not the only elements that will enthral readers. i personally thought the writing style to be delightful... simple but elegant and effective. without being overly descriptive, it produces vivid (grotesque) images in the reader's mind. 
 while i understand why some disliked the liberty the author took in interrupting the flow of events for a second or two to swiftly provide a definition for certain words (or expressions) more literal, i was never bothered by that and in fact welcomed the process. 
 i couldn't do anything else but read this in one sitting. they called to me, those dear baudelaires. 
 blog | youtube | twitter | instagram | google+ | bloglovin' sometimes i like to curl up in a ball, so no one can see me because i'm so small. 
 sometimes i like to jump high as i can 
 to see how much noise i can make when i land. 
 sometimes i like to scream ever so loud, not that i'm cross, i just like how it sounds. 
 sometimes i like to just walk round and round 
 i pigeon step pigeon step, till i fall down. 
 sometimes i like to stand still as a tree, 
 and watch everyone rush around about me. 
 sometimes i like to poke out my tongue 
 or make funny faces, now that can be fun. 
 sometimes i like to get in a real mess 
 with mud on my feet and my hands and my chest. 
 sometimes i like to run ever so fast, i sometimes come first, but i sometimes come last.* 
 but when the day ends and the sun starts to fall, then i do what i do best of all. i find somewhere soft, somewhere cozy and small...and that's where i like to curl up in a ball... 
 so do you guys know what this means??? it means that i am a wombat!! this is the best news ever. 
 *it may not look like i am moving very fast here, but i am. ask caris. he's that speck in the distance... i honestly could not give this book any less than 5 stars. it was beautiful and heartwarming. i felt so much for george and really connected to her. this book is just so important, and whilst as a middle-grade this is an easy ready with a simple writing style, i think that everyone should read it. oh my goodness i absolutely adored this! this brought me right back to childhood since i loved the movie as a kid, so glad the book is just as good!! merry merry merry!!! 
 this world will never stop delighting me. 
 how can this be?? how can all the pieces of this puzzle coexist?? who is religious enough to create a book that tells the story of the nativity in a real, straight way, without any humorous adaptations that is deemed appropriate enough to be marketed as a religious book, shelved accordingly, but not too stodgy-religious to use guinea pigs to represent biblical figures and dress them up like mary and joseph to tell the story? 
 or an angel: 
 or king herod 
 who gets mad 
 but still - still! deems jesus special enough to not be played by a real live guinea pig, but is instead a doll: 
 is that out of respect?? is it a sacrilege to dress up a guinea pig as jesus?? or would the baby pigs just not stay still long enough?? or are they just too icky when they are babies?? or is there some more insidious commentary going on here??? i don't know. all i know is that these guinea pigs are dressed up. in the biblical sense. 
 how does this even exist in the world and why did it take so long?? and the best part is that these delightful guinea pigs are actually rescue guinea pigs, so it's nice that they get to be stars after some stupid squeezy-handed kid decided they didn't want a pet anymore, and they get credited and everything. except jesus. who is, once again, a doll. 
 also nice to see the flexibility w/r/t traditional guinea pig gender roles. if a girl guinea pig can grow up to be king herod, then the world must truly be a better place than the world before this book was in it. 
 merry freaking guinea pig christmas best day ever this book!! 
 in the words of the author(s) 
 where have you been all my life?? 
 this book is just insane amounts of fun. the premise is very simple: danny is a greedy little boy who learns an important lesson about why we don't try to test the limits of santa's generosity. because santa has tricks up his sleeve, and ways to make naughty boys into nice boys for next year's reckoning. 
 santa leaves danny a single present - a giant dinosaur egg. 
 which hatches. 
 and the dinosaur goes nuts, eating everything in sight - the tree, the decorations, danny's family... 
 also santa, which seems like an oversight on santa's part. 
 and this makes danny sad. 
 which makes the dinosaur sad 
 with the feeling of guilt 
 in the dinosaur's gut, 
 its brain brewed a plan 
 involving its butt. 
 it knew there was only one thing it could do: 
 to put christmas right, it needed to... 
 amazing. 
 please forgive those squiggly lines - i still haven't learned how to photograph off of a nook properly. the camera sees things invisible to the naked eye. 
 but so back to the poo 
 and it's a christmas miracle. 
 christmas is restored, just with a little more poo than anticipated on the decorations and whatnot. 
 and everyone learns a lesson. 
 i love this book so much. 
 and i must read the other books in the series, because one can never have too many books about poo. 
 also - behold - there is a game attached to this book that you can play for free and it has just eaten up a lot of my time. i am very bad at it, but it is fun. 
 now it's your turn to fall into a timesuck: 
 http://www.randomhousechildrens.co.uk... 
 you're welcome. 3.5 *all the world is made of faith, and trust, and pixie dust* stars 
 this truly is an odd book. there were plenty of disturbing, surprising wtf moments. i made the stupid mistake of reading some peter pan theories that really creeped me out. things i'm scared of- the wizard of oz movie, clowns, praying mantis, john travolta. now i can add peter pan to my list. 
 this book genuinely creeped me out. yes there are bittersweet and endearing moments. the characters are compelling and well-developed. but to be honest i contemplated quitting. 
 *rains of castamere starts playing* 
 i don't want to ruin your experience by divulging too much, so i will keep this short. 
 yes, there were moments of weirdness but i made it. i finally read this classic. i am, unfortunately, a female version of peter pan. i'm still a child at heart. 
 tinker bell warmed my heart. my fondness for her derives from several factors: her mischievous personality, her joie de vivre and her fierce loyalty to peter pan. i have always had a fondness for fairies. don't even bother telling me they're not real, because i simply won't believe you. 
 there's a little bit of peter pan in all of us. yes eventually we may have to leave neverland but we will always remember. yes!!! my least favorite book in my favorite series! it just keeps getting better and better, folks. 
 so, for the three misguided people who havenaeur(tm)t read this series - first off, get on that. what are you doing? there is nothing so important in your life that you canaeur(tm)t put it off in order to read this series. 
 https://emmareadstoomuch.wordpress.co... it might seem odd to review a book that has 10 pages and less than 20 words in it. but when you're dealing with books for very little kids, that's the landscape you're dealing with. 
 barely 15 minutes ago, my littlest boy brought this book up to me and said, ""read daddy! read!"" 
 that's the baby version of a 5-star review. 
 what really makes this book good, is that it's one of the very first books you can read to your kid. it will catch and hold their attention *long* before they can follow anything with plot or words. this just has dogs making different barking noises. 
 both my boys loved this book, and cutie went through a period where there was nothing in the world funnier than one of the dogs going ""yip yip yip."" 
 he would laugh and laugh whenever i said that. huge helpless baby chortles. why? who knows. and who cares, really? we were having a great time reading a book together. and that's what really matters. happy mother's day to all of you mothers/people with mothers/abbesses/prioresses/etc.!!!!! 
 so, after being given a janked-up e-copy on netgalley and losing two firstreads opportunities with this book, i finally shelled out the ten bucks and bought a copy for myself. and what i (finally) learned from this book is how happy it is to be a baby animal. 
 i also learned some facts: 
 *anteater pups ride on mom's back for the first ten months of life. mother and pup's black stripes line up with one another to preserve their camouflage. 
 * the african painted dog can give birth to a litter as big as nineteen pups 
 * female pandas are only fertile for 2-3 days a year, while the java mousedeer can become pregnant 2 1/2 hours after giving birth. 
 * the canada lynx may be in the running for cutest yawn ever 
 i also learned how much nibbling there is in the animal kingdom from both mommies and babies alike. 
 nature is delicious! nom nom 
 and that mothers are fearless 
 but mostly i learned how sweet and tiny baby animals are. which i already knew, but half of education is repetition, after all. 
 but i also learned about lies!! 
 1) though small at birth, king penguins grow into the largest and most handsome adult penguins. 
 chinstrap penguin objects 
 2) you are not that echidna's mama, lady! 
 here are two for greg!! 
 fennec foxes 
 and bat-eared foxes 
 but my one complaint?? how do lions rate 5 pictures and red pandas only one? 
 the injustice! 
 ********************************************* 
 ***** update: this book is now up as a firstreads giveaway. i am going to try to win, but it'd better be more than just some blank green pages or karen smash.*** 
 ********************************************* 
 okay, as much as i hate to do this, i'm calling it. time of death: now 
 i was approved on netgalley for this book on january 23. and i said ""yaaayyyy baby animals."" however, when i tried to download it, only 18 of the 160 pages showed up. 
 since it didn't say anywhere on the netgalley page that this was only a sample of the book, and since the page did say ""email allowed,"" i emailed on jan 26. no response. i emailed again on feb 26. no response. this thing is going to be archived soon, so whatever, i give up. 
 the 18 pages i was allowed to see include the galley disclaimer: 
 this little thing, which is probably the flier that is put into arcs and not actually part of the book itself: 
 this green page: 
 this green page with animal silhouettes: 
 this green page with animal silhouettes and the title of the book: 
 this green page (for those of you counting, this is page 6 of 18 - we are 1/3 through what was given to me for review and there is zero actual content so far): 
 the dedication page: 
 this green page: 
 this title page (page nine - halfway through now) 
 the introduction: 
 and the glossary of acronyms used in the book (i mean, i assume they are used in the book. i have no way of knowing): 
 and on page 12 - our first bit of actual content which is two paragraphs about the northern sea otter. 
 pages 13, 14, and 15 are photos of a baby sea otter and its mother, and page 16, 17, and 18 are photos of a baby hippo and its mother, and yes they are being adorable, but it would have been nice to see more of the actual book and maybe fewer plain green pages since i'm meant to be giving feedback on the book and all. 
 there's no accurate way to rate or review a book based on 6 pages, so i guess i'll just wait and buy it when it comes out like someone who didn't get approved by netgalley and subsequently ignored by the publisher. 
 lesson to be learned: ""email allowed"" does not necessarily mean ""email returned"" or even ""email acknowledged."" 
 thanks, i guess. 
 ********************************************* 
 oh my god wookit those red pandas!!!! i would (s)mother them like crazy!!!!!! love love love 
 also: counting this as my first booktubeathon read even if i read only 2 pages during the actual readathon, i need all the books i can get ""but are you really pro-life?"" asked alice. ""because you know, i've heard pro-life people talk before, and they sound quite different."" 
 ""when i use a word,"" trumpty drumpty said, in rather a scornful tone, ""it means just what i choose it to mean -- neither more nor less."" 
 ""the question is,"" said alice, ""whether you can make words mean so many different things."" 
 ""the question is,"" said trumpty drumpty, ""which is to be master -- that's all."" 
 alice was too puzzled to reply to this, so she thought she had better change the subject. 
 ""that is a fine wall, mr. drumpty,"" she said after a while. ""it must have cost you a great deal to build it."" 
 ""it cost me nothing,"" said trumpty drumpty off-handedly. ""every single cent of it came from my friends in mexico."" 
 ""they must be very good friends,"" said alice politely. 
 ""not in the least,"" said trumpty drumpty. ""but they had no choice, you see. first, i sent back all the illegal immigrants; and then i said that if the mexican government didn't pay for my wall, i'd stop those immigrants from wiring any money home."" 
 ""but if you had sent them back,"" said alice, who was now feeling even more puzzled, ""then how--"" 
 ""you ask too many questions, young lady,"" snapped trumpty drumpty. ""this interview is now over."" 
 ""nothing is going right today!"" alice said to herself. ""oh, how i wish i hadn't taken that job with fox news!"" we've had this book for a while, and i was surprised to find that i hadn't already written about it on here already 
 simply said: my kids adore it, and so do i. 
 it's a fun story about a young girl who opens her house up to mythical creatures, has some problems with her thoughtless guests, then resolves them. nice pacing. lovely illustrations. 
 the mythology isn't half-assed generic stuff either. partially based in folklore, partially original. ben brought in the folletti, which i had to look up. if i knew of them at one point, i'd forgotten about them. 
 what puts this over the top as a kids book are some of the invisible extras. not morals, because morals are too frequently preachy and heavy handed. i'm just talking about good, socially nutritive stuff that it's nice to have in *any* book. but that's triply nice to have in a kid's book. 
 for example, julia is a great character who happens to be a girl. as opposed to being a tough girl character doing it for herself despite the fact that she's a girl and girls are usually seen as helpless in our culture (tm) she's hospitable and hard-working. she takes care of her own problems. 
 it's nice to see julia get frustrated, then talk with people and make changes that will fix her frustrations. it's nice to see people behaving thoughtlessly (which makes them rude), then changing their behavior to be helpful (which makes them kind.) and it's nice to have a kid's book where everyone has chores, because that's something kids should be exposed to in books. 
 i love this approach in books. it's not preachy or pushy, but it has good things in it. it's not like someone forcing medicine down your throat for your own good. it's the equivalent of a healthy, delicious meal. 
 so yeah, highly recommended. 
 pat who ever said an actor cannot be an author? no one ever, because it's not true at all. 
 well this was such a lovely surprise. the world that chris colfer introduces us to is filled with magic, charming creatures and familiar names of princesses, princes, fairytale heroes and heroines. 
 although i'm one of those readers who can read anything from children's books to mature adult books, it doesn't mean i like everything i stumble across. for my middle grade reads, i look for 1. creativity, 2. enchanting and 3. deep. 
 ''the land of stories: the wishing spell'' has a lot to offer: an enthralling adventure, relatable heroes, a scavenger hunt like never before seen, lots of encounters with our favourite fairytale characters and, most of all, the type of storyline that offers something new with every new chapter. 
 granted, alex and conner do find most of their objects in a relatively easy manner and short amount of time; they're offered help everywhere they go. but isn't a fairytale world supposed to be good and better than our own? where kindness is not questioned and unceremoniously reciprocated? 
 i enjoyed every second of my time with this book. i'm going to have to say that the beginning is not as great as what follows the eighty first pages, and that is because we are still in the human world before that, but once alex and conner reach the land of stories, it's good time after good time after good time. 
 to all of those who haven't read this yet, y'all are some lucky fellows to be able to experience this story for the first time. 
 blog | youtube | twitter | instagram | google+ | bloglovin' winnie-the-pooh, light of my life, fire of my loins. my sin, my soul. win-knee-the-pooh: the tip of the lip taking a trip of three steps down the palate to return at four to kiss : pooh. he was pooh, plain pooh, in the morning, standing eighteen inches in one sock. he was that scruffy old bear at school. he was mr winnie pooh on the dotted line. but in my arms he was always bear. i can't express how much i love this book. my son is currently whining because he's supposed to be napping. 
 yeah, good fucking luck on that one. 
 but this book is so awesome because it's true. i think i've thought almost every word in this book toward my son at some point. 
 seriously, boy! mummy needs her goodreads time so go the fuck to sleep!!! in high school i loaned this to a girlfriend and then she dumped me and then i called her house like every day all ""give me my book back"" until she finally left it outside my door so she wouldn't have to talk to me. 
 i was a pretty big fan of this book. just a wonderful, magical, extraordinary book. the kind of classic-feeling book you can put in the hands of a little girl and feel confident that with it, she will grow into a wonderful, magical, extraordinary creature herself. it might work on boys, too, who knows? but right now i am speaking to the fathers i know with young daughters who are looking for that book that will leave an impression on them in a literary role-model kind of way: a strong and smart and brave little girl raised by an eccentric man who may not have taught her much about how to be conventional, but who has shared a love of language and adventure, and has raised her to be fierce and loyal and courageous and independent. 
 and on top of the glowing character(s), the language of the book is pure milky chocolate - just lovely and unexpected prose that really stands out when compared to any other book ever. this is a book i would have read until it fell apart if it had been around for me when i was, say, eight or so. this is a book you read when you are little and then take to college with you and then hand down to your own daughters. it is for sickbed reading, reading aloud, savoring and treasuring and pulling down from the shelves as needed. this book is begging to be inscribed and given as a gift. 
 there is nothing i don't like about this book. and there is no way i can do it justice. an extended quote is the best i have for you. 
 sophie is our young heroine, charles the man who took her in as a baby when she was found in the water after the capsizing of a boat, and miss eliot the social worker who disapproves of the whole situation. here: 
 miss eliot did not approve of charles, nor of sophie. she disliked charles's carelessness with money, and his lateness at dinner. 
 she disliked sophie's watching, listening face. ""it's not natural, in a little girl!"" she hated their joint habit of writing each other notes on the wallpaper in the hall. 
 ""it's not normal!"" she said, scribbling on her notepad. ""it's not healthy!"" 
 ""on the contrary,"" said charles. ""the more words in a house the better, miss eliot."" 
 miss eliot also disliked charles's hands, which were inky, and his hat, which was coming adrift round the brim. she disapproved of sophie's clothes. 
 charles was not good at shopping. he spent a day standing, bewildered, in the middle of bond street, and came back with a parcel of boys' shirts. miss eliot was livid. 
 ""you cannot let her wear that,"" she said. ""people will think she is deranged."" 
 sophie looked down at herself. she fingered the material. it felt quite normal to her; still a little stiff from the shop, but otherwise fine. ""how can you tell it's not a girl's shirt?"" she asked. 
 ""boys' shirts button left over right. blouses - please note, the word is blouses - button right over left. i am shocked that you don't know that."" 
 charles put down the newspaper behind which he had retreated. ""you are shocked that she doesn't know about buttons? buttons are rarely key players in international affairs."" 
 ""i beg your pardon?"" 
 ""i meant, she knows the things which are important. not all of them, of course; she is still a child. but many."" 
 miss eliot sniffed. ""you'll forgive me; i may be old-fashioned, but i think buttons do matter."" 
 ""sophie,"" said charles, ""knows all the capitals of all the countries of the world."" 
 sophie, standing in the doorway, whispered, ""almost."" 
 ""she knows how to read, and how to draw. she knows the difference between a tortoise and a turtle. she knows one tree from another, and how to climb them. only this morning she was telling me what is the collective noun for toads."" 
 ""a knot,"" said sophie. ""it's a knot of toads."" 
 again - there is nothing i do not love about this book. while re-reading this series my main question is why the hell is an incompetent banker the only adult helping these children. like where are the police or social workers???? usually, i'm annoyed with books that present a dead character in a story and even make them part of the main cast, because we don't know them as well as the characters in the book do. 
 but ali benjamin succeeded to make me care about suzy's best friend who drowned and died, leaving her friendless and feeling alone. 
 except suzy was already friendless even before her best friend died. 
 in the story, there is the past and the present. the past focuses on the relationship between suzy and her best friend, as if she were writing in a journal to franny. the present focuses on suzy trying to find an explanation to franny's death. 
 in her own way, she is coping with her best friend's death, but not in the right way. she's not moving on. it's like she's not able to move past this until she is able to prove that franny could not have really perished in a drowning accident, seeing that she was a great swimmer. 
 it's a very moving story. and very sad, also. i cared so much for suzy, and although my heart was breaking every time suzy made a connection between franny's death and jellyfish (which was always), i kept on reading with the hope that things will turn out okay for suzy. 
 ali benjamin's writing is simply beautiful. it's easy to get lost in her words, to let them envelope us. congrats to her for writing a wonderful, realistic story with the theme of grief and loss. 
 blog | youtube | twitter | instagram | google+ | bloglovin' former president george w. bush named this his favorite book from childhood (it came out when he was 23 ... but perhaps he meant his kids' childhood). in any event it's one of my favorites from my childhood, and from reading to my own kids. was it the first to put holes through its pages? probably not, but it worked very well. kids like sticking their fingers in things - genius! 
 anyhow - this is one hungry caterpillar! he puts a hole through everything be it a slice of watermelon (or wacca menon as my daughter first said it), ice cream cone, or sausage. 
 it is in fact one of the bestselling books in the history of literature! 
 http://mark---lawrence.blogspot.co.uk... 
 so what does this epic teach us? 
 1/ everything in moderation. our caterpillar just sticks a single hole in each food item - he ain't that sort of greedy, he'll leave some for others. 
 2/ try new things. our caterpillar ain't picky, he'll try anything once, even gherkin! 
 3/ eat healthy to avoid stomach ache. a nice green leaf will sort you out. 
 4/ change is good. straighten up and fly right and you too could become a beautiful butterfly and... um ... fly, right!

 books are all so different, just like people are different. morry is a young book on the shelf and longs to be read. he wants fingerprints, smudges, and bent corners. the older books in the library tell him heaeur(tm)s better off just staying on the shelves, but heaeur(tm)s persistent and decides that anythingaeur(tm)s better for him than living a life of nothingness. he's thinking about jumping off the shelf in hopes of being discovered when a book named jane gives him a shove and morry falls to his back. this part is quite scary as some of the books prove to be a little violent. follow along in the story to find out if morry will ever be discovered. 
 what an imagination it took to write this book. the faces on the books are so realistic and the conversations between the books are hilarious. when you study the faces on the books, youaeur(tm)ll notice that they're the true authors themselves! i thought the illustrations were very colorful and interesting. once you get to the end, the author mentions all of her favorite authors that sheaeur(tm)s enjoyed in her life, some of which are used in the book. itaeur(tm)s thought-provoking even for adults when you think about how some of the classic authors are all smudged up with heavy wear, and then others havenaeur(tm)t been touched at all. overall, itaeur(tm)s a good book that kids will enjoy. 
 4**** i think i'll be filming a video review about this one, so i'll keep it brief: this was fantastic. the writing was a bit too simple for my taste (it's written for children, so it makes sense) but other than that it was perfect. this book is crap, and let me tell you why. the kid is a jerk and is sent to his room without supper. he proceeds to go to some magical place where these monsters live and he bosses them around and is mean to them. then he gets back home...having not learned that being a mean jerk is wrong...and there on his table in his room is dinner...and it's still warm. what's the lesson here exactly? 
 hate the book. a moat is not a goat is a collection of 13 poems celebrating all that is wonderful about little girls. for those of you with daughters, you will recognize your little girl in one or more of these poems. perhaps you will recognize the brave little pirate girl who, donning a crown, pink gown, and a glittery cape, heads off on the high seas seeking adventure by writing her own stories (""true treasure""). or perhaps, your little girl is like the one who maybe cut her own bangs (or fringe) a bit too short (""snippety-snip""). or perhaps your little girl has a vast imagination and wishes to explore far-off kingdoms, deep oceans, or places where dinosaurs roam through coloring with crayons (""happiness""). 
 the messages hidden within these short poems vary depending on the theme of the poem, but they all have one thing in common: they all have the potential to empower little girls. for example, the last line in the poem happiness states ""happiness is knowing that all toys are both for girls and boys"". in move over, miss muffet, little miss wafer learns from miss muffet's experience and keeps herself safe from a snake by climbing into a hammock. the walk-away lesson at the end of the poem is ""for where there is a plan, there is a way!"". 
 my favorite poem is sniffle, sniffle which reminded me of shel silverstein's poem ""sick"" (which i happen to have recited in elementary school at a poetry competition). in this poem, the little girl, staying home from school, is hoping to read, watch tv, eat ice cream and otherwise play on her ""day off"", but she is disappointed when ""mom made me stay in bed all day."" that's a lesson for parents! 
 the illustrations in a moat is not a goat are magnificent! i absolutely loved them! the illustrations all feature the most adorable little girls representing cultural diversity as well as diversity in settings. i also like that the girls were sometimes dressed up in ""girlie"" clothes (i.e., dresses) featuring colors that you would typically associate with girls (i.e., pink); but some of the girls were dressed in pants or overalls in more gender-neutral colors. in this way, girls can know that it is ok if they want to dress up in ""little girl"" clothes, but they can also choose to dress in more gender-neutral or ""boy clothes"" if they prefer. the only thing i would say is that all the girls were depicted with at least shoulder length hair. it would have been great to include shorter hairstyles as well. 
 my bottom line: 
 a moat is not a goat is a wonderful collection of short poems (varied length) celebrating little girls! each poem features culturally diverse little girls in a variety of circumstances all centered around the message of empowerment. the accompanying illustrations are absolutely gorgeous. i highly recommend this wonderful collection of short poems to teachers, librarians, and parents to read to children. while girls are the obvious target, i do think the book would make a great discussion starter exploring gender stereotypes in a classroom setting. ages 4 to 8. 
 * i purchased a kindle version of this book from amazon. all opinions expressed in this review represent my honest opinions about the book. except for the persistent india bashing, i loved this book. in fact mistress mary, i loved the ending so much that i forgive your english superiority complex. next time you visit here though, allow me to take you on the ride across india, i hope your impression will change february 
 as part of my personal reading challenges for 2017, once a month i will be revisiting a favorite book from when i was a little bitty karen and seeing if it holds up to my fond memories and determining if i can still enjoy it as an old and crotchety karen. 
 fingers crossed. 
 so: first things first. in answer to the question 'does this book hold up?' yes, it does. again, i read this book so many times as a kid, there was a cozy-blanket familiarity to reading it so many years later, but i felt just as invested in anda's struggle as i did when i was a kid, and the book didn't feel childish at all. it's a genuinely good story with a realistic character at its center whose frustrations and determination make her genuinely sympathetic and likable. 
 baby-karen's review: 
 i like this book because i am very good at gymnastics* and i liked it when anda rescued that cat from the roof but it was sad when it got hit by a car but i'm glad it was okay even though it got hit by a car. my dog got hit by a car one time and he was not okay so it's good her cat didn't die. i also liked the blizzard because i love the snow. 
 adult-review: 
 i think this book is responsible for my adult love of dance movies. the plot is pretty much the plot for every dance movie ever - young unwealthy girl has all the talent and grit to land her in the highest echelon of competitive world mostly populated by affluent peers, but is held back by poverty-based obstacles: missing a competition because the rusty old truck breaks down, missing practice because a sick goat must be tended to, without even a telephone to make other transportation arrangements, but lo! opportunity in the form of a scholarship is within her grasp, if only she can win better than anyone else and become a star! 
 no better drama, no more fulfilling triumph. 
 this has all the ups and downs of an olympic backstory: sacrifice millie! mollie! , overcoming illness, injury and innate stubbornness, learning self-control, harnessing all that unfocused energy into discipline, and accepting that life isn't all tumblesaults; sometimes you gotta learn ballet, too. 
 her mom's kind of a drag, though. i'm not sure why i'm scrutinizing the adults in these books so much as i reread them, except for the fact that i am closer to their age than anda's, and when i was a kid, grown-ups weren't interesting, and i didn't have an adult perspective. but now, money woes are unfortunately very familiar to me, and having just read you will know me, which is about a family with a gymnast prodigy and how everything revolves around her training and the sacrifices they have to make in order to afford that lifestyle, i can understand where her parents are coming from, with the caution and stress-crankiness. but her mom is pretty chilly, for a hippie with a backyard fulla goats and chickens. she's not horrible, but she has enough moments where you wanna shove her outta the way of anda's path to glory. 
 a few loose comments: 
 i totally had a crush on anda when i was little, and i used to think this picture was real cute. 
 but now i am old and that kind of thing is creepy, so i have to get over her. sorry, anda. 
 i had forgotten this took place in england. there's no big revelation there, it was just a moment of ""oh, yeah,"" when i saw the glossary at the front, where some of the terms are 'translated' for non-british readers. 
 i did find one error that i must have missed as a kid, because it didn't spark anything in me. but bella is indeed a special cat: 
 ""oh look, daddy! she's got pink feet! her paws are pink on the bottom. like pink beads! look at her white whiskers! oh, she's got little white eyelashes! why are her eyes blue?"" 
 ""they'll change,"" said bill, steering murgatroyd carefully round a group of moorland sheep. ""they'll go green as she gets older. or yellow. oh, she's magic, isn't she?"" 
 she is magic, because her eyes go both green and yellow. about thirty pages later, she has green jewel eyes, and then about twenty pages after that, they are yellow. kaleidoscope cat! 
 i am very excited to continue this rereading project. will they all hold up?? let's find out! 
 * adult edit - childhood self-confidence aside, i was not ""very good"" at gymnastics. i was tragic on balance beam and, like anda, i hated the floor-dancing parts. the only things i was good at were the ones where you fling your body about without worrying about the landing parts - i was strongest on vault, decent at uneven bars, and i liked the flippy parts of the floor routine, because wheeee. but ""very good?"" not hardly. 
 **************************************** 
 just as good as i remember! review to come! for now, fume with me over the fact that there are two other books connected to this one, making this a little gymnast trilogy, that i never knew about and am now gonna need to track down.

 the second of my middle grade rereads for 2017-project. 
 this one has a different bookplate: 
 and another ""how karen kept track of her reading when she was a baby"" account: 
 and it was even cheaper than wait till helen comes! 
 will it hold up!!?? let's see! 
 january: wait till helen comes 
 march: zucchini 
 april: something queer at the library 
 may: good-bye pink pig 
 june: the girl with the silver eyes 
 july: the phantom tollbooth one of the great tear-jerkers of my long-lost childhood, the unlikely friendship between a spider and a pig makes for wonderful reading and a shared moment of love when reading it to kids. it is tender and teaches the values of constancy and integrity in a light, beautiful prose. a classic and a masterpiece. this book infuriated me! what a lazy author. taking us down the garden path through 12 books and then ending the series without really completing the story. as a children's librarian, i no longer recommend this series to kids. i hate to see them as disappointed as i was at this really stupid final book. shame on you, mr. snicket!! you took the chicken's way out. next time, have an idea of where you expect the series to go before you start it. truly shameful. what a silly qs!! 
 of course i do love books, & sure i want some adventures 
 and above all i adore the magic of cinema

(i know. couldn't you just die?) 
 this girl, as yet scarcely old enough to have a couple of cherries or a leaping dolphin tattooed near her cameltoe, was named dorothy. one day, like so many dreamy-eyed girls, she donned her skechers and her discount department store jeans and waited for a meteorological disaster to rescue her from her sad, glitterless rural life. 
 as luck would have it, one day, an especially violent cyclone (rated ef4 by the local weather service) carved a bloody path of destruction, misery, and death through central kansas, carrying dorothy's trailer (with her and her dog toto inside, watching judge judy) high into the troposphere. at first, dorothy mistook the rhythmic vibrations for a circuit party and looked under the bed for her whistle, but soon enough she realized she was airborne. and it felt fab. u. lous. she thought she even spotted a cross-country virgin america flight with diana ross sitting in first class refusing a skunky glass of chardonnay and calling the stewardess an uppity white bitch. (she'll have dershowitz on the phone when she gets to lax.) but maybe dorothy was unconscious and imagining it all. at any rate, she was immune to the ghastly, soul-rending shrieks, rising from below, of a kansas mother cradling her dead baby who was impaled by a windswept awl in the cyclone. she was busy listening to ""yahoo!"" by erasure on her ipod. 
 eventually, after floating around earth's gaseous atmosphere for a couple of hours, dreaming of barney's co-op sale, dorothy landed in some unknown land, flat-ironed her hair, and repositioned her training thong. outside her trailer a bunch of ghetto midgets were milling around with some old witchy broad. no, it wasn't that uberfem glinda - like in the movie - it was some tired-ass old mannish thing, looking like linda hunt in the year of living dangerously. basically, this bitch is no help at all. she's supposedly a witch, and you'd think she'd know the way to the meatpacking district, but all she does is give her some cheap-ass silver shoes (steve madden - yuck) and kiss dorothy on the forehead leaving this ""magical"" lipmark. dorothy suspects it's herpes simplex one and hightails it outta there before the witch gives her boxed wine and has her pose for ""art"" photographs. (yes, i remember the very special episode of diff'rent strokes with gordon jump very well, thank you very much.) 
 okay, you know the rest of the story (for the most part). dorothy seeks out the wizard of oz by mapquesting emerald city (or, alternately, the city of emeralds) and on the way she meets a scarecrow, a tin woodman, and a lion, who are all needy and want to bask in the glow of her super-hot blinding aura and fierce fantabulousness (and bum a few amphetamines). the wizard, who likes to mix up his corporeal manifestations, appears to them in his emerald city throne room (picture antwan ""big boi"" patton's house on cribs but with fewer stripper poles and lots more green marble ) in the forms of a giant little richard-sized head, a sears catalog swimsuit model, a vaguely menacing monster, and a talking ball of fire. obviously, the wizard has been to see cirque de soleil and knows the power of a little quebecois razzle-dazzle. whilst filing his nails and reading the latest issue of interview with drew barrymore on the cover, the wizard tells his motley supplicants that, yeah, yeah, sure, he will grant their stupid, retarded wishes if they murder the wicked witch of the west, a tribeca scenester who is always bogarting page six with her leather-daddy winged monkey warehouse parties. dorothy & crew reluctantly agree - an act of volition which effectively makes dorothy the youngest hit girl in the history of ya literature, and the only one to ever wear lace-trimmed socklets. eventually, during a wet t-shirt contest, the witch melts and dorothy, still flush with her first taste of killing... sweet killing, returns with her entourage to the wizard to claim her payoff. but then, gosh golly, gee whiz... in a startling atheistic allegory, the all-powerful wizard is revealed to be an impotent little wallace shawn-type standing behind a screen fiddling with some sound board knobs. nietzsche couldn't've said it any better. the wizard, who realizes he's dealing with a bunch of saps here, pretends to grant everyone's wishes (except dorothy's - cuz he's totally jealous of her fabulousness) and they actually fall for it. dorothy, burnt-out on the emerald city scene and suffering from dehydration and exhaustion, longs to return to kansas to start her autobiographical blog. a bunch of stupid stuff happens, some of which involve a hot air balloon and bitch-slapping trees, and the quartet make their way to glinda, the witch of the south, to see if she can grant dorothy's wish and thereby prove that she's at least somewhat less worthless than everybody else in oz 
 on the way to the glinda's 'hood, the posse comes across a village where all the people are made of china and break easily (gee, i wonder why they left that great episode out of the film), and after the lion accidentally destroys one of their china churches with his tail (i'm not kidding), giving impetus to hate crime legislation the world over, the tin woodman decapitates some wolves with his ax. dorothy skips and frolics through the gory pools of matted fur, blood, and steaming viscera and asks glinda, who appears to be on quaaludes, for a trip home. glinda, as useless as every other allegedly magical person in oz, tells her that the cheap-ass steve madden shoes she's been wearing could've gotten her back to kansas all along. (and, by the way, when she returns to the sticks, she should really take off those chinese panda-skin leatherette things. they'll give her fatal foot rash.) 
 so dorothy uses the magic of those shoes made in china under the brand name of a man imprisoned for magical tax evasion to return to kansas, where her aunt and uncle have long since forgotten about her and adopted a more attractive, latvian girl who's not too prissy to hand-inseminate the cows. dorothy overdoses one night in a dilapidated feed barn on a potent mixture of robitussin and gas-x, and judy davis plays her in a television movie that no one remembers long enough to have forgotten. 5 stars from my little girl, jess (age 7).

 ""i'm glad that matilda can live with miss honey."" tolkien must have been an excellent farther to his children. to put so much thought and effort into the making of these letters speaks of nothing but devotion. they're so well crafted by a master of the pen. the calligraphy, alone, is fantastic to look at. it's quite revealing too. it's like a little peek into the family life of the tolkien's, one which shows the patriarch as a kindly gentleman that he no doubt was. this is a great little book. 
 i do recommend this edition in particular because it shows the original print along with a text version. this means it can be read easily because some of the originals are quite dense. true story: when i was a kid, our school librarian read this to us in class. that night when i was drifting off to sleep, i found that the creature had followed me home and was scratching on the wall right outside. which was totally unfair because i hadn't even taken his damn tailypo. i mean, do your research, jerk... i had to sleep in my parents' bed for like a week. and that's why i have no younger siblings. way to go, tailypo. i'm reading through this series with my daughter celyn (10 years old, very disabled, hence dad does the reading). 
 edit: finished & reviewed all 13! 
 so, this is a clever, entertaining book set in a world like ours but populated with bizarre characters and with distinctly dark undercurrents. 
 recurring themes throughout the series are: 
 i) adults are mindbogglingly stupid. 
 ii) the narrator, lemony snicket, is a character we glimpse in tantalising snatches. 
 iii) words that stretch a child's vocabulary are used regularly but defined in context (by the narrator) in an amusing way. 
 iv) the three siblings, violet (14), klaus (12), and sunny (1) will use their singular talents (respectively inventor/bookworm/biter) to solve the problem. 
 v) that problem will be count olaaf 
 the book (like roald dahl's work) succeeds with a combination of wit, slapstick, and malice. 
 short, very readable, will leave you wanting the next. 
 this one sets the scene, rapidly orphaning the children, establishing the goal (to survive long enough to take control of their huge inheritance), and their adversary (count olaaf and his theatre troop of sinister villains). 
 we have ten of the books because my elder children loved them when they were young. on book 5 i'm thinking we'll probably read them all. 
 edit: i have now posted reviews of all 13 books in the series - check them out!

 .. if i could give this more stars, i would. 
 yes, i know the title indicates this book is for rebel girls. i am a mother of two fairly rebellious boys - but felt it was every bit as relevant for them as it was for females! after all, why shouldn't boys read about fabulous, inspirational women too? 
 this book is an absolute thing of beauty - 100 accessible, creatively written tales of women who helped to shape the world we live in. the illustrations are superb, and it hits just the right note with my two kids (5 and 7). they were initially suspicious that it was going to be one of those 'educational' books, but a few stories in and they were hooked. 
 people with boys, don't be deterred from buying this book, simply because the title indicates a female bias. it's so important that we start recognising the achievement of women (past and present) because they've so often been ignored - and both girls and boys can benefit from this. also - a word of warning, grown-ups are likely to get a bit hooked on it too. :-) oh how i wish i had read this wonderful book when i was a little girl. 
 and i seriously think this would make a magnificent animated story. 
 it's just that charming and magical. i mean, i suppose you already assume that from the original title and beautiful cover, but i can assure you that there is no exaggeration about them. 
 from the setting to the story to the characters, everything is marvellous. but really, who never dreamed of owning 100 gowns - exquisite gowns? 
 but wait a second, these dresses don't only make you look extraordinary... they also make you look different. indeed, put them on and you become someone else completely. 
 when darling discovers them, she is in awe. shocked, but then again, she wished for an adventure, and well, adventure found her. 
 it truly is a fun book. truthfully, the writing could have been more fairytale-esque and we sure could have seen a little more of princess mariposa, but darling and her friends - including the animals - as well as the rest of the characters bring this book to life with the intention of enthralling the reader. 
 and it works. it does one hell of a job of gripping our attention. i must admit there are repetitions, which are understandable since one is bound to find routine when dwelling in the same place, but i seriously believe an escapade somewhere would have done the plot wonders. 
 but whatever, it's still so, so loveable. if you want to add sparkles to your childhood or just brighten your day, pick if the magic fits up! you won't regret it, darlings. *wink* *wink*

 pre-review: 
 you know what? i've been wanting to reread these books for probably a decade, and i'm still (inexplicably) battling my ever present book funk, so i'm just gonna do it. 
 gilbert blythe, you were my first and best book boyfriend. see you soon ;) my reaction after reading this: 
 2 stars 
 whoa? 
 why? 
 really? 
 so first off i would like to say that i really really really wanted to like this book since many human beings read and love this book and many have considered this as one of their favorite books of all time and before i posted my rating i browse the ratings of other gr members so that i know that i'm not the only abnormal human being who doesn't think that this book is good or great or whatever!!! 
 (*coughs* sorry i forgot to turn off the capslock, i'm not shouting or anything *coughs* just please don't judge me *coughs* if you like the book, i respect you for that, but i really can't force myself into believing i like this book _(>.<)v) 
 okay i'll try to explain what i don't like about it: 
 1. the book is boring. 
 2. the book is weird. 
 3. i don't feel any emotions at all towards the character. 
 4. i don't really understand the book. 
 5. i don't really understand the ending. 
 6. i don't really understand why this utopia world should have no colors, no feelings and no music so that the people would live *coughs* decently. 
 7. i don't really understand why the children at age whatever should be given ribbons, what's the purpose of that? 
 8. i don't really understand why the characters should tell about their dreams to their parents. 
 9. i don't understand why johnas has to take medications because he was having stirrings. so stirrings for those who haven't read the book is somewhat closer to wet dreams. 
 10. i don't understand why the memories of war, loss etc. would make someone want to end his/her life or give up on life. i know that life is imperfect but it seems that the characters have no backbone, like idk i don't buy the logic of that one. 
 11. in short i don't really understand this at all! 
 if you're wondering whether i've read this one because it's a school requirement, the answer is no. i buy this book because i've seen it on the list of best ya book here on goodreads so many times. and if these book is bombarded with symbolism then please explain this to me(since i don't have brains for symbolism people!), especially the ending (what the fudge is that?) and i might change my rating, i repeat might. un libro tan brillante como una estrella. me corrijo: mi estrella. la que, para mi, siempre sera la mas brillante. `ndm bd't hdh ljz knt mtkhwf mn 'n jd 'hdth mshbh@ lljzy'yn lsbqyn..wlkny knt mkhty'

 . shrbyny overrated. it practically begs the reader to come to the conclusion that if you don't ""get it"", it's your own fault because you're a ""grown up, and only kids can see what matters"". the truth is, there's nothing to get. it's heavy handed, clumsily executed observations on what's important in life. it's not wrong by any means, but it's the kind of pseudo-intellectual detritus that 
 freshmen philosophy majors will discuss as they pass the joint. 
 i'm going to go with a literal interpretation of the plot, because why the hell not: 
 a man crashes his plane in the desert, hallucinates a small alien boy that teaches him philosophical lessons, invents a history for him, finds a well just in time to stave off dehydration, as he re-hydrates, his hallucinated alien friend kills himself and disappears, he fixes his plane and flies home and is sad about it, but feels blessed for the experience as it has changed him. 
 ready for the moral? it's really simple: 
 ""it is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important."" or in other words, spend your time developing relationships, don't worry so much about the things, they're not important, it's the time you spend and how you spend it that is. 
 that's a nice philosophy, i get it, but this book is silly. we actually finished this last night, but i had already updated our reading so whoops! i'm going to include her star rating for the review's rating, but will try to include both our ratings here as well. there was something so special when we were starting chapter six and she kept asking ""just one more chapter please mama!"" until we had finished the entire book! the story did a fantastic job of drawing both adult and child in right from the beginning and i appreciated all the dinosaur information included for children to learn facts while reading. the ending left us with a magical feeling and she immediately said ""i can't wait to start the next book!"" which made my mama heart happy. 
 mckenna rating: 5 stars 
 mama rating: 4.5 stars 
 i'd say this was a win any way you look at it. highly recommended! 
 ********************************* more sloth mania!! 
 this is an adorable book about a little girl who wants a pet. her mother tells her you can have any pet you want as long as it doesn't need to be walked or bathed or fed. 
 so she gets... a sloth! in the mail! 
 and while sparky the sloth is very adorable and huggable with his ""flat nose and monkey face"" 
 he's not the most ... playful pet. 
 nor the most obedient 
 which is a problem because she has already boasted to the bratty and scoffing mary potts that sparky's a great pet, and she's going to prove it by putting on a big show where sparky will perform astonishing tricks. 
 oh, and there will be glitter. 
 and it's all so adorable i can almost overlook all the lies! 
 because of course sloths need to eat! 
 and be bathed 
 and okay, maybe not walked. sloths are not the best at distance. but they'll still come to getcha! 
 until they get too sleepy 
 and while this one girl couldn't get sparky to play with her, sloths are actually pretty good at hide-and-seek 
 and also at whatever this game is: 
 but then - again - too much exertion makes a sloth sleepy 
 so, yes! an adorable picture book that you need to have in your collection. 
 special thanks to catherine for writing this review which alerted me that this book existed. 
 and also special thanks to kristin (kc) for giving me this little treat happy birthday greg!!! 
 a review for greg!!! 
 this is a wonderful little book; part of jean craighead george's american woodland tale series, which are cute little illustrated chapter books about animals in the wild and the things that they do. while we are exposed to the inner thoughts of vulpes, he is, thankfully not a fox that talks, so there is a semblance of realism here. he has motivations for his actions, but they are very practical. vulpes doesn't sit around yearning for things or trying to make friends with the human characters or anything. he finds food, he finds a mate, he learns about the dangers of his environment. all things that foxes actually need to do in order to survive, with none of the disney singing owls or clumsy woodpeckers. 
 but most importantly, there is a scene in which vulpes hunts for food under the snow. like this: 
 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2sogh... 
 which is the coolest thing foxes do. howdeedoodat??? 
 now, since this is a realistic-type story, i got some bad news for you. look, nature is a tough broad, and not everything in this book is going to be smiles and fuzzy hugs. 
 so, to cheer up the way i felt at the end of this book 
 okay, better now. i have a bunch more in this series, but i'm not sure i can face the widdle raccoon just yet. 
 but soon, once i regroup, emotionally. loved this book so much! 
 i loved auggie. 
 cant wait to see the film ""the library of souls"" is out now!!! get yourself a copy today & get ready to be spooked: https://t.co/2kjyddg25j all of the stars for a favorite children's classic!!! 
 i loved this book as a child! i have several copies -- at minimum: the dog-eared paperback from when i was a girl, a wonderful antique hardcover, and the kindle version. i have wanted to reread 
 a little princess 
 since i joined gr in 2014. today, i borrowed an audio version from hoopla on a whim -- after recently seeing another reading buddy doing rereads of childhood favorites. i am so glad that i read it again!!! unlike some other childhood favorites that i have revisited, i loved this as much ... if not more than i did as a youngster!! 
 the following link has a synopsis of this wonderful story - as well as a listing of the many versions of the movie that were made. i do fondly remember the one starring shirley temple; however, i always preferred the book!!

 top 3 favorite quotes: 
 ""never did she find anything so difficult as to keep herself from losing her temper when she was suddenly disturbed while absorbed in a book. people who are fond of books know the feeling of irritation which sweeps over them at such a moment. the temptation to be unreasonable and snappish is one not easy to manage."" 
 ""what you have to do with your mind, when your body is miserable, is to make it think of something else."" 
 ""i am a princess. all girls are. even if they live in tiny old attics. even if they dress in rags, even if they aren't pretty, or smart, or young. they're still princesses."" 
 it was so much fun revisiting this classic by 
 frances hodgson burnett 
 that i am motivated to read more of her works (including some adult novels). potentially, i will reread 
 the secret garden 
 as well!!! 
 audiobook - i listened to the 2016 version narrated by karen savage. there are many versions to choose from. this version was well narrated and compelling (but i haven't listened to other versions to compare). my only constructive feedback is that an announcement is made at the end of each chapter (i.e., end of chapter 2....) and then there is a few seconds of white space before the next chapter begins. i'm not used to this, but it (obviously) didn't impact my enjoyment of the book. at least 2 versions are available on hoopla. time required is about 5.5 hours. this is not a book review so much as a fulfillment of a request by ladies whose whims i cannot refuse... 
 r(est) i(n) p(ubescence): a study of child mortality in battle royale and the gashlycrumb tinies as historical documents 
 edward gorey was an american illustrator, and as such his children, or ""tinies"", meet their ends in very american ways. they all have ""accidents"" befall them. (excluding the suspiciously-like-suicide situations of zillah, neville, and james) this book is seemingly representative of the american attitude towards blame, circa 1963. everything that happens is unfortunate, but the parents are not responsible. what was ida doing by the lake when she drowned? probably eating apple pie and supporting our troops. and rhoda was simply lighting 4th of july sparklers when she became consumed by fires. written today, all of these drawings would be followed by a panel indicating what steps were taken w/r/t litigation, after the children's deaths. the peach orchards would be sued for allowing ernest to choke upon a peach stone, the train company would be paying for victor's death for years to come. but this historical artifact is an exercise in cause rather than effect, and certainly free of affect. it is coldhearted american realism with an anti-abortion message. if there are stairs, your children will fall down them, so the more children you make, the less you have to actually look after them. just play the odds... 
 battle royale on the other hand, takes the japanse perspective. japan is a country smaller than california, but it has about a zillion people on it. their concerns, as depicted in this novel seem to be about downsizing their population, and embracing martial darwinism. suicide is not an option for the japanese - that is military old hat (helmet?) for them, and far less entertaining than drugging an entire class of children and making them fight each other to the death on an island while wearing schoolgirl miniskirts. this is a bold political move to bring in some revenue, and to make room for their businessmen and oversized monsters. only the strong and the crazy will survive, and that is predicted to make for the most interesting gene pool. 
 here, the children are expendable, as they are in gorey's tract, but ultimately the two philosophies have different endgoals. gorey claims ""yes, your parental fears are valid - children are fragile and will inevitably come to harm,"" which encourages americans to stay in their bedrooms, ignore the children they already have (who are going to fall whether they are being watched or not) and make more babies for america, while in battle royale, the teens have their intercourses during the actual games, so that murder and death are shown to be the most effective forms of birth control, which keeps the population down, and lessens the need for future battles. 
 kids are gonna die, it's a fact of life. 
 but some are gonna go out in a blaze of glory with a scythe. if you are interested in stories with happy endings, you would be better off reading some other book. in this book, not only is there no happy ending, there is no happy beginning and very few happy things in the middle. this is because not very many happy things happened in the lives of the three baudelaire youngsters. violet, klaus, and sunny baudelaire were intelligent children, and they were charming, and resourceful, and had pleasant facial features, but they were extremely unlucky, and most everything that happened to them was rife with misfortune, misery, and despair. i'm sorry to tell you this but that is how the story goes. 
 i am ashamed to say that i have had this 13 book hardback boxset since 2013 and i am just now getting around to it. i put it on one of my challenges for this year but now i'm thinking i might should wait for the tv show on netflix. i wonder when that is coming out. 
 ***some spoilers*** 
 these poor kids! they are just having a day of play when they find out their parents die in a fire at their house and they have nothing. 
 and mr. poe who is oblivious and lives in his own little world sends them to life with a distant relative - the evil count olaf! all he count wants is the children's money that violet is to get when she comes of age. 
 olaf makes the children do horrible chores, cook, sleep in one bed and the house is atrocious! but the kids do find some peace with the neighbor, justice strauss. she lets them cover over and read books from her library. oh the joy of that =) 
 but the evil olaf has a plan to get the money all for himself and he almost succeeds but violet is a little too smart for old olaf and i loved it! 
 i saw the movie for this years ago and i think someone told me it is compiled of the first three books. i thought it was good though. i am really looking forward to the netflix tv series and the rest of the books! 
 my blog: melissa martin's reading list when i first saw this cover online, months before the book was released, i thought to myself, ""i will make you mine."" 
 and then i did. 
 surpeficially, the artwork reminded me of a cutesier shaun tan or a less-gross renee french. but i know nothing about art, and when i mentioned this observation to art-snob sean of the house, he scoffed and pointed to a couple of illustrations and said ""shaun tan would never do that or that,"" so i guess i'm wrong. sean of the house does not care for the art in this book, but i love it, so i choose this book over him. 
 this is a wordless picture book in which a little girl is left alone at home and decides to take the bus to visit her grandmother. she falls asleep and misses her stop, and when she disembarks, she finds herself deep in the forest with no one to ask for help. no human, anyway. fortunately, she meets a beautiful and mysterious stag, 
 who takes her on a magical journey where they meet other creatures 
 before she is eventually restored to her parents. spoiler alert, yeah, but it's a children's book - how did you think it was going to end? 
 it seems like a sweet, whimsical story, but its inspiration comes from a sadder and more haunting source. the bus and getting-lost parts are true, but the animal-intervention was not. the author is chinese, and she came up in the 1980's under china's one-child policy. from the author's note: 
 when i was young, both of my parents had to work to support our family, so during the day, my grandmother would take care of me. but still, sometimes - if they had to rush to work or if nai nai was busy - they would leave me home alone. this experience was common in many families at that time. i belonged to a very lonely generation of children. 
 and this loneliness permeates the illustrations, even when it is - yes, sean - a little cutesy. 
 i just thought it was lovely, and tender without veering into saccharine 
 it made my heart go ba-dump awww!! there were genuine feels inside. i thought it was a beautiful story, beautifully illustrated, and even though it came out of her memories of isolation and loneliness, it's not bleak - there's so much fun to be had when you have a stag! 
 i definitely want to see more books from this author/illustrator. with more baby seals! we have in egypt this saying; 
 ""who sees the unfortunate events of others feel solace about his own unfortunates"" 
 ""lly yshwf mysfwrshnt yfynts lns thwn `lyh mysfwrshnth"" 
 so, 2016 wasn't my year -est, 2011- and now i'm hitting ""rock bottom"",having ""a series of unfortunate events"" 
 so i said, why not give this title a try 
 ""accompanied by this mysterious black cat that sat with me the whole 2 hours read"" 
 it's really dark-fun misfortune kids orphans' story.. 
 and a gothic villain. 
 and the author himself, mr. lemony snicket; 
 who advises you repeatedly that this book is sad and misfortune and not with a happy endings..and please close it or return it if you can't handle all this misfortune.. 
 even the tv show latest adaptation tells u to just 
 look away, well... that's true... you should stop reading this review now as well..look for something happier. 
 but as our beloved mother country saying...which i said earlier, i didn't look away. 
 and that was.....sickly fun. 
 the story 
 ------- 
 the baudelaire 3 children lost their parents, their huge house and everything they own in a fire... but not their huge bank account. 
 mr.poe, the banker is the one responsible to see them to the 'proper' guardian. proper here refer to something that never happened.. oh he delivered them to a guardian, but proper is not a suitable word to describe count olaf. 
 who's has nothing to do with them but plotting to get his hand of their fortune. which they even can't get their hand on it till the eldest -violet,14- come of age. 
 to try to get their fortune. he puts them in a series of unfortunate events. 
 and by the second half of the book one.. his first grand plan is to wed violet by deceive .. 
 how , how can they know the deceive, how can they escape his plan without endanger their lives??? that's the book one for you. 
 oh and no matter what do you think.. the author stick to his word. 
 no happy endings here.. 
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
 the writing style 
 ------------- 
 it's really like children book, the style, the easy sentences and even when the author use a big or fancy word he always give the meaning of it even if it's easy in a very funny way. also he does that in expressions and literature techniques as well. 
 it's sarcastic and if it's really a children's book..it's the darkest one ever written. 
 if you read of mr. lemony snicket's real life you'll feel he's been 'forced' somehow to write a children books. it's 1999, the phenomenon of harry potter was on the catching fire stage.., that's why the result comes like it's a satire of children books.. satire here means a dark fun sarcastic imitation of normal life children books. 
 the creating of the lemony snicket constant commentaries through the book as a detective who investigate the baudelaire orphans' series and tell this as a story for ether very young readers, or slow ones, that worked as a very funny 'comic relief' amidst all the misfortune unfortunate events series. 
 'comic relief' here means small funny moments that gets between more tensed or serious ones. 
 well.. 
 that's it for a small book reviews. i over talked it i guess.. but i really loved this absurd dark fun of... 
 unfortunate events.

 16 january 2017 
 to 17 january 2017 i have such fond memories of this from seeing the old movie version as a kid. i never got around to reading it then, so i thought i'd give it a go! 
 the family togetherness and sense of adventure is all there. it's just lacking musical accompaniment and sound effects. it is an old 'un so the writing felt a bit stiff. i'm a fan of other writers from johann david wyss' era and his grammar style falls more towards someone like james fenimore cooper than say a jane austen. 
 i guess my real quibble is the lack of tension here. yes, certainly there is danger inherent in being stranded, especially upon an island that could house unknown beasts. but i never had the impression they were ever in any real trouble. good old dad seemed to have things under control. 
 also, i felt more than a passing need to suspend disbelief at some of the family's goings on. for castaways they sure were well supplied from that shipwreck! well i suppose their seemingly infinite supplies of gunpowder that never spoiled were needed in order to blast away at the island's animal inhabitants. honestly a more appropriate title for this would be shoot to kill! a less catchy but even more precise title would be we killed a lot of animals: the story of a family stranded on an island, who were never in serious danger and who - i believe it has been mentioned, yet bears repeating - killed a lot of animals. the way they hauled off and shot at the slightest movement in the bushes was nearly worse than some of the drunken yahoos i've hunted with. 
 the swiss family robinson is a family adventure story and as such should probably be read as a family when the kids are young. i don't think it's meant for us old, knitpicky grumps. oh, what a huggable book! 
 it's such a lovely, heart-warming story. if i had a kiddo, i'd recommend this book to them right away. 
 it's centered on friendship, family, illness and maddie's unconditional love of science. although there are many themes, all of them are beautifully developed. no exception. 
 plus it's such an original story, despite the scenes and situations often found in middle grade books, such as broken friendships for petty reasons and sibling fights. it still feels very much honest and genuine. 
 i just loved the writing and narration. the inclusion of sops (standard operative procedures) entertained the hell out of me. not only is it the signature of this book, but it's used in a clever manner. i was always looking forward to them as i was reading. they're creative and meaningful to the plot. 
 maddie is a relatable heroine. granted, it's rare to see middle schoolers this interested in science, but maddie's father is a scientist and so was her grandfather, so it 1 - made sense and 2 - added uniqueness to the story and her characterization. i definitely think many will connect with her difficulty in making true friends. 
 definitely a story not to miss on. 
 blog | youtube | twitter | instagram | google+ | bloglovin'"," the next asteroid the little prince came to was inhabited by a quiz addict he sat hunched in front of his laptop and barely looked up when the little prince greeted him there was nowhere else to sit since the whole asteroid was covered in books 
 ""good morning"" said the little prince 
 ""i'm sorry i don't have time to talk to you"" said the quiz addict ""i am very busy wait in twilight what color was edward's car"" 
 ""i don't know"" said the little prince ""i have never read this book twilight"" 
 ""i think it was blue"" said the man ""damn i was wrong silver in twilight who joined the cullen family first"" 
 ""i told you"" said the little prince ""that i haven't read this book but it must be an interesting book if you answer questions about it all day long i would very much like to read it"" 
 ""it is the stupidest book ever written"" said the man 
 ""then why do you answer questions about it all day long"" asked the little prince 
 ""because if i don't"" sighed the man ""then my friend on asteroid b451 will get ahead of me ""he has read the whole series luckily he hasn't read harry potter and the deathly hallows"" 
 ""when you have finished the quiz"" asked the little prince ""i hope you will be able to read some of these books you have around you i notice that you have had atonement on your to-read list for the last six months"" 
 ""it is a never-ending quiz"" answered the man ""in twilight what color was edward's car"" 
 ""i believe you said silver"" answered the little prince politely 
 ""thank you"" muttered the man ""yes you were right i should have known that"" 
 ""i'm sorry i must be going"" said the little prince and he went on his way thinking that grown-ups were very very very strange lowry's book is a piece of nationalist propaganda using oversimplification emotional appeals and dualistic morality to shut down her readers' minds more troubling is that it is aimed at children who don't yet have the critical faculties to defend themselves from such underhanded methods 
 unsurprisingly lowry adopts the structure of the monomyth equating a spiritual journey with a moral one her christ-figure uses literal magic powers to rebel against his society this rebellion and the morality behind it are presented as 'natural' to contrast with the 'abnormal morality' around him 
 lowry doesn't seem to understand that we get our morality from our culture it isn't something in-born that we 'lose' this is the first hint of lowry's misunderstanding of the human mind she assumes her own morality is correct and then builds her story to fit it 
 she also makes the character act and think like a modern person would despite never adequately explaining how he came up with such unusual notions it's the same trick many historical fiction authors use leaving us scratching our heads as to why a fourteenth century french peasant speaks like a second-wave feminist i'd suggest that lowry falls to this fault for the same reason they do: she has no talent for imagining how others might think differently 
 lowry's book ends with the standard nonspecific transgressive spiritual event that marks any overblown monomyth since the book is not a progressive presentation of ideas it does not suggest any conclusion instead the climax is a symbolic faux-death event (symbolic of what none can say) confusingly lowry later redacts the ending in the sequels undermining the pseudo-spiritual journey she created 
 though some call this book 'dystopian' it's closer to the truth to say lowry borrows elements from the dystopian authors attempting to combine the spiritual uplift of the monomyth with the political and social deconstruction of the dystopia what she doesn't recognize is that the faith of the one conflicts with the cynicism of the other she draws on ideas and images from many other authors: bradbury huxley orwell burgess but doesn't improve upon them 
 these authors created novels that reflected the world around them they based them on the political events of the times presented with realism and careful psychology though they presented the struggle between the individual and the society they portrayed morality as grey and suffering as the result of individual human faults not political systems lowry doesn't realize that the best way to critique fascism or communism is not to present it as 'evil' but to simply present it as it was 
 but lowry's world is not based in reality it is symbolic and hyperbolic instead of writing about how poverty makes the world seem small and dull she has the characters magically unable to experience life instead of an impersonal government she presents a sort of evil hippy commune 
 the only political system it resembles is a school which is a neat little trick to get the kids interested the idea that 'school=unfeeling totalitarian hell' is not an uncommon one but it's one i'm surprised teachers would support the book also suggests a creche but lacking similarity to any real-world system it doesn't work as a political criticism 
 lowry creates this artificial world to suit her purposes but it is not a symbolic exercise like 'animal farm' we understand that the pigs of animal farm are symbolic because there are no talking pigs lowry's world is more insidious since its oversimplification is hidden she builds an artificial world to support the dualist morality that she's pushing she presents the same knee-jerk fears about euthanasia and abortion that people use against women's rights or health care 
 worse than these straw man arguments is the fact that she never deals with the economic causes of totalitarianism tyrants don't just rise up and take control by their own force of will they come into power because of the socioeconomic situations that surround them lean times produce strong fascist leaders while profitable times produce permissive liberal societies 
 strong centralized leadership simply doesn't self-propagate in cultures where everyone is clothed fed and housed the holocaust was socially about some ideal of 'change' and 'purity' but it was economically about the transmission of wealth from jews poles and catholics to germans (and more specifically to those germans who had elected the new ruling party) 
 the atrocities of war are for the most part committed by normal people on other normal people by presenting the power structure as 'amoral' and 'inhuman' lowry ignores the fact that people will willingly cause others to suffer painting the enemy as 'evil' and 'alien' is just an unsophisticated propagandist method 
 she contrasts her 'evil' with the idealized 'goodness' of emotion beauty and freedom this is nothing more than the american dream of 'specialness' that mr rogers was pushing for so many years we are all special we are all good we all deserve love and happiness sure it sounds good but what does it mean 
 where does this 'specialness' come from if it is just the 'sanctity of human life' then it's not really special because it's all-encompassing if all of us are special then none of us are there's nothing wrong with valuing life but when lowry presents one mode of life as valuable and another as reprehensible she ceases to actually value humanity as a whole instead she values a small idealized chunk of humanity 'people are good except the ones i don't like' is not a moral basis nor is it a good message to send to kids 
 if the specialness is only based on fitting in with a certain moral and social guideline then lowry isn't praising individuality she's praising herd behavior the protagonist is only 'special' because he has magic powers his specialness is not a part of his character it is an emotional appeal 
 the idea of being a special individual is another piece of propaganda and its one kids are especially prone to because kids aren't special: they are carefully controlled and powerless giving a character special powers and abilities and then using that character to feed a party line to children is not merely disingenuous it's disturbing 
 there is also a darker side to universal specialness: giving a child a sense of importance without anything to back it up creates egotism and instability adults noticed that children with skills and friends had high self-esteems but instead of teaching their children social skills and knowledge they misunderstood the causal relationship and tried to give them self-worth first 
 unfortunately the moment unsupported self-worth is challenged the child finds they have nothing to fall back on their entitlement didn't come from their skills or experiences and so they have nothing to bolster that sense of worth instead any doubt sends them down a spiral of emotional instability 
 a single book like this wouldn't be the cause of such a state in a child but it does act as part of the social structure built to give a sense of worth without a solid base for that worth people like to believe they are special kids especially so but being a remarkable person is not a result of belief but of actions if the book had informed them then it would leave them better off but giving them a conclusion based on emotional appeals does nothing to build confidence or character 
 many people have told me this book is good because it appeals to children but children often fall for propaganda children develop deep relationships with pop stars breakfast cereals and japanese monsters this does not make them good role models for children 
 feeding 'specialness' to kids along with a political message is no better than the fascist youth programs lowry intends to criticize the obsession with individuality is just another form of elitism it's ironic that people in america most often describe themselves as individuals when pointing out the things they do to align themselves with groups 
 but banding together in a community is not a bad thing for lowry and other 'red scare' children any mention of 'communal' can turn into a witch hunt but we all give up some personal rights and some individuality in order to live in relatively safe structured societies there are benefits to governmental social controls and there are drawbacks and it's up to us to walk the line between the two anarchy and totalitarianism never actually exist for long: we are social animals 
 it's not difficult to understand why lowry is so popular especially amongst educators the message she gives aligns perfectly with what they were taught as kids from red scare reactionism to the hippy-dippy 'unique snowflake' mantra these ideas aren't entirely misguided either it's good to recognize the benefits of difference and the dangers of allowing other to control our lives 
 if a reader believes that fascism and socialism are inherently wrong and that their own individuality is their greatest asset they will likely sympathize with lowry's work however this doesn't make the book honest nor beneficial one of the hardest things we can do as readers is disagree with the methods of authors we agree with ideologically 
 it makes us feel good to find authors who agree with us but this is when we should be at our most skeptical searching the world for self-justification is not a worthwhile goal it simply turns you into another short-sighted argumentative know-it-all 'yes men' never progress 
 lowry is toeing the party line she does not base her book around difficult questions like the dystopian authors but around easy answers she doesn't force the reader to decide for themselves what is best she makes it clear what she wants us to think her book is didactic which means that it instructs the reader what to believe 
 even if her conclusions about individuality vs community are correct she doesn't present arguments she only presents conclusions like rote memorization or indoctrination she teaches nothing about the politics social order economics or psychology of totalitarianism or individuality the reader is not left with an understanding just an opinion 
 the baseless 'individuality' of the book lets the reader imagine that they are rebels--that they are bucking the system even as they fall into lock-step by letting the reader think they are already free-thinking lowry tricks them into forgetting their skepticism 
 she is happy to paint a simple world of black and white and this is likely the world she sees i doubt she is purposefully creating an insidious text she just can't see past her own opinions she writes this book with a point to make and makes it using emotional appeals and symbolism she doesn't back it up with arguments because she doesn't seem to have developed her opinions from cogent arguments 
 in the end she doesn't show us that the structure of this society is wrong she says nothing poignant about individuality vs community; instead she relies on threats to the life of an innocent infant yet nowhere does she provide an argument for why communal living or the sacrifice of freedoms for safety must necessarily lead to infanticide 
 in politics making extreme claims about the opposing side is called mud-slinging it is an underhanded and dishonest tactic it works arguing intelligently is difficult accusing is easy so that's what lowry does 
 she is another child of wwii and the cold war who hasn't learned her lesson she quickly condemns the flaws of others while failing to search out her own even after the holocaust there are many racist nationalist violent jews; conflict rarely breeds a new understanding 
 america condemned the faceless communal life of the second world and yet america created the projects we critiqued strong governmental controls but we still have the bank bailout socialized medicine socialized schooling and socialized charity america condemned the gulags and work camps and yet we imprison one out of every hundred citizens; far more than stalin ever did some are killed all are dehumanized 
 as a little sci fi adventure the book isn't terrible it's really the pretension that goes along with it lowry cobbles together religious symbolism and dystopic tropes and then tries to present it as something as complex and thoughtful as the authors she copied copying isn't a crime but copying poorly is 
 like dan brown or michael crichton she creates a political pamphlet of her own ideals slaps a pretense of authority on it and then waits for the money and awards to roll in--and they did many people i've discussed this book with have pointed to those awards as the surest sign of this book's eminent worth 
 award committees are bureaucratic organizations their decisions are based on political machinations this book is a little piece of nationalism and so it was lauded by the political machine that lowry supports the left hand helps the right if awards are the surest sign of worth then titanic is a better movie than citizen kane 
 what surprises me is how many of those who brought up the award as their argument were teachers if a politically-charged administrative committee is the best way to teach children then why do you take umbrage when the principal tells you that bigger class sizes (and fewer benefits) are fine listen to him: doesn't he have award plaques 
 the other argument is usually that 'kids like it' i usually respond that kids also like candy so why not teach that some people also get angry at me for analyzing a book written for children: 
 ""of course it's not a great book it's for kids if you want a good book go read ulysses"" 
 i prefer to give children good books rather than pieces of political propaganda (even if they agreed with me) children can be as skeptical quick-witted and thoughtful as adults if you give them the chance so i see no excuse for feeding them anything less 
 kids aren't stupid they just lack knowledge and that's a fine distinction it's easy for adults to take advantage of their naivete their emotionality and their sense of worth just because it's easier for the teacher doesn't mean it's better for the child 
 when we show children something that is over-simplified presenting an idealized crudely moralizing world we aren't preparing them for the actual world if you give a child a meaningless answer to repeat he will repeat it but he won't understand why 
 why not give the child a book that presents many complex ideas but no rote answers and let them make up their own minds if they don't learn how to separate the wheat from the chaff and form their own opinions early in a safe nurturing environment what chance will they have on their own as adults 
 in all the discussions and research regarding this book i have come across very little analysis it's especially surprising for a book with such a strong following but there aren't many explanations of why the book is supposed to be useful or important 
 this lack of argument makes sense from a political standpoint since there is no reason to analyze the worth of propaganda: its worth is that it agrees with society and indoctrinates readers analyzing it would defeat the purpose; political diatribes do not stand up to thoughtful attention 
 perhaps someday someone will create a thoughtful textual analysis of this book that will point out its merits its structure and its complexity i've gradually come to doubt it i never expected when i wrote my original review of this book that it would garner this much attention 
 i still welcome comments and thoughts but if your comment looks roughly like this: 
 ""you should read this book again but this time like it more you think you're smart but you aren't you're mean lowry is great this book won awards and kids like it it's meant for kids anyways why would you analyze what its about i bet you never even read the sequels go read 'moby dick' because you are full of yourself"" 
 i've heard that one before if you do want to comment though you might check out this article; i find it helps me with presenting my ideas ""good gracious"" said alice ""i do believe i'm inside a review"" 
 she turned to the hatter and the march hare 
 ""well let me see here is the title and here is the date i read it that must be today now i need to explain the plot and the overall point"" 
 ""there is no plot"" said the march hare disagreeably 
 ""and there is no point"" agreed the hatter 
 he poured a little hot tea on the dormouse's nose making it wake with a start 
 ""the book breaks new ground"" it said rapidly in a high sing-song voice ""intentionally eluding easy assignment to any traditional category it anticipates the twentieth century's fascination with the relationship between the signifier and the signified and wittily deconstructs the primacy of meaning and the rationality of thought"" then it went back to sleep again and began to snore gently 
 ""whatever did that mean"" asked alice surprised 
 ""why is a derrida like a derriere"" replied the hatter 
 ""i don't know"" said alice 
 ""i don't know either"" said the hatter triumphantly 
 ""it would be reasonable"" said alice in the grown-up tone she had sometimes heard her sister use ""it would be reasonable for you to explain what the book is about so that i could put that in my review"" 
 ""it would be reasonable"" said the hatter ""to expect hot premarital sex in a stephenie meyer novel but don't imagine you'll find any"" 
 alice couldn't think of anything to reply to this so she turned away without another word when she was almost out of earshot she thought she heard the hatter shout something after her that might have been ""foucault"" i recently read this book to my little boy 
 it's not the first time i've read it it's probably not even the tenth time but it's the first time i've read the book in a decade and given the fact that my memory is like a cheese grater i like to think i got a pretty fresh experience 
 the result is this: i honestly don't know how i feel about this book 
 even if you haven't read the story you probably know the gist of it a tree loves a young boy and gives away pieces of itself to the boy to make the boy happy 
 on one hand this story can be taken as an open honest exhortation toward selfless agape-style love love which asks nothing love which gives everything 
 on the other hand this story can be read as a horrifying condemnation of dysfunctional unrequited co-dependance 
 after reading the book i honestly don't know which it is 
 on one hand taking this book at face value is probably a fool's game silverstein was a twisted sarcastic bastard he wrote lyrics for dr hook (most notably ""freaking at the freaker's ball"") and back in my misspent youth i discovered a poem of his in one of my dad's playboys it was called ""the great pot smoke-off"" 
 my point is dude was part of the counterculture he was full of mocking and meta and as such it seems odd that he would write something that seems like an obvious endorsement of christ-like selflessness and then that was it 
 but on the other hand when silverstein was having fun with you he usually didn't pussyfoot around one of his earliest publications was ""uncle shelby's abz book"" which *looks* like a kid's book but is clearly not: 
 here's a piece from the page on potty training: 
 ""see the potty 
 the potty is deep 
 the potty has water in the bottom 
 ""maybe someone will fall into the potty and drown 
 ""don't worry as long as you keep wetting your pants you will never drown in the potty"" 
 not a lot of ambiguity here his tongue is pretty clearly in his cheek 
 but when i read through the giving tree i don't see the author winking at me from behind the scenes the story *seems* to be straightforward 
 but here's the thing even if the story *is* straightforward i don't know how i feel about it is the boy selfish in the story absolutely he's a little shit yet he doesn't get one bit of comeuppance we kinda want him to but that's not what happens the boy doesn't seem to learn a lesson and neither does the tree 
 that seems to imply there is no lesson to be learned here 
 let's be clear the tree is *happy* at the end of the book there's no ambiguity about that it's entirely possible that the tree has acted in its own best interest it's entirely possible that the tree if you'll forgive the expression is acting according to the lethani 
 even after thinking it over for a couple days still i don't know how i feel about it that's a rarity for me 
 for that reason i'm giving this five stars if you write a book that leaves me asking questions if you write a book that people can have legitimate disagreements about if you write a book that people can still wrangle over after fifty years that's pretty clearly a five-star book there are two kinds of people in the world those who like green eggs and ham and those who don't 
 well three those who like green eggs and ham those who don't and those who like the green eggs but not the ham it's just ham not green ham we should get that straight oh correction it's green ham too 
 anyhow four kinds of people the haters the likers the green egg but not green hammers and the green hammers but not green eggs 
 actually i guess there are the people who would eat them with a fox but not in a box and some who would eat them with a fox in a box on a train but not with a goat 
 ok so there are lots of kinds of people in the world dr seuss invents diversity kudos 
 really the book is about the key existential question in the 20th and 21st centuries green food yes or no and under what conditions it's a metaphor for where a man  or woman  or thing called sam  draws the line 
 where people where will you draw that line 
 green eggs and (green) ham is a cipher for our age an antithesis to the jejune a whirlwind of growing complexity into which we pour our souls and come face to face with the naked question - will we try them try them and we may i say 
 seuss offers us a black and white and green question - do we like them but this devolves into shades of grey (green) we're crippled with choice seduced by the rhythm shocked by the goat 
 in the end my friends there are only two kinds of people those who push the 'like' button on my review of green eggs and ham and those who suck

 what a wonderful first book of the year i read this book almost too quickly i wanted it to last longer this might be technically a children's book but it really was such a special and meaningful read and i highly recommend that everyone read this once in their lives i know that many people have a sentimental love for this book and i respect that -- you can't rationalize emotional connection and generally i like this author but with this book since it inspired no real emotional response in me i am left with only the rational perspective which in me was this: 
 this book troubles me deeply because it enshrines self-destructive and self-pitying martyrdom as the paragon of love for others and i think there is already far too much of this in our society this book seems to say that if you really love someone else you will damage yourself cripple yourself tear down your boundaries destroy yourself for them and further it implies that those who are loved must by nature use and devour those who love them an incredibly unhealthy model for love and relationships especially for a child's book 
 i am a parent of two and though many parents have offered up this book as representative of the true nature of parental love i cannot agree if i were to raise my children this way i feel i would only be teaching them to take selfishly from those who love them to use people up and always expect more -- and on the flip side i would be teaching them that if they love someone then they have to give of themselves until it hurts have to live without boundaries of any kind 
 instead of raising my kids this way i feel it's important to teach them to respect those who love them and care for them to not take from others so much that it damages; i feel it's important to teach them that even in love we all must maintain our boundaries our integrity i feel it's important that my kids and all kids really understand that real healthy love does not demand destruction or diminishment of anyone involved in it that in fact real and healthy love ultimately heals and builds up those who participate in it 
 i suppose that this book may have been intended as an anti-lesson an example of how not to behave -- but if so then it was not made clear that this was the case because most people who read this book seem to take it as an ideal example of love 
 certainly it's possible to not take it so seriously; but when the underlying message and philosophy is so concentrated and heavy-handed it's hard to avoid tasting it in every passage 
 it reminds me of that other beloved childhood book about love where the young boy's mother is so obsessive about cuddling him and tucking him in at night that even as he gets older and older she follows him around sneaks into his college dorm sneaks into his home as an adult takes him from his bed with his wife still sleeping and reassures him (herself) that he'll ""always be my baby"" *shudder* 
 overall: sweet but to the point of being cloying and a disturbing message =/ tonight i just finished reading charlie and the chocolate factory with my son this is the first chapter book i've read all the way through with him and it was a ton of fun 
 first off i'll admit that i love the movie i grew up with it (i'm talking about the gene wilder version of course)i'll even admit to liking the movie better than the book which is something that doesn't happen very often with me 
 that said the book is really really good it held my four-year old's attention it's silly and it's fun 
 and it's dark 
 for those of you who haven't read the book let me underline this fact for you dahl takes pains to really detail the fact that charlie and his family aren't just hungry and poor they're destitute charlie sleeps on a mattress on the floor in the winter they are cold and they're starving to death 
 and if you think i'm exaggerating on that last point i'm not one of the chapters is titled: the family begins to starve 
 but you know what i like this book better because of that it's not sanitized pablum written by committee to be inoffensive it's the story of a little boy who is in a fucking awful situation but he is still good and kind and polite and then something really nice happens to him 
 that's a trope i can get behind 
 its it a good book to read with your kids absolutely 
 that said allow me to tangent off and share my thoughts as a total bastard: 
 if willie wonka actually hired workers and paid them a living wage maybe charlie bucket wouldn't be starving to death in the first place 
 follow me here wonka is effectively running a company where everyone is paid in scrip the oompa loompas are paid quite literally in beans beans that i'm guessing he has the oompa loompas themselves growing in some huge underground cavern 
 let's not even get into the ethical tarpit of the fact that wonka uproots an entire indigenous culture and enslaves them let's just look at this from a raw numbers point of view pure economics 
 the oompa loompas work in the factory they are not paid they never leave the factory that means they don't pay rent they don't buy groceries they don't go to the movies or take taxis or buy clothes 
 but *everyone* buys wonka's chocolate 
 that means that money goes into the factory but it doesn't come back out into the town 
 as a result the local economy is crap and it's because of this that charlie's dad can't get a decent job what's more it's because of this that his dad *loses* his shitty job and his family is starving to death 
 willie wonka isn't a childlike magic maker he's a billionaire corporate fuckwit he's the candy equivalent of monsanto there's no government oversight there osha would never have approved that bullshit boiled sweet boat and chocolate river no dude is untouchable 
 and don't tell me he isn't that shit that goes on with the other kids nobody even *thinks* of suing him none of the parents even *hint* at it he probably owns half the judges in the state and a handful of senators too 
 he's a fucking supervillian and i would paid serious money to see a story where batman kicks his ass 
 *end rant* 
 in closing let me share something that oot said while i was reading him this book: 
 ""dad willie wonka is just a regular human but he *is* a little bit of a wizard like you"" flying through this series--and the netflix show (read a book watch two episodes repeat) 
 these books are clever and dark and fun and i'm still really wishing i'd read them as kid again i am enjoying them but i know i would've loved them much more if i were within the target age range here 
 with this specific installment i was way less frustrated with the word-defining aspect but i'm starting to lose patience with mr poe i really like that the adult characters like poe and aunt josephine are flawed i think it's important for kids to know that adults aren't automatically right they can be selfish and scared and make bad decisions but come on poe he seems to be shifting from well-intentioned but kinda dumb to this patronizing antagonistic character and i'm not sure how i feel about that but we shall see 
 also one last thing that i want to briefly note -- a lot of the language describing/referring to the person ""that looks neither like a man nor woman"" had me cringing and the villainizing of gender ambiguity could be very hurtful to some readers i realize this book came out like 17 years ago but still just wanted to comment on that i think that the failure not only of children's literature as a whole but of our very concept of children and the child's mind is that we think it a crime to challenge and confront that mind children are first protected from their culture--kept remote and safe--and then they are thrust incongruously into a world that they have been told is unsafe and unsavory; and we expected them not to blanch 
 it has been my policy that the best literature for children is not a trifling thing not a simplification of the adult or a sillier take on the world good children's literature is some of the most difficult literature to write because one must challenge engage please and awe a mind without resorting to archetypes or life experience 
 once a body grows old enough we are all saddened by the thought of a breakup we have a set of knowledge and memories the pain returns to the surface children are not born with these understandings so to make them understand pain fear and loss is no trivial thing the education of children is the transformation of an erratic and hedonistic little beast into a creature with a rational method by which to judge the world 
 a child must be taught not to fear monsters but to fear instead electrical outlets pink slips poor people and lack of social acceptance the former is frightening in and of itself the latter for complex internal reasons i think the real reason that culture often fears sexuality and violence in children is because they are such natural urges we fear to trigger them because we cannot control the little beasts we cannot watch them every minute 
 so to write children's literature an author must create something complex and challenging something that the child can turn over in their mind without accidentally revealing some terrible aspect of the world that the child is not yet capable of dealing with carroll did this by basing his fantasies off of complex impersonal structures: linguistics and mathematical theory these things have all the ambiguity uncertainty and structure of the grown-up world without the messy human parts 
 this is also why the alice stories fulfill another requirement i have for children's lit: that it be just as intriguing and rewarding for adults there is no need to limit the depth in books for children because each reader will come away with whatever they are capable of finding fill an attic with treasures and the child who enters it may find any number of things--put a single coin in a room and you ensure that the child will find it but nothing more 
 of course we must remember that nothing we can write will ever be more strange or disturbing to a child than the pure unadulterated world that we will always have failed to prepare them for however perhaps we can fail a little less and give them alice not all outlets are to be feared despite what your parents taught you in fact some should be prodded with regularity and if you dare not a little joy i'm beginning to wonder if there will ever be a defence against the dark arts teacher who is just a teacher it feels odd to mark this book as anything less than five stars it was a huge part of my childhood 
 what's more this book is part of the reason i'm a decent public speaker these days i joined forensics because this was the book that was being used for extemporaneous reading (i didn't even know what forensics was when i started just that i liked the book) 
 and there are things i like here good things it's a fun adventure story there are cool settings action tension the different nature of the islands is cool there's mystery magic wonder the character of reepicheep alone boosts this book by a full star 
 the character of eustace is better than i remember him being too it's nice to see a kid who is a total dick learn that there's consequences to his actions then have a redemption arc in a kid's book 
 but reading this book to my little boy made me confront a lot of the problems in the book there are slavers in the early chapters which is something i didn't remember and a topic i wasn't sure i wanted to introduce to my kid at the age of 6 
 there's a fair chunk of sexism too little things scattered throughout the books not terrible considering when it was written but still nothing i want soaking into my kid's psyche the best example of this is ramandu's daughter caspian meets her and it becomes obvious that they're going to get married 
 let's just pass lightly over the fact that she's effectively being treated like a prize for him completing his quest and jump right into the fact that she doesn't have a name she's referred to as ""ramandu's daughter"" through the entire book despite the fact that she has a larger part in the book 
 that's fucked up y'all 
 there's narrative issues too the children rarely solve their own problems several times they're confronted by bad situations or make bad choices but then instead of having to deal with the consequences or figure out solutions aslan shows up and is all tth_tth then under the weight of his disappointed dad eyes and they're filled with shame and realize they should stop being dicks that's not good storytelling that's some deus ex leo bullshit 
 it's a good book and i'm fond of it but it's not perfect and its flaws are large enough that they bear some serious consideration before you put it in front of your kids these are fast reads and i'm really invested in the overarching story but i know i would've liked these so much more as a kid as an adult they're enjoyable--they're darker than expected and there's enough cleverness throughout to keep me engaged but i'm finding myself frustrated with some aspects like the communication failures between the kids and the adults and the constant defining of words which is sometimes really fun but at other times just feels patronizing 
 overall though i am enjoying these i'm definitely hooked into the story and i already care way too much about the fate of the orphans so i will continue reading my way through this series *reread july 2017* 
 reread this for booktube-a-thon 2017 just because i was falling behind obviously i loved it (again) 
 *reread january 2016* 
 read for the school this time and i read the puffin in bloom edition i loved the new illustrations his parents did well naming him shel 
 he never did care to conform 
 what would compel a guy to rebel 
 if everyone knew him as norm i don't give a fig if it is a kid's book charlotte's web is one of the most well-crafted stories ever written this classic children's tale deserves 5 stars for story craft and language usage alone (read your strunk & white to understand this man's talents in that regard) the fact that it's a heart-warmer/wrencher clinches it never was i made to love pigs and spiders so much in my life charlotte's web will always rank high amongst my favorites but why for the love of god did they make us watch the cartoon version of this tear-jerker in school did they want to make us weep embarrassingly in front of one another if so mission accomplished you sadistic school district shark week starts today prepare for shark floats rarrrrrrrrr 
 january project = complete 
 feverish jaws-applause 
 this is my january review-project so it's gonna resurface throughout the month as i work my way through the book 
 okay so this is what has happened so far 
 first of all i am using my shark pencils to draw sharks because i'm told that is how famous artists do it 
 then i enlisted the help of sean of the house because he is good at drawing and i have never used a drawing book before (because i am a natural) and even though there were instructions at the beginning of the book (that suggest you begin by tracing the examples) i was confused by ""why do i have to draw lines i'm just gonna erase and why do i have to jam a bunch of shapes together instead of just drawing a shape like a shark"" 
 and sean was all ""plumb lines"" and ""negative space"" and goya quotes and i'm like mmmm frijoles because like a shark i am impatient and bad at listening and hungry and needing to be on the move gnash gnash gnash 
 so finally i just said drawing time now and i drew a really chubby shark 
 great white shark 
 and then i drew a somewhat better shark 
 and now it is time for shark number two 
 great white shark 
 i'm not sure i even like the way sharks look in this book - they seem to have too many extraneous lines why so many chins shark but whatever i drew it anyway: 
 and then i colored it in all fancy: 
 i have decided to do just one ""take"" for all these sharks i figure if i can't get it right on the first attempt i don't deserve to be a shark sketch artist and from here on out i'm not gonna give away any more farms i'll post the book's finished sharks but not the steps on how to get there that way you can judge my ability to follow directions but still hafta buy the book yourself to show off how much better than me you are at things 
 hammerhead shark 
 can you even tell which is mine and which is from the book hint - i am a girl 
 mako shark 
 my mako shark is not the sharpest fin in the ocean but he means well derrrrrr 
 whale shark 
 i don't understand the mouth i just draw it 
 basking shark 
 let's hope a basking shark never commits a crime because it would totally get away with it if the shark police were relying on my drawings to apprehend the culprit 
 nurse shark 
 my nurse shark is also a vampire and a civil war enthusiast 
 thresher shark 
 this shark is angry about the state of that modesty-fin by his genitals ""what have you done to me karen"" he wails 
 tiger shark 
 i've been taking some liberties with color it wasn't until after i'd finished this one that i realized i'd been channelling he-man's cat cringer: 
 zebra shark 
 a pox on thee zebra shark 
 blue shark 
 the blue shark is a terrible snob 
 crested bullhead shark 
 thank god there are other fish in the sea because this fish sucks 
 bull shark 
 i don't think i am going to be able to fit all these sharks in the review space so many more to come 
 frilled shark 
 a regrettable frankenshark can't win 'em all 
 goblin shark 
 okay this is the weirdest shark in the book true the goblin shark is already crazy-looking: 
 but this drawing looks more like riff raff than a goblin shark 
 and i am now pleased to respond to a special request and present the goblin king shark: 
 which i am further pleased to note fortuitously replicates the goblin king bulge 
 saw shark 
 saw shark smash 
 wobbegong (carpet) shark 
 wobbegonggg 
 leopard shark 
 so many triangles 
 megamouth shark 
 i feel a certain kinship to this one we are bellowing buddies 
 prickly dogfish shark 
 this shark lives in fear of being flushed down the toilet when he dies 
 bamboo shark 
 now there's your tim burton shark erma and there's my chubby version of it my sharks have always just come from a very satisfying meal 
 sawback angel shark 
 this one required me to draw a square no one said there would be squares 
 cookiecutter shark 
 the cookiecutter shark wears lipstick to draw attention away from her freakish external vagina 
 blacktip reef shark 
 looks like some little shark got his fingies into the jam pot 
 sand tiger shark 
 poor sand tiger shark has clearly been dropped on the floor and glued back together all wrong 
 copper shark 
 am i just being shark-racist or are all these sharks starting to look the same 
 velvet belly lantern shark 
 what is it with this guy and shark crotch-bulge 
 porbeagle shark 
 phew - photobucket is back up again (knock wood) was that worth waiting for i feel like maybe it wasn't i'm supposed to be getting better at this not worse maybe photobucket was doing me a favor being down all day 
 spinner shark 
 wheeee the dance of the penultimate shark tomorrow's the last day guys snif 
 australian ghost shark 
 oh no a ghost shark with - yes - a weird bulge going on back there the perfect finale to my journey 
 so that's the end of the january project folks i have drawn all the sharks there are in the world feel free to praise/mock/rank my sharks or get them tattooed on your body 
 just not on your bulge 
 my very own ocean 
 of course before i was able to photograph this colorful school of sharks the most apex predator of them all wandered into frame 
 made herself comfortable 
 and ate a few sharks rip bull shark 
 see you in february

  shrbyny i know this is a classic and all but i had a hard time making it through this book it's full of needless repetition which makes it longer than it needs to be what's more the plot is a mess leaping from event to event almost randomly at times 
 i respect what the author is attempting to do here thematically eastman is asking bold questions about how things are related to one another are we a green dog or a yellow one is it day or night these are big questions and they need to be asked 
 that said you can have a book that contains big ideas and an interesting story too and unfortunately the story is severely lacking here 
 the one saving grace of the book was the ""do you like my hat"" subplot which was very tight in its execution and satisfying in its resolution 
 ultimately when reading a book like this the question you have to ask yourself is ""would i buy the sequel"" and i have to say with some regret that i wouldn't there were just too many structural problems with the story for that 
 * * * 
 seriously though i had a great time reading this book with my little boy lots of basic words used in different situations make it a great tool if i was still teaching esl students i would use this to clue in struggling students about prepositions (if you think prepositions are easy it's only because you're a native speaker try explaining to someone from japan why you get *in* a car but *on* a train) 
 as a bonus this book is long most kids books seem to be about 20 pages these days but this is pretty easily triple that it makes it less of a mind-numbing experience when you end up reading it a couple times 
 ps i meant what i said about the hat subplot genius a young boy is awakened from his christmas eve rest by a train that magically appears just outside his home ignoring the demands of stranger-danger the boy climbs aboard finding the car filled with other youngsters they are treated to goodies while en route to the north pole where santa is to offer the first gift of christmas to one of the passengers in a town-square ceremony attended by all the elves as well as the transported youngsters our hero is selected and when asked what he would like opts for a single bell from santa's sleigh 
 i knew that i could have any gift i could imagine but the thing i wanted most for christmas was not inside santa's giant bag what i wanted more than anything was one silver bell from santa's sleigh when i asked santa smiled then he gave me a hug and told an elf to cut a bell from a reindeer's harness the elf tossed it up to santa he stood holding the bell high above him and called out ""the first gift of christmas"" 
 this is one of the all time great magical stories with stunning illustrations i read this to my kids every year on christmas eve since the late 1980s while they have long outgrown that tradition on the odd occasions when i pick it up again it never fails to bring tears to my eyes the illustrations are incredible and the message of youthful hope symbolized by the bell resonates 
 when they char my final remains this is one of the books i want to go into the ashes with me a review by my 9 y-o son described by the utterly lovely neil gaiman as the 'best review ever': 
 today i was sick my mum doesnaeur(tm)t always believe me when i say iaeur(tm)m sick but my sister was sick yesterday so mum said i could stay off school aeur~butaeur(tm) she said aeur~donaeur(tm)t think youaeur(tm)re going to be lazing around watching tv and playing on the computer all dayaeur(tm) 
 that was bad news that is indeed what i was planning on doing :( 
 i was bored so mum let me borrow her kindle to read a book that was making her laugh called aeur~fortunately the milkaeur|aeur(tm) by neil gaiman with illustrations by chris riddell i noticed that it had brilliant pictures in it aeur"" even on the kindle aeur"" and mum said i could go on the ipad if i wanted to draw a front cover for the book i did lookaeur| 
 (you can see the images at: http://book-walruscom/book-review-fo) 
 there was something very good about this book it was an aeur~enhanced editionaeur(tm) which means that the writer reads the book out loud to you while you read it this writer is a good reader and he didnaeur(tm)t sound at all like the dalek voice that normally comes out of the kindle mum said i could stay on the ipad if i wanted to draw a picture of the writer reading the book but i canaeur(tm)t draw good faces so i drew a picture of the kindle talking then i labeled it aeur~kindleaeur(tm) because mum asked what it was 
 (you can see the images at: http://book-walruscom/book-review-fo) 
 i started to read this is me reading and no my face is not the book 
 (you can see the images at: http://book-walruscom/book-review-fo) 
 everyone should read this book it will make everybody laugh it is good and very clever the best thing is that it goes backwards and forwards in time with the dad meeting himself all over the place in the past and in the future and in crazy wormholes 
 (you can see the images at: http://book-walruscom/book-review-fo) 
 it has good characters the dad is a funny dad i also like the brother and sister because they are not stupid they ask the dad clever questions to try and trap him but he is good at wiggling out of trouble 
 i think this is a very good book and it deserves 5 stars which i have drawn here (because it meant i could stay on the ipad for longer :) ) 
 (you can see the images at: http://book-walruscom/book-review-fo 
 one day i would like to write books as good as aeur~fortunately the milkaeur|aeur(tm) and draw pictures as good as this too 45* 
 this was so much fun such a quick and engaging read i loved how all the fairy tales i know and love were incorporated into the story i actually listened to the audiobook which is read by chris colfer and it really enhanced my reading experience 
 i will admit i found the writing at times to be a tad lackluster but that was mostly a problem with showing vs telling that i think can be attributed to the fact that it's a middle grade novel i think this is a series i will definitely be continuing today my son caught my eye then pointed conspiratorially to his sweat pants then he pointed to his shirt 
 it took me a moment to realize that he was wearing all his clothes inside out because that's one of the ways you keep yourself safe from faerie magic 
 so yeah it think it's safe to say that these books have had an impact on him lol 1st book for the booktube-a-thon complete 2nd book complete still five stars love this so much can't review couldn't even take notes watched the movie immediately after finishing need next book wish i lived in this world damn you rowling ** spoiler alert ** 
 if there are no wrong answers can we really say that something has any meaning 
 it is very easy to start an interesting science fiction story simply begin with a mystery don't explain things to the reader and leave them in a state of wonder in this way everything will seem interesting intriguing and worth exploring tap into the reader's powers of imagination and allow them to make your story interesting in ways you need not imagine and perhaps cannot create this is a good plan for starting a science fiction story lots of science fiction stories begin in this way on television almost all of them do - 'x-files' 'lost' 'battlestar galactica' 'the 4400' 'the truth is out there' 'they have a plan' 
 'the giver' starts in this way in the first few pages as the setting unfolded i was struck by the parallels to china after the cultural revolution - the bicycles the uniform-like clothing the regulated life the shame based culture and 'the sameness' i also thought of china because i immediately grasped that this had to be a culture which was designed to gently crash its population there were many clues that the world was heavily overpopulated and the primary goal of the culture so described was to crash the population without descending into society destroying anarchy - the highly regulated birthrate which was insufficient to sustain the population to sustain the population more than 17 out of each 25 females would have to be assigned to be birth mothers and this clearly wasn't the case the replacement rate for a society is about 23 live births per female (maybe 21 in a society that is safe and careful) - clearly they were implied to be below this ratio so clearly this was a society that was trying to shed population 
 equally clearly this was a society that engaged in widespread euthanasia for the most trivial of causes which hints at a culture which doesn't value life because people are in such abundance that they can be readily disposed of i suspected that 'release' was euthanasia almost immediately from the context in which it was introduced and this was almost immediately confirmed when it was revealed that infants were subject to 'release' clearly infants can't be meaningfully banished so clearly release was euthanasia so i was intrigued by the story i wanted to see what happened to jonas and his naive family who had so poised themselves on the edge of a great family wrecking tragedy in just the first few dozen pages of the story i wanted to receive from the storyteller answers to the questions that the story was poising if not some great profound message then at least some story that followed from what she began 
 but it was not to be the first clue that the whole construct was to eventually come crashing down was that jonas clearly didn't understand 'release' to mean 'euthanasia' nor in fact did anyone seem to know what 'release' meant this shocked me because in the context of the setting it was virtually impossible that he and everyone else did not know i could very easily imagine a stable society where human life was not prized - after all societies that believe that human life is intrinsically valuable are historically far less common than ones that don't we know that the society is life affirming both because we are told how pained and shocked they are by loss and by the fact that jonas responds to scenes of death with pity and anger what i could not believe in was a society which held the concept of 'precision of language' so tightly and so centrally that the protagonist could not imagine lying could in fact be founded on lies that's impossible no society like that can long endure some technological explanation would be required to explain how the society managed to hide the truth from itself if release took place in some conscious state of mind then surely the dispensers of justice the nurturers the caregivers and the sanitation workers would all know the lie and all suspect - as jonas did - that they were being lied to as well surely all of these would suspect what their own future release would actually entail and surely at least some of them would reject it surely some not inconsequential number of new children reared to value precision of language and to affirm the value of life would rebel at the audacity of the lie if nothing else even in a society that knew nothing of love even if only the society had as much feeling as the members of the family displayed and even if people only valued others as much as the community was shown to value others surely some level of attachment would exist between people soma or not the seeds of pain tragedy conflict and rebellion are present if ever the truth is known to anyone 
 nothing about the story makes any sense none of it bears any amount of scrutiny at all the more seriously you consider it the more stupid and illogical the whole thing becomes we are given to believe that the society has no conception of warfare to the point that it cannot recognize a child's war game for what it is and yet we are also given to believe that they train pilots in flying what is implied to be a fighter craft and that the community maintains anti-aircraft weapons on a state of high alert such that they could shoot down such a fighter craft on a moments notice we are given to believe that all wild animals are unknown to the community yet we are also given to believe that potential pest species like squirrels and birds are not in fact extinct how do you possibly keep them out of the community if they exist in any numbers elsewhere we are given to believe that technology exists sufficient to fill in the oceans and control the weather and replace the natural biosphere with something capable of sustaining humanity but that technological innovation continues in primitive culture we are given to believe that they are worried about overpopulation and starvation and yet also that most of the world is empty and uninhabited or that this inherently xenophobic community lives in isolation if in fact it doesn't span the whole of the earth we are given to believe that this is a fully industrial society yet the community at most has a few thousands of people surely thousands of such communities must exist to maintain an aerospace industry to say nothing of weather controllers why is no thought given to the hundreds of other receivers of memory which must exist in their own small circles of communities in the larger community surely any plan which ignores the small communities place in the larger is foredoomed to failure surely the receiver of memory knows what a purge or a pogrom is 
 how are we to believe that jonas's father whose compassion for little gabriel is so great that he risks breaking the rules for his sake whose compassion for little gabriel is so great that he risks face by going to the committee to plead for gabriel's life whose compassion for little gabriel is so great that he discomforts himself and his whole family for a year for the sake of the child is the same man who so easily abandons that same child at a single setback when he has witnessed the child grow and prosper doesn't it seem far easier to believe that this same man who is openly scornful of the skills and nurturing ability of the night crew would more readily blame the night crew for gabriel's discomfort i can only conclude just as i can only conclude about the illogical fact that no one knows what release is that everything is plastic within the dictates of the plot jonas's father feels and acts one way when the needs of the plot require it and feels and acts in different ways when the needs of the plot require something else what i can't believe is that this is any sort of whole and internally consistent character or setting every single thing when held up to the light falls apart there is not one page which is even as substantial as tissue paper 
 it is almost impossible to draw meaning from nonsense so it is no wonder that people have wondered at the ending what happens the great virtue of the story as far as modern educators are probably concerned is that there are no wrong answers what ever you wish to imagine is true is every bit as good of answer as any other perhaps he lives perhaps he finds a community which lives in the old ways knowing choice - and war and conflict (which probably explains why the community needs anti-aircraft defenses) but more likely from the context he dies perhaps he is delusional perhaps he gets to the bottom and lies down in the deepening snow which the runners can no longer be pushed through and he dies perhaps he dies and goes to heaven maybe even the heaven of the one whose birthday is celebrated by the implied holiday perhaps it is even the case that he was sent to his death by the cynical giver who knew his death was necessary to release the memories he contained by to the community perhaps he didn't just die but was slaughtered as the sacrificial lamb - killed by a murderous lie from the one he trusted too well for my entry in the meaningless answers contest i propose that the whole thing was just a dream this seems the easiest way to explain the contradictions a dream doesn't have to make sense and the biggest clue that it is a dream is of course that jonas sees the world in black and white with only the occasional flashes of recognized color around important colorful things as is typical of that sort of black and white dream perhaps jonas will wake up and engage in dream sharing with his family and they will laugh at the silliness and then go to the ceremony of twelves or perhaps the whole community is only a dream and jonas will wake up and go downstairs and open his christmas presents with his family a fan gave this to me as a gift at nerdcon this past weekend i didn't know it existed until then 
 apparently it's based off a jonathan coulton song but despite the fact that i'm a coulton fan i'd never heard it still i wasn't terribly surprised i tend to live under a heavy rock most of the time 
 despite not knowing the song it was based on i loved the book i read it in a restaurant the day after the convention and got all teary i tried to cover this up by pretending that i was really emotionally involved in my cobb salad but i don't think it worked 
 it's a really great book and when i got done i read it to my two little boys (and got teary again) they loved it and wanted to hear it a second time 
 so i read it to them again 
 * * * 
 update: tonight (one day after our initial reading) i found my older boy (6) reading this book to himself then my littlest boy (2) carried it over to me and said ""read daddy read daddy read""

 when i first saw this book advertised at bea i did an anticipation-dance while drooling over that cover it was a very messy dance like a drunken sprinkler and i guess it dizzied me into thinking this was a picture book i couldn't wait to get my hands on it and the day it came out i barreled straight over to the kids department and after rerouting myself from the picture book section i grabbed a copy and had to pause for confusion words why so many words 
 there are actually very few pictures in here and there isn't even a fox in all of them which was kind of disappointing at first but then i read it and there was no more disappointment okay there was significantly less disappointment 
 this is a powerful story; it's harsh but it's honest 
 it's war and nature and violence and death and love and duty and loyalty and sacrifice which to be fair would have been a lot for a picture book to take on but the heart wants what the heart wants 
 there are some middle grade books that you read when you're a kid that are totally disposable; just reading for reading's sake and you forget all about 'em ten minutes after they're done but then there are some that are a little more challenging that inspire complicated emotions lasting well into adulthood for me it was island of the blue dolphins where the red fern grows the trumpet of the swan the incredible journey etc and i just know that if i were a wee young'un today this would also become one of those books for me 
 it's a lovely story about a boy and his pet fox separated by war and their struggle to reunite it's tender and sad and fervent emotional stuff i didn't cry because that's a rare and beautiful thing but i got one of those lumps in my throat that was either temporary cancer or feelings 
 my roaring about the ending of the book was written immediately after finishing it and now that i have had a little bit of time to process it i am somewhat less reactionary the ending itself is fine - fair and reasonable and not dissimilar to many other books/films of its kind is it what i wanted to happen no but i also didn't want andie to end up with blaine because duh 
 but i do feel left in limbo - there are a couple of hanging chads bugging me and preventing me from a full-on embrace of the story i understand with my logic-brain that it's more effective to have the book end where it did in full emotional flower of instead of having a ""time passes"" epilogue or something but it does give me a little resolution-agita 
 ending the book there is kind of unfair to the vola storyline peter spends most of the book under her care they change each other for the better but then he takes leave of her so abruptly neither of them is given emotional closure obviously peter is in a hurry to find pax - that's been his goal the whole book long and time is of the essence but by not returning to her in some way at the end; whether it be stated or implicit it feels ungrateful of peter and shortsighted of the author in not giving them a less rushed farewell or one where there is a more explicit acknowledgment of their paths crossing again in the future 
 the same goes for peter and his father - there's no sense of how what peter has gone through and the strength and control he now knows himself to have will affect his relationship with his father in the future peter has grown into a more confident person who no longer worries about inheriting his father's violence but how will this ""new"" peter coexist with his father what will their relationship become they don't get a real confrontation scene which seems odd and i don't really understand peter's father as a character he's severe in his grief and physically aggressive yet he's charmed by pax's appearance in the tent so he's not irredeemably evil but the scene where the therapist comes to the house is hard to reconcile or explain i'm not sure what he was so angry about there or what he is to this book other than ""what peter does not want to become"" 
 i'm not sure what peter's life will be without pax pax is going to be fine - he has an instant new family to fill the hole peter leaves behind peter has just had loss (mother) followed by loss (vola) followed by loss (pax) and now he's left with just his father and this war that's going to break at amy minute 
 and what is this war even 
 by choosing to focus on only the micro - the reunion however brief between pax and peter it undermines the seriousness of this war; after we have been told to ""tell the truth about war"" and have actually seen the ""truth"" of it as enacted upon the animals if not the human loss the war is unresolved unexplained and mostly just serving as a threat - ominously painting the story's background with its irrevocable approach only to be supplanted by a goodbye scene and left  still coming 
 so yeah -it seems i do still have a problem with the way the ending was handled but i'm not gonna let that ruin my day or the five-star feel of this book in my heart 
 the heart wants what the heart wants and the heart is also able to overlook as many flaws as it has to if there are enough strong positive feelings inside 
 ********************************************** 
 my copy is defective different ending please 
 review to come regardless of this fact my impressions in a single word: meh 
 i recently read this to my little boy and i have to admit i really didn't care for it 
 don't get me wrong it's not a *terrible* book there's nothing hideously wrong with it (see my review of esio trot if you want to see me go off on a dahl book i hated) 
 but there wasn't much right with it either the simple fact was mr fox was not in fact very fantastic 
 the plot centers around some farmers that try to kill mr fox they try to dig him out of his hole fox's clever solution dig down so they can't reach him 
 but then the farmers dig *faster* 
 fox's clever solution they should dig away faster 
 eventually they try to starve mr fox and his family out of the hole 
 fox's clever solution dig even farther and steal some food 
 and that's pretty much the whole book (spoiler alert) 
 i like my books to have some cleverness in them if you have a book where the main character is a fox and people are going to praise him for being fantastic he better y'know do something if not fantastic then at least interesting 
 if your clever solution to *every* problem is ""dig more"" you're kinda just phoning it in 
 also some mild sexism in here nothing horrifying like in esio trot but why read a meh book with mild sexism to your kids there's better stuff out there much better years before i had kids i taught a class on children's literature in preparation for that class i went out and bought copies of every dr seuss book ever written 
 since then a decade has passed i've had kids and read many seuss books to both of them many many times 
 so imagine my surprise when i was looking through our bookshelves today and there among all the seuss i saw this: a seuss book i don't remember *ever* reading 
 so i pulled it down and started reading it to my youngest boy cutie (not his real name he's a little under 2) 
 the first thing that struck me as odd was the art it looked similar to seuss but it was flatter cleaner the lines were straight and precise i shrugged it off thinking to myself that maybe it was one of his later books and his style was more polished then or maybe he was trying something new 
 but as i kept reading the words weren't right either rhyme and meter as flawless as seuss's are delightfully easy to read but they are a nightmare to write i know and while some pages were fine solid others were just odd they had bad lines in the middle of good lines the number of syllables would change randomly from stanza to stanza or things would stop rhyming entirely 
 about five or six pages in i actually closed the book to look at the cover to see if it really said ""by dr seuss"" or if i'd been tricked by one of those goddamn abhorrences in book form that pretends to a book by a certain author but really it's ""based on"" the the author's work or ""inspired by"" the work that is bullshit behavior 
 but no it said ""by dr seuss"" right on the cover 
 so i kept reading it cutie liked it well enough but then again it's not that hard to impress a 20 month old 
 it got worse and worse as i continued and after i finished it i did a little research and found out that this book was published several years after his death it was discovered as a draft in 1994 it was doubtless finished by someone else and the art was done by someone else ""based on some of the sketches discovered with his draft"" 
 so simply said this is only ""by dr seuss"" in the very roughest sense 
 here are my problems with the book: 
 1 the language is bad the rhyme meter and word choice are neither consistent nor good i could probably go through this book and highlight the parts that seuss actually wrote 
 if this weren't posing as a seuss book this would be less of an issue but seuss was a master of the language to present this is as seuss though it's like going into a restaurant and ordering a bowl of soup and getting a bowel of soap instead close but no it's not really close at all is it 
 2 the art isn't the same it's similar in style but really not the same in terms of feel 
 3 the message/moral/plot is strange/confusing/messy/nonexistent 
 so is this book painful is it like eating broken glass or having a nail driven into your eye no not really and honestly if it was just a random kid's book it would rank a solid 'meh' from me maybe a meh-minus 
 but this isn't being pitched as a random kid's book it's supposed to be dr seuss and this isn't it *very* isn't and reading it is like picking up your glass expecting a mouthful of orange juice and instead getting milk or a bowel of soap not what you signed up for *and* startlingly unpleasant 
 so yeah don't squander your money on nostalgia like this you're much better off re-reading a different seuss or if you're looking for something new then try out a new kid's book by a struggling new author that way at least you have the chance of finding a new favorite here all you're going to find is the sad dim room empty except for a worn chair where a great man used to sit just got my copy heck yes i'll definitely start this soon woah i can easily understand why such a grand amount of people loved this book and definitely see why many were not satisfied with the movie i cannot believe how many elements of this story they changed however there is something that i must admit: i preferred the movie because of how melancholic and hopeful it made me feel and for the suspense inside it that the book irrevocably lacked it is not something that i hear myself say often at all i have always been that little full of criticism girl who could not help but compare books to movies and movies to books quite a negative experience i tend to have with the latter i mean red riding hood (trailer) starring amanda seyfried was enticing reading the film-to-novel adaptation though felt like walking through mud - tiring boring and endless why i granted it a three star rating is beyond me 
 let's just put that aside though after all it is of the giver that i shall talk about and my time spent reading the story was definitely not wasted - hence the four star rating - even if not what i anticipated first the hero was very young a detail that i seemed to have forgotten before starting this read not a problem though for jonas showed an impressive and admirable maturity in his character even i at twelve and others around me at that time were not as reflective wise andintelligent sure math held no secrets from me but i was not actually resolving problems for the greater good or aware of the true face of the world as opposite as the situation and context definitely were the fact remains that jonas lead this story with greatness and along the way opened my eyes to some beautiful themes 
 it shook me to witness how unimportant fiona appeared and how no chemistry was palpable between jonas and her apparently they were friends through ashen mostly or at least that is what i deducted of course they volunteered together but it is not as if they talked and shared moments like true friends normally do plus we could barely see her because of how her presence was omitted ashen was definitely endearing in this while in the cinematographic adaptation - i apologies for bringing it up again - i growled at him continuously 
 this was another example of a book with fine simplistic writing my first one i believe was aristotle and dante discover the secrets of the universe then i discovered some others and familiarized myself with this type of writing i am completely in favour of it since it can bring such a peaceful atmosphere to stories and make the reader easily understand every detail written however there is something that i unluckily often stumble upon when this style is present and this was no exception: repetition but maybe it is easier to distinguish it since everything in the writing is clearer 
 even though i brought up an equal - or so it seems - amount of positive and negative elements for the giver i must let you know that the negative ones never bothered annoyed or frustrated me they were there and i was aware of them but never let any of those weaknesses keep me from enjoying my read because i did so much 
 ps for a couple of minutes i thought that i just read one of the first dystopian books ever written but this list proved me the contrary it was a rainy morning and i felt like reading neil's new book 'fortunately the milk' so i popped on my favourite astronaut t-shirt and caught the bus to my local bookstore snuffin and kooks i looked high and low for neil's book but all that was there were stacks of paranormal romance as far as i could see 
 ""excuse me"" i said to the nearest droopy-eyed sales attendant ""do you have neil gaiman's new book 'fortunately the milk'"" 
 she rolled her eyes so far back that i thought for a moment she was inspecting her own sinus cavities ""all the hipsters have already bought out our entire stock"" she replied 
 ""but how could they don't they know that i have been a fan of his since the sandman days before he was ""cool""' 
 she gave two ineffectual chews of something ""so you are one of those hipsters"" 
 i left in a huff and a grumble mumbling things about prescription lenses and vampire weekend being a good band anyway 
 i returned to the bus-stop which which was covered unfortunately the covering did not seem to be designed to keep the rain off rather to concentrate the droplets and deposit them upon the head of a waiting passenger i was soon joined by another hopeful passenger an old lady who smelt of wet cardboard and boiled sweets 
 ""you look down dearie"" she said and i explained my predicament to her ""well i know of a place that sells books i bet they'll have that neil armstrong book of yours it's a cafe down the main street there and you go left down the lane with the shoe store on the corner and it's halfway along on the left"" 
 despite knowing that a cafe that sells books would never sell the books i like i decided to investigate due to my boredom and to make an old lady happy i knew the shoe store but not the lane i thought it was next to the kebab shop that was quite obviously a front to an underground bikram yoga class but as i arrived i saw that there was indeed a lane between the two and it had a sign stating that it was ""aquap lane"" it was there that i slipped in the wet and thought that this was too harry potter for my liking 
 when i came to i was in a dark space with a shrunken man looking a me while holding a candlestick wee willy winkie style 
 ""where am i"" i asked the small man 
 ""you're in a pocket dimension how did you get here i don't want them in here"" he spat at me 
 ""i was looking for a book neil gaiman's new book"" 
 ""is it paperback or hardcover cos you'll only find paperbacks in a pocket dimension god what do they teach you kids these days"" 
 ""calculus but why do you call this place a pocket dimension"" i asked 
 ""because you see it is a dimension that could fit in your pocket it's essentially a pocket-sized dimension it is"" he explained with a smirk on his face 
 fortunately this smirk had a half-life of about one and a half seconds the loss of smirk corresponded to the rise in volume of clanking footfalls 
 ""oh you did it didn't you you've gone and bought them well you'll not get that neal's book from here"" he scorned 
 ""no it's a neil book not a neal book"" i yelled as a group of knights in armour clanked out of the darkness and seized the shrunken man and i 
 ""well you'd want a briefcase dimension for that kind of thing not a pocket dimension but i guess it's too late now"" 
 by torchlight (the ye olde stinky fat-covered fire sticks not the battery powered ones they're knights dammit) we were led into the inky darkness of the pocket dimension we walked for what may be days but it felt like minutes wait is that the right way around well i guess that a pocket dimension has timey-wimey issues 
 eventually we emerged through an archway into the light of day it was a garden a very intricate garden with topiary animals and paths of white gravel oh no i thought an alice in wonderland pastiche by a person who has never read the book and only seen the disney film but hang on how did i know that having only seen the film and never read the book 
 ""off with his head"" 
 oh great it get's more cliched 
 ""but can i plead my case your majesty""i asked ""i do not know why i am here and what i have been accused of and by the way i thought you were meant to be a queen"" 
 ""well as you can see i am a king clever isn't it no not really anyhoo you stand accused of writing an overly long pastiche review that by now no one is reading nobody has even chuckled at and now you are destroying the fourth wall or is it the fifth i've never been one for architecture"" 
 ""guilty as charged your highness"" i confessed ""i thought everyone would like it and think i was clever but i guess all it has ended up being is a waste of a morning when i have more productive things to do i could have gone to the bookstore instead hang on that was in the review universe not the real universe now things are getting silly"" 
 ""indeed"" confirmed the king ""and therefore i sentence you to finish this atrocity of a review as soon as possible without using the waking up from a dream scenario i hate when they do that"" 
 ""well it would expedite this review if you had a copy of neil gaiman's new book 'fortunately the milk' that i could read very quickly that would be mighty helpful your highness"" 
 ""luckily i have a copy right here in my ermine cape i was reading it earlier and i found it a quite fine read i did not like the ending though who'd have thought that all that time the milk was the murderer not the train driver absurd"" 
 ""well no need to read it now thanks anyway"" with all the garbage going on in my life right now i forgot that it was dinovember time to catch up 
 another item to add to the list of ""ways in which i was failed as a child"" 
 1) not born a redheaded princess 
 2) no pony not even one 
 3) made to eat canned green beans seriously - i know it was the 70's but come on we had a garden 
 4) never once woke up to a tableau of dinosaurs behaving badly complete with smashed dishes and dino-graffiti all over the walls 
 because the four children belonging to the authors of this book get to wake up to such tableaux thirty days out of each year and probably have never even heard of canned green beans 
 this book is i think a book of professionally-photographed reenactments of previous dinovembers judging by the impeccable lighting and staging compared against the images available on their own internet places like here and here and also the fact that so many of these pictures seem to be catching the dinosaurs in the midst of their tomfoolery rather than a scene being discovered the morning after by lucky cherished children 
 for example detective karen notes that this sink hasn't overflowed and the bubbles are still fresh and frothy 
 and this popcorn in still in midair: 
 which reminds me - so very many of these stagings involve butter so much butter wasted but also - not smooshy as it would have been after several hours 
 and whatever is happening here definitely hasn't been there for too long 
 i don't even know where you get enough ice to do that let alone thinking you can fool the reader of this book into believing this was a stage set and left for the kids to find in the morning a kid looks at that picture and thinks ""fun"" a grown-up looks at it and thinks ""who is going to pay that bill"" thankfully ""fun"" was my first thought so i'm not quite grown yet 
 and while it must be so magical to wake up to mischievous dinosaurs every morning for a month (although i have no way of knowing for sure because of how shamefully i was deprived of dinosaur stagings) i have a couple of reservations about the irresponsible behavior these dinosaurs exhibit 
 never mind how much food they waste 
 or the dirrrrty-play they encourage: 
 but this - this 
 this is crazytown this is a scene you stage for children ranging in ages from 1-7 i mean i understand you wanna thin your herd considering how high your food-and-freezer bills must be but this is basically an encouragement to misadventure dcs would see this as a confession watch your back 
 i love that a great deal of the time the funniest parts of the scenes are things that are happening off to one side or in the background there's a lot going on in here and i love it 
 this is my favorite of all the dinosaurs: 
 because his expression can either be rage or terror or glee depending on what is going on around him 
 and i liked this bit of evolutionary cannibalism 
 but most of all i like that this book finally taught me what killed the dinosaurs: 
 ""food"" poisoning 
 guess i won't be going extinct anytime soon 
 great pictures usually funny captions genius idea 
 i will leave my door unlocked for you please 
 this is the last day of dinovember 
 (to be sung to the tune of: https://wwwyoutubecom/watchv=7hnqo) ""dear old world"" she murmured ""you are very lovely and i am glad to be alive in you"" 
 this quote really accurately depicts how anne lives her life and what makes you love her as a character she's stubborn and makes mistakes but she also has a huge imagination and sees the world as beautiful and full of possibilities 
 i loved this so much and i'm sad i never read it before i love all the characters and the plot and it's really fun to see anne grow up through this book the writing is also really really lovely 
 i can't wait to read the sequels and follow anne's story 
 this has made it up to my favorite books of all time list that's for sure 
 reread notes 
 i didn't think i could love this book more but somehow i do i am so emotional *reread july 2017* 
 reread for booktube-a-thon 2017 do i really have to tell you i loved it i think you should know that by now so amazing i can see many rereads of this in the years to come if these pictures don't show you why you need this book there's no hope for you 
 and yeah yeah yeah this isn't goodpicturescom and we're all of us first and foremost readers here and we love a good story more than anything else but sometimes pictures printed in startlingly vivid color 
 on heavy-stock paper 
 in which the illustrations are seemingly bursting out of the confines of the page 
 all sewn between two pleasantly soft clothbound boards 
 can make words take a backseat for a little while even for creatures such as we 
 the words don't make up a bad story it's just a bit meandering and lackluster and can be summed up as ""oh there it is"" 
 but if you're reading this book for the articles you're doing it wrong this is one of those books you appreciate because it is a beautiful object one that you will take down and admire when you just need the comfort of something pretty in front of your eyes 
 and i can personally attest to the fact that it makes a wonderful gift one i will revisit and flip through way more than say don quixote 
 so there 
 winner of that argument = me poor baudelaire siblings life really hasn't been easy on them these last few days the misfortune that incessantly befell them was heartbreaking 
 but the children are strong so strong and intelligent and brave they don't have anyone else in the world but each other 
 i fell for them as deeply as i fell for a little princess' sarah how could we as readers not after beholding such tragedy 
 because the orphans are so likeable which led me to care for them and their future i never wanted to stop reading being assured that violet klaus and sunny would find their happily ever after was my first preoccupation 
 many events conducted the lives of the baudelaires and although they were unmistakably unhappy and antagonistic ones i found charming how much we learned about the characters from them 
 however the story and its protagonists are not the only elements that will enthral readers i personally thought the writing style to be delightful simple but elegant and effective without being overly descriptive it produces vivid (grotesque) images in the reader's mind 
 while i understand why some disliked the liberty the author took in interrupting the flow of events for a second or two to swiftly provide a definition for certain words (or expressions) more literal i was never bothered by that and in fact welcomed the process 
 i couldn't do anything else but read this in one sitting they called to me those dear baudelaires 
 blog | youtube | twitter | instagram | google+ | bloglovin' sometimes i like to curl up in a ball so no one can see me because i'm so small 
 sometimes i like to jump high as i can 
 to see how much noise i can make when i land 
 sometimes i like to scream ever so loud not that i'm cross i just like how it sounds 
 sometimes i like to just walk round and round 
 i pigeon step pigeon step till i fall down 
 sometimes i like to stand still as a tree 
 and watch everyone rush around about me 
 sometimes i like to poke out my tongue 
 or make funny faces now that can be fun 
 sometimes i like to get in a real mess 
 with mud on my feet and my hands and my chest 
 sometimes i like to run ever so fast i sometimes come first but i sometimes come last* 
 but when the day ends and the sun starts to fall then i do what i do best of all i find somewhere soft somewhere cozy and smalland that's where i like to curl up in a ball 
 so do you guys know what this means it means that i am a wombat this is the best news ever 
 *it may not look like i am moving very fast here but i am ask caris he's that speck in the distance i honestly could not give this book any less than 5 stars it was beautiful and heartwarming i felt so much for george and really connected to her this book is just so important and whilst as a middle-grade this is an easy ready with a simple writing style i think that everyone should read it oh my goodness i absolutely adored this this brought me right back to childhood since i loved the movie as a kid so glad the book is just as good merry merry merry 
 this world will never stop delighting me 
 how can this be how can all the pieces of this puzzle coexist who is religious enough to create a book that tells the story of the nativity in a real straight way without any humorous adaptations that is deemed appropriate enough to be marketed as a religious book shelved accordingly but not too stodgy-religious to use guinea pigs to represent biblical figures and dress them up like mary and joseph to tell the story 
 or an angel: 
 or king herod 
 who gets mad 
 but still - still deems jesus special enough to not be played by a real live guinea pig but is instead a doll: 
 is that out of respect is it a sacrilege to dress up a guinea pig as jesus or would the baby pigs just not stay still long enough or are they just too icky when they are babies or is there some more insidious commentary going on here i don't know all i know is that these guinea pigs are dressed up in the biblical sense 
 how does this even exist in the world and why did it take so long and the best part is that these delightful guinea pigs are actually rescue guinea pigs so it's nice that they get to be stars after some stupid squeezy-handed kid decided they didn't want a pet anymore and they get credited and everything except jesus who is once again a doll 
 also nice to see the flexibility w/r/t traditional guinea pig gender roles if a girl guinea pig can grow up to be king herod then the world must truly be a better place than the world before this book was in it 
 merry freaking guinea pig christmas best day ever this book 
 in the words of the author(s) 
 where have you been all my life 
 this book is just insane amounts of fun the premise is very simple: danny is a greedy little boy who learns an important lesson about why we don't try to test the limits of santa's generosity because santa has tricks up his sleeve and ways to make naughty boys into nice boys for next year's reckoning 
 santa leaves danny a single present - a giant dinosaur egg 
 which hatches 
 and the dinosaur goes nuts eating everything in sight - the tree the decorations danny's family 
 also santa which seems like an oversight on santa's part 
 and this makes danny sad 
 which makes the dinosaur sad 
 with the feeling of guilt 
 in the dinosaur's gut 
 its brain brewed a plan 
 involving its butt 
 it knew there was only one thing it could do: 
 to put christmas right it needed to 
 amazing 
 please forgive those squiggly lines - i still haven't learned how to photograph off of a nook properly the camera sees things invisible to the naked eye 
 but so back to the poo 
 and it's a christmas miracle 
 christmas is restored just with a little more poo than anticipated on the decorations and whatnot 
 and everyone learns a lesson 
 i love this book so much 
 and i must read the other books in the series because one can never have too many books about poo 
 also - behold - there is a game attached to this book that you can play for free and it has just eaten up a lot of my time i am very bad at it but it is fun 
 now it's your turn to fall into a timesuck: 
 http://wwwrandomhousechildrenscouk 
 you're welcome 35 *all the world is made of faith and trust and pixie dust* stars 
 this truly is an odd book there were plenty of disturbing surprising wtf moments i made the stupid mistake of reading some peter pan theories that really creeped me out things i'm scared of- the wizard of oz movie clowns praying mantis john travolta now i can add peter pan to my list 
 this book genuinely creeped me out yes there are bittersweet and endearing moments the characters are compelling and well-developed but to be honest i contemplated quitting 
 *rains of castamere starts playing* 
 i don't want to ruin your experience by divulging too much so i will keep this short 
 yes there were moments of weirdness but i made it i finally read this classic i am unfortunately a female version of peter pan i'm still a child at heart 
 tinker bell warmed my heart my fondness for her derives from several factors: her mischievous personality her joie de vivre and her fierce loyalty to peter pan i have always had a fondness for fairies don't even bother telling me they're not real because i simply won't believe you 
 there's a little bit of peter pan in all of us yes eventually we may have to leave neverland but we will always remember yes my least favorite book in my favorite series it just keeps getting better and better folks 
 so for the three misguided people who havenaeur(tm)t read this series - first off get on that what are you doing there is nothing so important in your life that you canaeur(tm)t put it off in order to read this series 
 https://emmareadstoomuchwordpressco it might seem odd to review a book that has 10 pages and less than 20 words in it but when you're dealing with books for very little kids that's the landscape you're dealing with 
 barely 15 minutes ago my littlest boy brought this book up to me and said ""read daddy read"" 
 that's the baby version of a 5-star review 
 what really makes this book good is that it's one of the very first books you can read to your kid it will catch and hold their attention *long* before they can follow anything with plot or words this just has dogs making different barking noises 
 both my boys loved this book and cutie went through a period where there was nothing in the world funnier than one of the dogs going ""yip yip yip"" 
 he would laugh and laugh whenever i said that huge helpless baby chortles why who knows and who cares really we were having a great time reading a book together and that's what really matters happy mother's day to all of you mothers/people with mothers/abbesses/prioresses/etc 
 so after being given a janked-up e-copy on netgalley and losing two firstreads opportunities with this book i finally shelled out the ten bucks and bought a copy for myself and what i (finally) learned from this book is how happy it is to be a baby animal 
 i also learned some facts: 
 *anteater pups ride on mom's back for the first ten months of life mother and pup's black stripes line up with one another to preserve their camouflage 
 * the african painted dog can give birth to a litter as big as nineteen pups 
 * female pandas are only fertile for 2-3 days a year while the java mousedeer can become pregnant 2 1/2 hours after giving birth 
 * the canada lynx may be in the running for cutest yawn ever 
 i also learned how much nibbling there is in the animal kingdom from both mommies and babies alike 
 nature is delicious nom nom 
 and that mothers are fearless 
 but mostly i learned how sweet and tiny baby animals are which i already knew but half of education is repetition after all 
 but i also learned about lies 
 1) though small at birth king penguins grow into the largest and most handsome adult penguins 
 chinstrap penguin objects 
 2) you are not that echidna's mama lady 
 here are two for greg 
 fennec foxes 
 and bat-eared foxes 
 but my one complaint how do lions rate 5 pictures and red pandas only one 
 the injustice 
 ********************************************* 
 ***** update: this book is now up as a firstreads giveaway i am going to try to win but it'd better be more than just some blank green pages or karen smash*** 
 ********************************************* 
 okay as much as i hate to do this i'm calling it time of death: now 
 i was approved on netgalley for this book on january 23 and i said ""yaaayyyy baby animals"" however when i tried to download it only 18 of the 160 pages showed up 
 since it didn't say anywhere on the netgalley page that this was only a sample of the book and since the page did say ""email allowed"" i emailed on jan 26 no response i emailed again on feb 26 no response this thing is going to be archived soon so whatever i give up 
 the 18 pages i was allowed to see include the galley disclaimer: 
 this little thing which is probably the flier that is put into arcs and not actually part of the book itself: 
 this green page: 
 this green page with animal silhouettes: 
 this green page with animal silhouettes and the title of the book: 
 this green page (for those of you counting this is page 6 of 18 - we are 1/3 through what was given to me for review and there is zero actual content so far): 
 the dedication page: 
 this green page: 
 this title page (page nine - halfway through now) 
 the introduction: 
 and the glossary of acronyms used in the book (i mean i assume they are used in the book i have no way of knowing): 
 and on page 12 - our first bit of actual content which is two paragraphs about the northern sea otter 
 pages 13 14 and 15 are photos of a baby sea otter and its mother and page 16 17 and 18 are photos of a baby hippo and its mother and yes they are being adorable but it would have been nice to see more of the actual book and maybe fewer plain green pages since i'm meant to be giving feedback on the book and all 
 there's no accurate way to rate or review a book based on 6 pages so i guess i'll just wait and buy it when it comes out like someone who didn't get approved by netgalley and subsequently ignored by the publisher 
 lesson to be learned: ""email allowed"" does not necessarily mean ""email returned"" or even ""email acknowledged"" 
 thanks i guess 
 ********************************************* 
 oh my god wookit those red pandas i would (s)mother them like crazy love love love 
 also: counting this as my first booktubeathon read even if i read only 2 pages during the actual readathon i need all the books i can get ""but are you really pro-life"" asked alice ""because you know i've heard pro-life people talk before and they sound quite different"" 
 ""when i use a word"" trumpty drumpty said in rather a scornful tone ""it means just what i choose it to mean -- neither more nor less"" 
 ""the question is"" said alice ""whether you can make words mean so many different things"" 
 ""the question is"" said trumpty drumpty ""which is to be master -- that's all"" 
 alice was too puzzled to reply to this so she thought she had better change the subject 
 ""that is a fine wall mr drumpty"" she said after a while ""it must have cost you a great deal to build it"" 
 ""it cost me nothing"" said trumpty drumpty off-handedly ""every single cent of it came from my friends in mexico"" 
 ""they must be very good friends"" said alice politely 
 ""not in the least"" said trumpty drumpty ""but they had no choice you see first i sent back all the illegal immigrants; and then i said that if the mexican government didn't pay for my wall i'd stop those immigrants from wiring any money home"" 
 ""but if you had sent them back"" said alice who was now feeling even more puzzled ""then how--"" 
 ""you ask too many questions young lady"" snapped trumpty drumpty ""this interview is now over"" 
 ""nothing is going right today"" alice said to herself ""oh how i wish i hadn't taken that job with fox news"" we've had this book for a while and i was surprised to find that i hadn't already written about it on here already 
 simply said: my kids adore it and so do i 
 it's a fun story about a young girl who opens her house up to mythical creatures has some problems with her thoughtless guests then resolves them nice pacing lovely illustrations 
 the mythology isn't half-assed generic stuff either partially based in folklore partially original ben brought in the folletti which i had to look up if i knew of them at one point i'd forgotten about them 
 what puts this over the top as a kids book are some of the invisible extras not morals because morals are too frequently preachy and heavy handed i'm just talking about good socially nutritive stuff that it's nice to have in *any* book but that's triply nice to have in a kid's book 
 for example julia is a great character who happens to be a girl as opposed to being a tough girl character doing it for herself despite the fact that she's a girl and girls are usually seen as helpless in our culture (tm) she's hospitable and hard-working she takes care of her own problems 
 it's nice to see julia get frustrated then talk with people and make changes that will fix her frustrations it's nice to see people behaving thoughtlessly (which makes them rude) then changing their behavior to be helpful (which makes them kind) and it's nice to have a kid's book where everyone has chores because that's something kids should be exposed to in books 
 i love this approach in books it's not preachy or pushy but it has good things in it it's not like someone forcing medicine down your throat for your own good it's the equivalent of a healthy delicious meal 
 so yeah highly recommended 
 pat who ever said an actor cannot be an author no one ever because it's not true at all 
 well this was such a lovely surprise the world that chris colfer introduces us to is filled with magic charming creatures and familiar names of princesses princes fairytale heroes and heroines 
 although i'm one of those readers who can read anything from children's books to mature adult books it doesn't mean i like everything i stumble across for my middle grade reads i look for 1 creativity 2 enchanting and 3 deep 
 ''the land of stories: the wishing spell'' has a lot to offer: an enthralling adventure relatable heroes a scavenger hunt like never before seen lots of encounters with our favourite fairytale characters and most of all the type of storyline that offers something new with every new chapter 
 granted alex and conner do find most of their objects in a relatively easy manner and short amount of time; they're offered help everywhere they go but isn't a fairytale world supposed to be good and better than our own where kindness is not questioned and unceremoniously reciprocated 
 i enjoyed every second of my time with this book i'm going to have to say that the beginning is not as great as what follows the eighty first pages and that is because we are still in the human world before that but once alex and conner reach the land of stories it's good time after good time after good time 
 to all of those who haven't read this yet y'all are some lucky fellows to be able to experience this story for the first time 
 blog | youtube | twitter | instagram | google+ | bloglovin' winnie-the-pooh light of my life fire of my loins my sin my soul win-knee-the-pooh: the tip of the lip taking a trip of three steps down the palate to return at four to kiss : pooh he was pooh plain pooh in the morning standing eighteen inches in one sock he was that scruffy old bear at school he was mr winnie pooh on the dotted line but in my arms he was always bear i can't express how much i love this book my son is currently whining because he's supposed to be napping 
 yeah good fucking luck on that one 
 but this book is so awesome because it's true i think i've thought almost every word in this book toward my son at some point 
 seriously boy mummy needs her goodreads time so go the fuck to sleep in high school i loaned this to a girlfriend and then she dumped me and then i called her house like every day all ""give me my book back"" until she finally left it outside my door so she wouldn't have to talk to me 
 i was a pretty big fan of this book just a wonderful magical extraordinary book the kind of classic-feeling book you can put in the hands of a little girl and feel confident that with it she will grow into a wonderful magical extraordinary creature herself it might work on boys too who knows but right now i am speaking to the fathers i know with young daughters who are looking for that book that will leave an impression on them in a literary role-model kind of way: a strong and smart and brave little girl raised by an eccentric man who may not have taught her much about how to be conventional but who has shared a love of language and adventure and has raised her to be fierce and loyal and courageous and independent 
 and on top of the glowing character(s) the language of the book is pure milky chocolate - just lovely and unexpected prose that really stands out when compared to any other book ever this is a book i would have read until it fell apart if it had been around for me when i was say eight or so this is a book you read when you are little and then take to college with you and then hand down to your own daughters it is for sickbed reading reading aloud savoring and treasuring and pulling down from the shelves as needed this book is begging to be inscribed and given as a gift 
 there is nothing i don't like about this book and there is no way i can do it justice an extended quote is the best i have for you 
 sophie is our young heroine charles the man who took her in as a baby when she was found in the water after the capsizing of a boat and miss eliot the social worker who disapproves of the whole situation here: 
 miss eliot did not approve of charles nor of sophie she disliked charles's carelessness with money and his lateness at dinner 
 she disliked sophie's watching listening face ""it's not natural in a little girl"" she hated their joint habit of writing each other notes on the wallpaper in the hall 
 ""it's not normal"" she said scribbling on her notepad ""it's not healthy"" 
 ""on the contrary"" said charles ""the more words in a house the better miss eliot"" 
 miss eliot also disliked charles's hands which were inky and his hat which was coming adrift round the brim she disapproved of sophie's clothes 
 charles was not good at shopping he spent a day standing bewildered in the middle of bond street and came back with a parcel of boys' shirts miss eliot was livid 
 ""you cannot let her wear that"" she said ""people will think she is deranged"" 
 sophie looked down at herself she fingered the material it felt quite normal to her; still a little stiff from the shop but otherwise fine ""how can you tell it's not a girl's shirt"" she asked 
 ""boys' shirts button left over right blouses - please note the word is blouses - button right over left i am shocked that you don't know that"" 
 charles put down the newspaper behind which he had retreated ""you are shocked that she doesn't know about buttons buttons are rarely key players in international affairs"" 
 ""i beg your pardon"" 
 ""i meant she knows the things which are important not all of them of course; she is still a child but many"" 
 miss eliot sniffed ""you'll forgive me; i may be old-fashioned but i think buttons do matter"" 
 ""sophie"" said charles ""knows all the capitals of all the countries of the world"" 
 sophie standing in the doorway whispered ""almost"" 
 ""she knows how to read and how to draw she knows the difference between a tortoise and a turtle she knows one tree from another and how to climb them only this morning she was telling me what is the collective noun for toads"" 
 ""a knot"" said sophie ""it's a knot of toads"" 
 again - there is nothing i do not love about this book while re-reading this series my main question is why the hell is an incompetent banker the only adult helping these children like where are the police or social workers usually i'm annoyed with books that present a dead character in a story and even make them part of the main cast because we don't know them as well as the characters in the book do 
 but ali benjamin succeeded to make me care about suzy's best friend who drowned and died leaving her friendless and feeling alone 
 except suzy was already friendless even before her best friend died 
 in the story there is the past and the present the past focuses on the relationship between suzy and her best friend as if she were writing in a journal to franny the present focuses on suzy trying to find an explanation to franny's death 
 in her own way she is coping with her best friend's death but not in the right way she's not moving on it's like she's not able to move past this until she is able to prove that franny could not have really perished in a drowning accident seeing that she was a great swimmer 
 it's a very moving story and very sad also i cared so much for suzy and although my heart was breaking every time suzy made a connection between franny's death and jellyfish (which was always) i kept on reading with the hope that things will turn out okay for suzy 
 ali benjamin's writing is simply beautiful it's easy to get lost in her words to let them envelope us congrats to her for writing a wonderful realistic story with the theme of grief and loss 
 blog | youtube | twitter | instagram | google+ | bloglovin' former president george w bush named this his favorite book from childhood (it came out when he was 23  but perhaps he meant his kids' childhood) in any event it's one of my favorites from my childhood and from reading to my own kids was it the first to put holes through its pages probably not but it worked very well kids like sticking their fingers in things - genius 
 anyhow - this is one hungry caterpillar he puts a hole through everything be it a slice of watermelon (or wacca menon as my daughter first said it) ice cream cone or sausage 
 it is in fact one of the bestselling books in the history of literature 
 http://mark---lawrenceblogspotcouk 
 so what does this epic teach us 
 1/ everything in moderation our caterpillar just sticks a single hole in each food item - he ain't that sort of greedy he'll leave some for others 
 2/ try new things our caterpillar ain't picky he'll try anything once even gherkin 
 3/ eat healthy to avoid stomach ache a nice green leaf will sort you out 
 4/ change is good straighten up and fly right and you too could become a beautiful butterfly and um  fly right

 books are all so different just like people are different morry is a young book on the shelf and longs to be read he wants fingerprints smudges and bent corners the older books in the library tell him heaeur(tm)s better off just staying on the shelves but heaeur(tm)s persistent and decides that anythingaeur(tm)s better for him than living a life of nothingness he's thinking about jumping off the shelf in hopes of being discovered when a book named jane gives him a shove and morry falls to his back this part is quite scary as some of the books prove to be a little violent follow along in the story to find out if morry will ever be discovered 
 what an imagination it took to write this book the faces on the books are so realistic and the conversations between the books are hilarious when you study the faces on the books youaeur(tm)ll notice that they're the true authors themselves i thought the illustrations were very colorful and interesting once you get to the end the author mentions all of her favorite authors that sheaeur(tm)s enjoyed in her life some of which are used in the book itaeur(tm)s thought-provoking even for adults when you think about how some of the classic authors are all smudged up with heavy wear and then others havenaeur(tm)t been touched at all overall itaeur(tm)s a good book that kids will enjoy 
 4**** i think i'll be filming a video review about this one so i'll keep it brief: this was fantastic the writing was a bit too simple for my taste (it's written for children so it makes sense) but other than that it was perfect this book is crap and let me tell you why the kid is a jerk and is sent to his room without supper he proceeds to go to some magical place where these monsters live and he bosses them around and is mean to them then he gets back homehaving not learned that being a mean jerk is wrongand there on his table in his room is dinnerand it's still warm what's the lesson here exactly 
 hate the book a moat is not a goat is a collection of 13 poems celebrating all that is wonderful about little girls for those of you with daughters you will recognize your little girl in one or more of these poems perhaps you will recognize the brave little pirate girl who donning a crown pink gown and a glittery cape heads off on the high seas seeking adventure by writing her own stories (""true treasure"") or perhaps your little girl is like the one who maybe cut her own bangs (or fringe) a bit too short (""snippety-snip"") or perhaps your little girl has a vast imagination and wishes to explore far-off kingdoms deep oceans or places where dinosaurs roam through coloring with crayons (""happiness"") 
 the messages hidden within these short poems vary depending on the theme of the poem but they all have one thing in common: they all have the potential to empower little girls for example the last line in the poem happiness states ""happiness is knowing that all toys are both for girls and boys"" in move over miss muffet little miss wafer learns from miss muffet's experience and keeps herself safe from a snake by climbing into a hammock the walk-away lesson at the end of the poem is ""for where there is a plan there is a way"" 
 my favorite poem is sniffle sniffle which reminded me of shel silverstein's poem ""sick"" (which i happen to have recited in elementary school at a poetry competition) in this poem the little girl staying home from school is hoping to read watch tv eat ice cream and otherwise play on her ""day off"" but she is disappointed when ""mom made me stay in bed all day"" that's a lesson for parents 
 the illustrations in a moat is not a goat are magnificent i absolutely loved them the illustrations all feature the most adorable little girls representing cultural diversity as well as diversity in settings i also like that the girls were sometimes dressed up in ""girlie"" clothes (ie dresses) featuring colors that you would typically associate with girls (ie pink); but some of the girls were dressed in pants or overalls in more gender-neutral colors in this way girls can know that it is ok if they want to dress up in ""little girl"" clothes but they can also choose to dress in more gender-neutral or ""boy clothes"" if they prefer the only thing i would say is that all the girls were depicted with at least shoulder length hair it would have been great to include shorter hairstyles as well 
 my bottom line: 
 a moat is not a goat is a wonderful collection of short poems (varied length) celebrating little girls each poem features culturally diverse little girls in a variety of circumstances all centered around the message of empowerment the accompanying illustrations are absolutely gorgeous i highly recommend this wonderful collection of short poems to teachers librarians and parents to read to children while girls are the obvious target i do think the book would make a great discussion starter exploring gender stereotypes in a classroom setting ages 4 to 8 
 * i purchased a kindle version of this book from amazon all opinions expressed in this review represent my honest opinions about the book except for the persistent india bashing i loved this book in fact mistress mary i loved the ending so much that i forgive your english superiority complex next time you visit here though allow me to take you on the ride across india i hope your impression will change february 
 as part of my personal reading challenges for 2017 once a month i will be revisiting a favorite book from when i was a little bitty karen and seeing if it holds up to my fond memories and determining if i can still enjoy it as an old and crotchety karen 
 fingers crossed 
 so: first things first in answer to the question 'does this book hold up' yes it does again i read this book so many times as a kid there was a cozy-blanket familiarity to reading it so many years later but i felt just as invested in anda's struggle as i did when i was a kid and the book didn't feel childish at all it's a genuinely good story with a realistic character at its center whose frustrations and determination make her genuinely sympathetic and likable 
 baby-karen's review: 
 i like this book because i am very good at gymnastics* and i liked it when anda rescued that cat from the roof but it was sad when it got hit by a car but i'm glad it was okay even though it got hit by a car my dog got hit by a car one time and he was not okay so it's good her cat didn't die i also liked the blizzard because i love the snow 
 adult-review: 
 i think this book is responsible for my adult love of dance movies the plot is pretty much the plot for every dance movie ever - young unwealthy girl has all the talent and grit to land her in the highest echelon of competitive world mostly populated by affluent peers but is held back by poverty-based obstacles: missing a competition because the rusty old truck breaks down missing practice because a sick goat must be tended to without even a telephone to make other transportation arrangements but lo opportunity in the form of a scholarship is within her grasp if only she can win better than anyone else and become a star 
 no better drama no more fulfilling triumph 
 this has all the ups and downs of an olympic backstory: sacrifice millie mollie  overcoming illness injury and innate stubbornness learning self-control harnessing all that unfocused energy into discipline and accepting that life isn't all tumblesaults; sometimes you gotta learn ballet too 
 her mom's kind of a drag though i'm not sure why i'm scrutinizing the adults in these books so much as i reread them except for the fact that i am closer to their age than anda's and when i was a kid grown-ups weren't interesting and i didn't have an adult perspective but now money woes are unfortunately very familiar to me and having just read you will know me which is about a family with a gymnast prodigy and how everything revolves around her training and the sacrifices they have to make in order to afford that lifestyle i can understand where her parents are coming from with the caution and stress-crankiness but her mom is pretty chilly for a hippie with a backyard fulla goats and chickens she's not horrible but she has enough moments where you wanna shove her outta the way of anda's path to glory 
 a few loose comments: 
 i totally had a crush on anda when i was little and i used to think this picture was real cute 
 but now i am old and that kind of thing is creepy so i have to get over her sorry anda 
 i had forgotten this took place in england there's no big revelation there it was just a moment of ""oh yeah"" when i saw the glossary at the front where some of the terms are 'translated' for non-british readers 
 i did find one error that i must have missed as a kid because it didn't spark anything in me but bella is indeed a special cat: 
 ""oh look daddy she's got pink feet her paws are pink on the bottom like pink beads look at her white whiskers oh she's got little white eyelashes why are her eyes blue"" 
 ""they'll change"" said bill steering murgatroyd carefully round a group of moorland sheep ""they'll go green as she gets older or yellow oh she's magic isn't she"" 
 she is magic because her eyes go both green and yellow about thirty pages later she has green jewel eyes and then about twenty pages after that they are yellow kaleidoscope cat 
 i am very excited to continue this rereading project will they all hold up let's find out 
 * adult edit - childhood self-confidence aside i was not ""very good"" at gymnastics i was tragic on balance beam and like anda i hated the floor-dancing parts the only things i was good at were the ones where you fling your body about without worrying about the landing parts - i was strongest on vault decent at uneven bars and i liked the flippy parts of the floor routine because wheeee but ""very good"" not hardly 
 **************************************** 
 just as good as i remember review to come for now fume with me over the fact that there are two other books connected to this one making this a little gymnast trilogy that i never knew about and am now gonna need to track down

 **************************************** 
 the second of my middle grade rereads for 2017-project 
 this one has a different bookplate: 
 and another ""how karen kept track of her reading when she was a baby"" account: 
 and it was even cheaper than wait till helen comes 
 will it hold up let's see 
 january: wait till helen comes 
 march: zucchini 
 april: something queer at the library 
 may: good-bye pink pig 
 june: the girl with the silver eyes 
 july: the phantom tollbooth one of the great tear-jerkers of my long-lost childhood the unlikely friendship between a spider and a pig makes for wonderful reading and a shared moment of love when reading it to kids it is tender and teaches the values of constancy and integrity in a light beautiful prose a classic and a masterpiece this book infuriated me what a lazy author taking us down the garden path through 12 books and then ending the series without really completing the story as a children's librarian i no longer recommend this series to kids i hate to see them as disappointed as i was at this really stupid final book shame on you mr snicket you took the chicken's way out next time have an idea of where you expect the series to go before you start it truly shameful what a silly qs 
 of course i do love books & sure i want some adventures 
 and above all i adore the magic of cinema

 this girl as yet scarcely old enough to have a couple of cherries or a leaping dolphin tattooed near her cameltoe was named dorothy one day like so many dreamy-eyed girls she donned her skechers and her discount department store jeans and waited for a meteorological disaster to rescue her from her sad glitterless rural life 
 as luck would have it one day an especially violent cyclone (rated ef4 by the local weather service) carved a bloody path of destruction misery and death through central kansas carrying dorothy's trailer (with her and her dog toto inside watching judge judy) high into the troposphere at first dorothy mistook the rhythmic vibrations for a circuit party and looked under the bed for her whistle but soon enough she realized she was airborne and it felt fab u lous she thought she even spotted a cross-country virgin america flight with diana ross sitting in first class refusing a skunky glass of chardonnay and calling the stewardess an uppity white bitch (she'll have dershowitz on the phone when she gets to lax) but maybe dorothy was unconscious and imagining it all at any rate she was immune to the ghastly soul-rending shrieks rising from below of a kansas mother cradling her dead baby who was impaled by a windswept awl in the cyclone she was busy listening to ""yahoo"" by erasure on her ipod 
 eventually after floating around earth's gaseous atmosphere for a couple of hours dreaming of barney's co-op sale dorothy landed in some unknown land flat-ironed her hair and repositioned her training thong outside her trailer a bunch of ghetto midgets were milling around with some old witchy broad no it wasn't that uberfem glinda - like in the movie - it was some tired-ass old mannish thing looking like linda hunt in the year of living dangerously basically this bitch is no help at all she's supposedly a witch and you'd think she'd know the way to the meatpacking district but all she does is give her some cheap-ass silver shoes (steve madden - yuck) and kiss dorothy on the forehead leaving this ""magical"" lipmark dorothy suspects it's herpes simplex one and hightails it outta there before the witch gives her boxed wine and has her pose for ""art"" photographs (yes i remember the very special episode of diff'rent strokes with gordon jump very well thank you very much) 
 okay you know the rest of the story (for the most part) dorothy seeks out the wizard of oz by mapquesting emerald city (or alternately the city of emeralds) and on the way she meets a scarecrow a tin woodman and a lion who are all needy and want to bask in the glow of her super-hot blinding aura and fierce fantabulousness (and bum a few amphetamines) the wizard who likes to mix up his corporeal manifestations appears to them in his emerald city throne room (picture antwan ""big boi"" patton's house on cribs but with fewer stripper poles and lots more green marble ) in the forms of a giant little richard-sized head a sears catalog swimsuit model a vaguely menacing monster and a talking ball of fire obviously the wizard has been to see cirque de soleil and knows the power of a little quebecois razzle-dazzle whilst filing his nails and reading the latest issue of interview with drew barrymore on the cover the wizard tells his motley supplicants that yeah yeah sure he will grant their stupid retarded wishes if they murder the wicked witch of the west a tribeca scenester who is always bogarting page six with her leather-daddy winged monkey warehouse parties dorothy & crew reluctantly agree - an act of volition which effectively makes dorothy the youngest hit girl in the history of ya literature and the only one to ever wear lace-trimmed socklets eventually during a wet t-shirt contest the witch melts and dorothy still flush with her first taste of killing sweet killing returns with her entourage to the wizard to claim her payoff but then gosh golly gee whiz in a startling atheistic allegory the all-powerful wizard is revealed to be an impotent little wallace shawn-type standing behind a screen fiddling with some sound board knobs nietzsche couldn't've said it any better the wizard who realizes he's dealing with a bunch of saps here pretends to grant everyone's wishes (except dorothy's - cuz he's totally jealous of her fabulousness) and they actually fall for it dorothy burnt-out on the emerald city scene and suffering from dehydration and exhaustion longs to return to kansas to start her autobiographical blog a bunch of stupid stuff happens some of which involve a hot air balloon and bitch-slapping trees and the quartet make their way to glinda the witch of the south to see if she can grant dorothy's wish and thereby prove that she's at least somewhat less worthless than everybody else in oz 
 on the way to the glinda's 'hood the posse comes across a village where all the people are made of china and break easily (gee i wonder why they left that great episode out of the film) and after the lion accidentally destroys one of their china churches with his tail (i'm not kidding) giving impetus to hate crime legislation the world over the tin woodman decapitates some wolves with his ax dorothy skips and frolics through the gory pools of matted fur blood and steaming viscera and asks glinda who appears to be on quaaludes for a trip home glinda as useless as every other allegedly magical person in oz tells her that the cheap-ass steve madden shoes she's been wearing could've gotten her back to kansas all along (and by the way when she returns to the sticks she should really take off those chinese panda-skin leatherette things they'll give her fatal foot rash) 
 so dorothy uses the magic of those shoes made in china under the brand name of a man imprisoned for magical tax evasion to return to kansas where her aunt and uncle have long since forgotten about her and adopted a more attractive latvian girl who's not too prissy to hand-inseminate the cows dorothy overdoses one night in a dilapidated feed barn on a potent mixture of robitussin and gas-x and judy davis plays her in a television movie that no one remembers long enough to have forgotten 5 stars from my little girl jess (age 7)

 ""i'm glad that matilda can live with miss honey"" tolkien must have been an excellent farther to his children to put so much thought and effort into the making of these letters speaks of nothing but devotion they're so well crafted by a master of the pen the calligraphy alone is fantastic to look at it's quite revealing too it's like a little peek into the family life of the tolkien's one which shows the patriarch as a kindly gentleman that he no doubt was this is a great little book 
 i do recommend this edition in particular because it shows the original print along with a text version this means it can be read easily because some of the originals are quite dense true story: when i was a kid our school librarian read this to us in class that night when i was drifting off to sleep i found that the creature had followed me home and was scratching on the wall right outside which was totally unfair because i hadn't even taken his damn tailypo i mean do your research jerk i had to sleep in my parents' bed for like a week and that's why i have no younger siblings way to go tailypo i'm reading through this series with my daughter celyn (10 years old very disabled hence dad does the reading) 
 edit: finished & reviewed all 13 
 so this is a clever entertaining book set in a world like ours but populated with bizarre characters and with distinctly dark undercurrents 
 recurring themes throughout the series are: 
 i) adults are mindbogglingly stupid 
 ii) the narrator lemony snicket is a character we glimpse in tantalising snatches 
 iii) words that stretch a child's vocabulary are used regularly but defined in context (by the narrator) in an amusing way 
 iv) the three siblings violet (14) klaus (12) and sunny (1) will use their singular talents (respectively inventor/bookworm/biter) to solve the problem 
 v) that problem will be count olaaf 
 the book (like roald dahl's work) succeeds with a combination of wit slapstick and malice 
 short very readable will leave you wanting the next 
 this one sets the scene rapidly orphaning the children establishing the goal (to survive long enough to take control of their huge inheritance) and their adversary (count olaaf and his theatre troop of sinister villains) 
 we have ten of the books because my elder children loved them when they were young on book 5 i'm thinking we'll probably read them all 
 edit: i have now posted reviews of all 13 books in the series - check them out 
 you should join my 3-emails-a-year mailing list for updates about my books #prizes http://eepurlcom/cimnk1 
  if i could give this more stars i would 
 yes i know the title indicates this book is for rebel girls i am a mother of two fairly rebellious boys - but felt it was every bit as relevant for them as it was for females after all why shouldn't boys read about fabulous inspirational women too 
 this book is an absolute thing of beauty - 100 accessible creatively written tales of women who helped to shape the world we live in the illustrations are superb and it hits just the right note with my two kids (5 and 7) they were initially suspicious that it was going to be one of those 'educational' books but a few stories in and they were hooked 
 people with boys don't be deterred from buying this book simply because the title indicates a female bias it's so important that we start recognising the achievement of women (past and present) because they've so often been ignored - and both girls and boys can benefit from this also - a word of warning grown-ups are likely to get a bit hooked on it too :-) oh how i wish i had read this wonderful book when i was a little girl 
 and i seriously think this would make a magnificent animated story 
 it's just that charming and magical i mean i suppose you already assume that from the original title and beautiful cover but i can assure you that there is no exaggeration about them 
 from the setting to the story to the characters everything is marvellous but really who never dreamed of owning 100 gowns - exquisite gowns 
 but wait a second these dresses don't only make you look extraordinary they also make you look different indeed put them on and you become someone else completely 
 when darling discovers them she is in awe shocked but then again she wished for an adventure and well adventure found her 
 it truly is a fun book truthfully the writing could have been more fairytale-esque and we sure could have seen a little more of princess mariposa but darling and her friends - including the animals - as well as the rest of the characters bring this book to life with the intention of enthralling the reader 
 and it works it does one hell of a job of gripping our attention i must admit there are repetitions which are understandable since one is bound to find routine when dwelling in the same place but i seriously believe an escapade somewhere would have done the plot wonders 
 but whatever it's still so so loveable if you want to add sparkles to your childhood or just brighten your day pick if the magic fits up you won't regret it darlings *wink* *wink*

 pre-review: 
 you know what i've been wanting to reread these books for probably a decade and i'm still (inexplicably) battling my ever present book funk so i'm just gonna do it 
 gilbert blythe you were my first and best book boyfriend see you soon ;) my reaction after reading this: 
 2 stars 
 whoa 
 why 
 really 
 so first off i would like to say that i really really really wanted to like this book since many human beings read and love this book and many have considered this as one of their favorite books of all time and before i posted my rating i browse the ratings of other gr members so that i know that i'm not the only abnormal human being who doesn't think that this book is good or great or whatever 
 (*coughs* sorry i forgot to turn off the capslock i'm not shouting or anything *coughs* just please don't judge me *coughs* if you like the book i respect you for that but i really can't force myself into believing i like this book _(><)v) 
 okay i'll try to explain what i don't like about it: 
 1 the book is boring 
 2 the book is weird 
 3 i don't feel any emotions at all towards the character 
 4 i don't really understand the book 
 5 i don't really understand the ending 
 6 i don't really understand why this utopia world should have no colors no feelings and no music so that the people would live *coughs* decently 
 7 i don't really understand why the children at age whatever should be given ribbons what's the purpose of that 
 8 i don't really understand why the characters should tell about their dreams to their parents 
 9 i don't understand why johnas has to take medications because he was having stirrings so stirrings for those who haven't read the book is somewhat closer to wet dreams 
 10 i don't understand why the memories of war loss etc would make someone want to end his/her life or give up on life i know that life is imperfect but it seems that the characters have no backbone like idk i don't buy the logic of that one 
 11 in short i don't really understand this at all 
 if you're wondering whether i've read this one because it's a school requirement the answer is no i buy this book because i've seen it on the list of best ya book here on goodreads so many times and if these book is bombarded with symbolism then please explain this to me(since i don't have brains for symbolism people) especially the ending (what the fudge is that) and i might change my rating i repeat might un libro tan brillante como una estrella me corrijo: mi estrella la que para mi siempre sera la mas brillante `ndm bd't hdh ljz knt mtkhwf mn 'n jd 'hdth mshbh@ lljzy'yn lsbqynwlkny knt mkhty'

  shrbyny overrated it practically begs the reader to come to the conclusion that if you don't ""get it"" it's your own fault because you're a ""grown up and only kids can see what matters"" the truth is there's nothing to get it's heavy handed clumsily executed observations on what's important in life it's not wrong by any means but it's the kind of pseudo-intellectual detritus that 
 freshmen philosophy majors will discuss as they pass the joint 
 i'm going to go with a literal interpretation of the plot because why the hell not: 
 a man crashes his plane in the desert hallucinates a small alien boy that teaches him philosophical lessons invents a history for him finds a well just in time to stave off dehydration as he re-hydrates his hallucinated alien friend kills himself and disappears he fixes his plane and flies home and is sad about it but feels blessed for the experience as it has changed him 
 ready for the moral it's really simple: 
 ""it is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important"" or in other words spend your time developing relationships don't worry so much about the things they're not important it's the time you spend and how you spend it that is 
 that's a nice philosophy i get it but this book is silly we actually finished this last night but i had already updated our reading so whoops i'm going to include her star rating for the review's rating but will try to include both our ratings here as well there was something so special when we were starting chapter six and she kept asking ""just one more chapter please mama"" until we had finished the entire book the story did a fantastic job of drawing both adult and child in right from the beginning and i appreciated all the dinosaur information included for children to learn facts while reading the ending left us with a magical feeling and she immediately said ""i can't wait to start the next book"" which made my mama heart happy 
 mckenna rating: 5 stars 
 mama rating: 45 stars 
 i'd say this was a win any way you look at it highly recommended 
 ********************************* more sloth mania 
 this is an adorable book about a little girl who wants a pet her mother tells her you can have any pet you want as long as it doesn't need to be walked or bathed or fed 
 so she gets a sloth in the mail 
 and while sparky the sloth is very adorable and huggable with his ""flat nose and monkey face"" 
 he's not the most  playful pet 
 nor the most obedient 
 which is a problem because she has already boasted to the bratty and scoffing mary potts that sparky's a great pet and she's going to prove it by putting on a big show where sparky will perform astonishing tricks 
 oh and there will be glitter 
 and it's all so adorable i can almost overlook all the lies 
 because of course sloths need to eat 
 and be bathed 
 and okay maybe not walked sloths are not the best at distance but they'll still come to getcha 
 until they get too sleepy 
 and while this one girl couldn't get sparky to play with her sloths are actually pretty good at hide-and-seek 
 and also at whatever this game is: 
 but then - again - too much exertion makes a sloth sleepy 
 so yes an adorable picture book that you need to have in your collection 
 special thanks to catherine for writing this review which alerted me that this book existed 
 and also special thanks to kristin (kc) for giving me this little treat happy birthday greg 
 a review for greg 
 this is a wonderful little book; part of jean craighead george's american woodland tale series which are cute little illustrated chapter books about animals in the wild and the things that they do while we are exposed to the inner thoughts of vulpes he is thankfully not a fox that talks so there is a semblance of realism here he has motivations for his actions but they are very practical vulpes doesn't sit around yearning for things or trying to make friends with the human characters or anything he finds food he finds a mate he learns about the dangers of his environment all things that foxes actually need to do in order to survive with none of the disney singing owls or clumsy woodpeckers 
 but most importantly there is a scene in which vulpes hunts for food under the snow like this: 
 http://wwwyoutubecom/watchv=d2sogh 
 which is the coolest thing foxes do howdeedoodat 
 now since this is a realistic-type story i got some bad news for you look nature is a tough broad and not everything in this book is going to be smiles and fuzzy hugs 
 so to cheer up the way i felt at the end of this book 
 okay better now i have a bunch more in this series but i'm not sure i can face the widdle raccoon just yet 
 but soon once i regroup emotionally loved this book so much 
 i loved auggie 
 cant wait to see the film ""the library of souls"" is out now get yourself a copy today & get ready to be spooked: https://tco/2kjyddg25j all of the stars for a favorite children's classic 
 i loved this book as a child i have several copies -- at minimum: the dog-eared paperback from when i was a girl a wonderful antique hardcover and the kindle version i have wanted to reread 
 a little princess 
 since i joined gr in 2014 today i borrowed an audio version from hoopla on a whim -- after recently seeing another reading buddy doing rereads of childhood favorites i am so glad that i read it again unlike some other childhood favorites that i have revisited i loved this as much  if not more than i did as a youngster 
 the following link has a synopsis of this wonderful story - as well as a listing of the many versions of the movie that were made i do fondly remember the one starring shirley temple; however i always preferred the book 
 https://enwikipediaorg/wiki/a_littl 
 top 3 favorite quotes: 
 ""never did she find anything so difficult as to keep herself from losing her temper when she was suddenly disturbed while absorbed in a book people who are fond of books know the feeling of irritation which sweeps over them at such a moment the temptation to be unreasonable and snappish is one not easy to manage"" 
 ""what you have to do with your mind when your body is miserable is to make it think of something else"" 
 ""i am a princess all girls are even if they live in tiny old attics even if they dress in rags even if they aren't pretty or smart or young they're still princesses"" 
 it was so much fun revisiting this classic by 
 frances hodgson burnett 
 that i am motivated to read more of her works (including some adult novels) potentially i will reread 
 the secret garden 
 as well 
 audiobook - i listened to the 2016 version narrated by karen savage there are many versions to choose from this version was well narrated and compelling (but i haven't listened to other versions to compare) my only constructive feedback is that an announcement is made at the end of each chapter (ie end of chapter 2) and then there is a few seconds of white space before the next chapter begins i'm not used to this but it (obviously) didn't impact my enjoyment of the book at least 2 versions are available on hoopla time required is about 55 hours this is not a book review so much as a fulfillment of a request by ladies whose whims i cannot refuse

 edward gorey was an american illustrator and as such his children or ""tinies"" meet their ends in very american ways they all have ""accidents"" befall them (excluding the suspiciously-like-suicide situations of zillah neville and james) this book is seemingly representative of the american attitude towards blame circa 1963 everything that happens is unfortunate but the parents are not responsible what was ida doing by the lake when she drowned probably eating apple pie and supporting our troops and rhoda was simply lighting 4th of july sparklers when she became consumed by fires written today all of these drawings would be followed by a panel indicating what steps were taken w/r/t litigation after the children's deaths the peach orchards would be sued for allowing ernest to choke upon a peach stone the train company would be paying for victor's death for years to come but this historical artifact is an exercise in cause rather than effect and certainly free of affect it is coldhearted american realism with an anti-abortion message if there are stairs your children will fall down them so the more children you make the less you have to actually look after them just play the odds 
 battle royale on the other hand takes the japanse perspective japan is a country smaller than california but it has about a zillion people on it their concerns as depicted in this novel seem to be about downsizing their population and embracing martial darwinism suicide is not an option for the japanese - that is military old hat (helmet) for them and far less entertaining than drugging an entire class of children and making them fight each other to the death on an island while wearing schoolgirl miniskirts this is a bold political move to bring in some revenue and to make room for their businessmen and oversized monsters only the strong and the crazy will survive and that is predicted to make for the most interesting gene pool 
 here the children are expendable as they are in gorey's tract but ultimately the two philosophies have different endgoals gorey claims ""yes your parental fears are valid - children are fragile and will inevitably come to harm"" which encourages americans to stay in their bedrooms ignore the children they already have (who are going to fall whether they are being watched or not) and make more babies for america while in battle royale the teens have their intercourses during the actual games so that murder and death are shown to be the most effective forms of birth control which keeps the population down and lessens the need for future battles 
 kids are gonna die it's a fact of life 
 but some are gonna go out in a blaze of glory with a scythe if you are interested in stories with happy endings you would be better off reading some other book in this book not only is there no happy ending there is no happy beginning and very few happy things in the middle this is because not very many happy things happened in the lives of the three baudelaire youngsters violet klaus and sunny baudelaire were intelligent children and they were charming and resourceful and had pleasant facial features but they were extremely unlucky and most everything that happened to them was rife with misfortune misery and despair i'm sorry to tell you this but that is how the story goes 
 i am ashamed to say that i have had this 13 book hardback boxset since 2013 and i am just now getting around to it i put it on one of my challenges for this year but now i'm thinking i might should wait for the tv show on netflix i wonder when that is coming out 
 ***some spoilers*** 
 these poor kids they are just having a day of play when they find out their parents die in a fire at their house and they have nothing 
 and mr poe who is oblivious and lives in his own little world sends them to life with a distant relative - the evil count olaf all he count wants is the children's money that violet is to get when she comes of age 
 olaf makes the children do horrible chores cook sleep in one bed and the house is atrocious but the kids do find some peace with the neighbor justice strauss she lets them cover over and read books from her library oh the joy of that =) 
 but the evil olaf has a plan to get the money all for himself and he almost succeeds but violet is a little too smart for old olaf and i loved it 
 i saw the movie for this years ago and i think someone told me it is compiled of the first three books i thought it was good though i am really looking forward to the netflix tv series and the rest of the books 
 my blog: melissa martin's reading list when i first saw this cover online months before the book was released i thought to myself ""i will make you mine"" 
 and then i did 
 surpeficially the artwork reminded me of a cutesier shaun tan or a less-gross renee french but i know nothing about art and when i mentioned this observation to art-snob sean of the house he scoffed and pointed to a couple of illustrations and said ""shaun tan would never do that or that"" so i guess i'm wrong sean of the house does not care for the art in this book but i love it so i choose this book over him 
 this is a wordless picture book in which a little girl is left alone at home and decides to take the bus to visit her grandmother she falls asleep and misses her stop and when she disembarks she finds herself deep in the forest with no one to ask for help no human anyway fortunately she meets a beautiful and mysterious stag 
 who takes her on a magical journey where they meet other creatures 
 before she is eventually restored to her parents spoiler alert yeah but it's a children's book - how did you think it was going to end 
 it seems like a sweet whimsical story but its inspiration comes from a sadder and more haunting source the bus and getting-lost parts are true but the animal-intervention was not the author is chinese and she came up in the 1980's under china's one-child policy from the author's note: 
 when i was young both of my parents had to work to support our family so during the day my grandmother would take care of me but still sometimes - if they had to rush to work or if nai nai was busy - they would leave me home alone this experience was common in many families at that time i belonged to a very lonely generation of children 
 and this loneliness permeates the illustrations even when it is - yes sean - a little cutesy 
 i just thought it was lovely and tender without veering into saccharine 
 it made my heart go ba-dump awww there were genuine feels inside i thought it was a beautiful story beautifully illustrated and even though it came out of her memories of isolation and loneliness it's not bleak - there's so much fun to be had when you have a stag 
 i definitely want to see more books from this author/illustrator with more baby seals we have in egypt this saying; 
 ""who sees the unfortunate events of others feel solace about his own unfortunates"" 
 ""lly yshwf mysfwrshnt yfynts lns thwn `lyh mysfwrshnth"" 
 so 2016 wasn't my year -est 2011- and now i'm hitting ""rock bottom""having ""a series of unfortunate events"" 
 so i said why not give this title a try 
 ""accompanied by this mysterious black cat that sat with me the whole 2 hours read"" 
 it's really dark-fun misfortune kids orphans' story 
 and a gothic villain 
 and the author himself mr lemony snicket; 
 who advises you repeatedly that this book is sad and misfortune and not with a happy endingsand please close it or return it if you can't handle all this misfortune 
 even the tv show latest adaptation tells u to just 
 look away well that's true you should stop reading this review now as welllook for something happier 
 but as our beloved mother country sayingwhich i said earlier i didn't look away 
 and that wassickly fun 
 the story 
 ------- 
 the baudelaire 3 children lost their parents their huge house and everything they own in a fire but not their huge bank account 
 mrpoe the banker is the one responsible to see them to the 'proper' guardian proper here refer to something that never happened oh he delivered them to a guardian but proper is not a suitable word to describe count olaf 
 who's has nothing to do with them but plotting to get his hand of their fortune which they even can't get their hand on it till the eldest -violet14- come of age 
 to try to get their fortune he puts them in a series of unfortunate events 
 and by the second half of the book one his first grand plan is to wed violet by deceive  
 how  how can they know the deceive how can they escape his plan without endanger their lives that's the book one for you 
 oh and no matter what do you think the author stick to his word 
 no happy endings here 
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
 the writing style 
 ------------- 
 it's really like children book the style the easy sentences and even when the author use a big or fancy word he always give the meaning of it even if it's easy in a very funny way also he does that in expressions and literature techniques as well 
 it's sarcastic and if it's really a children's bookit's the darkest one ever written 
 if you read of mr lemony snicket's real life you'll feel he's been 'forced' somehow to write a children books it's 1999 the phenomenon of harry potter was on the catching fire stage that's why the result comes like it's a satire of children books satire here means a dark fun sarcastic imitation of normal life children books 
 the creating of the lemony snicket constant commentaries through the book as a detective who investigate the baudelaire orphans' series and tell this as a story for ether very young readers or slow ones that worked as a very funny 'comic relief' amidst all the misfortune unfortunate events series 
 'comic relief' here means small funny moments that gets between more tensed or serious ones 
 well 
 that's it for a small book reviews i over talked it i guess but i really loved this absurd dark fun of 
 unfortunate events

 16 january 2017 
 to 17 january 2017 i have such fond memories of this from seeing the old movie version as a kid i never got around to reading it then so i thought i'd give it a go 
 the family togetherness and sense of adventure is all there it's just lacking musical accompaniment and sound effects it is an old 'un so the writing felt a bit stiff i'm a fan of other writers from johann david wyss' era and his grammar style falls more towards someone like james fenimore cooper than say a jane austen 
 i guess my real quibble is the lack of tension here yes certainly there is danger inherent in being stranded especially upon an island that could house unknown beasts but i never had the impression they were ever in any real trouble good old dad seemed to have things under control 
 also i felt more than a passing need to suspend disbelief at some of the family's goings on for castaways they sure were well supplied from that shipwreck well i suppose their seemingly infinite supplies of gunpowder that never spoiled were needed in order to blast away at the island's animal inhabitants honestly a more appropriate title for this would be shoot to kill a less catchy but even more precise title would be we killed a lot of animals: the story of a family stranded on an island who were never in serious danger and who - i believe it has been mentioned yet bears repeating - killed a lot of animals the way they hauled off and shot at the slightest movement in the bushes was nearly worse than some of the drunken yahoos i've hunted with 
 the swiss family robinson is a family adventure story and as such should probably be read as a family when the kids are young i don't think it's meant for us old knitpicky grumps oh what a huggable book 
 it's such a lovely heart-warming story if i had a kiddo i'd recommend this book to them right away 
 it's centered on friendship family illness and maddie's unconditional love of science although there are many themes all of them are beautifully developed no exception 
 plus it's such an original story despite the scenes and situations often found in middle grade books such as broken friendships for petty reasons and sibling fights it still feels very much honest and genuine 
 i just loved the writing and narration the inclusion of sops (standard operative procedures) entertained the hell out of me not only is it the signature of this book but it's used in a clever manner i was always looking forward to them as i was reading they're creative and meaningful to the plot 
 maddie is a relatable heroine granted it's rare to see middle schoolers this interested in science but maddie's father is a scientist and so was her grandfather so it 1 - made sense and 2 - added uniqueness to the story and her characterization i definitely think many will connect with her difficulty in making true friends 
 definitely a story not to miss on

1,comic," i absolutely loved it, and i know i'll visit this book again and again. my only sad: the alot does not make an appearance. 
 so i demand a sequel! i demand it alot! dear mr. vaughan, 
 i do not know what process you go though to produce comics like these. i do not know what dark alchemy you perform, what infernal pacts you have agreed to, what terrifying drugs you must imbibe. i have no idea what arcane rituals you must perform every day, what odd odd habits of diet and exorcize you must maintain to keep your mind limber and sparking, to write things like this. 
 i just wanted to say, whatever it is you're doing, please keep doing it. 
 sincerely, 
 pat this was so good! i held off on buying the rest of the series before i started because i wanted to make sure i liked it, and now i'm so frustrated i can't continue immediately! the art, the characters, the tone, the story--i'm loving it all. 
 more please now thank you. since the movie came out, i've found myself having to explain why watchmen is important and interesting. despite being the most revered comic book of all time, it never really entered the mainstream until the film. now, people are rushing to read it in droves, but approaching watchmen without an understanding of its history and influences means missing most of what makes it truly special. 
 the entire work is an exploration of the history and purpose of the superhero genre: how readers connect to it, and what it means philosophically. moore stretches from fond satire to outright subversion to minute allusion, encasing the once-simple genre in layers of meaning. even as he refines and compresses the genre, he also constantly pushes its boundaries. watchmen is unapologetic, unflinching, and most miraculous of all, freed from the shame which binds so many comics. 
 moore never stoops to making an entirely sympathetic character. there is no real hero, and none of the characters represents moore's own opinions. superhero comics are almost always built around wholly sympathetic, admirable characters. they represent what people wish they were, and they do the things normal people wish they could do. 
 it is immediately gratifying escapism, which many people attach themselves to, especially the meek who lead tedious, unfulfilled lives. many people also do the same thing with celebrities, idolizing them and patterning their own lives on the choices those famous people make. but in this modern age of reality tv and gossip media, we know that celebrities are not ideal people. 
 indeed, their wealth and prominence often drives them mad. while everyone else views the world from the bottom up, they view it from the top down, and this skewed perspective wreaks havoc with their morality and sense of self. moore's superheroes represent something even beyond this celebrity. not only are they on the top of the heap, but they are physically different from other human beings. their superiority is not just in their heads and pocketbooks, but in their genetics. 
 they are not meant to be sympathetic, they are meant to be human. they are as flawed and conflicted as any of us, and while we may sometimes agree with them, as often, we find them distant and unstable. 
 many people have fingered rorschach as the 'hero' of this tale, but that is as flawed as pinning satan as the hero of 'paradise lost'. following the classic fantasy of power, rorschach inflicts his morality on the world around him. but, since he is not an ideal, but a flawed human, we recognize that his one-man fascist revolution is unjustified. 
 we all feel that we see the world clearly, and everyone around us is somehow confused and mistaken. often, we cannot understand how others can possibly think they way they do. sometimes, we try to communicate, but there is often an impassable barrier between two minds: no matter how much we talk or how pure our intentions, one will never be able to convince the other. 
 we all feel the temptation to act out--if only those disagreeable people were gone, the world would be a better place. while this justification may be enough for most comic writers, moore realizes that the other guy thinks everything would be better if we were gone. rorschach lashes out because his ideas are too 'out there' and he is too socially insecure to convince anyone that he is right. he is unwilling to question himself, and so becomes a force of his own violent affirmation. 
 most who sympathize with him are like him: short-sighted and desperate, unable to communicate with or understand their fellow man. many are unwilling even to try. rorschach becomes a satire of the super hero code, which says that as long as you call someone evil, you are justified in beating him to death. this same code is also commonly adopted as foreign policy by leaders in war, which moore constantly reminds us of with references to real world politics. 
 the rest of the characters take on other aspects of violent morality, with varying levels of self-righteousness. like the british government of the 1980's, which inspired moore, or the american government of the beginning of this century, we can see that equating physical power with moral power is both flawed and dangerous. subjugating others 'for their own good' is only a justification for leaders who feel entitled to take what they can by force. 
 the only character with the power to really change the world doesn't do so. his point of view is so drastically different from the common man that he sees that resolving such petty squabbles by force won't actually solve anything. it won't put people on the same page, and will only create more conflict and inequality. dr. manhattan sees man only as a tiny, nearly insignificant part of the vast complexity of the cosmos. though he retains some of his humanity, his perspective is so remote that he sees little justification for interference, any more than you or i would crush the ants of one colony to promote the other. 
 the ending presents another example of one man trying to enforce his moral solutions upon the entire world. not only does this subvert the role of the super hero throughout comic book history, but reflects upon the political themes touched on throughout the book. man is already under the subjugation of men--they may not be superhuman, but still hold the lives of countless billions in their hands. it is no coincidence that moore shows us president nixon, a compulsive liar and paranoid delusional who ran the most powerful country in the world as he saw fit. 
 moore's strength as a writer--even more than creating flawed, human characters--is telling many different stories, which are really the same story told in different ways, all layered over each other. each story then comments on the others, presenting many views. his plots are deceptively complex, but since they all share themes, they flow one into the next with an effortlessness that marks moore as a truly sophisticated writer. 
 many readers probably read right across the top of this story, flowing smoothly from one moment to the next, and never even recognizing the bustling philosophical exploration that moves the whole thing along. the story-within-a-story 'the black freighter' winds itself through the whole of watchmen, and for moore, serves several purposes. firstly, it is another subversion of comic book tropes: moore is tapping into the history of the genre, when books about pirates, cowboys, spacemen, monsters, and teen love filled the racks next to the superhuman heroes before that variety was obliterated by the comics code (yet another authoritarian act of destruction by people who thought they were morally superior). 
 but in the world of watchmen, there are real superheroes, and they are difficult, flawed, politically motivated, and petty. so, superhero comics are unpopular in the watchmen world, because there, superheroes are fraught with political and moral complexity. these are not the requisite parts of an escapist romp. we don't have comic books about our politicians, after all. we may have political satire, but that's hardly escapist fun. 
 so, instead they read about pirates. beyond referencing the history of comics, 'the black freighter' works intertextually with watchmen. the themes and events of one follow the other, and the transitions between them create a continuous exploration of ideas. moore never breaks off his story, because even superficially unrelated scenes flow from one to the other, in a continuous, multilayered, self-referential narrative. 
 i continually stand in awe of moore's ability to connect such disparate threads. many comic authors since have tried to do the same, but from morrison to ellis to ennis, they have shown that striking that right balance is one of the hardest things an author can do. most of moore's followers end up with an unpalatable mish-mash instead of a carefully prepared and seasoned dish. 
 unlike most comic authors, moore scripted the entire layout for the artist: every panel, background object, and action. using this absolute control, moore stretched the comic book medium for all it was worth, filling every panel with references, allusions, and details which pointed to the fullness and complexity of his world. moore even creates meaning with structure, so that the size, shape, and configuration of panels tell much of the story for him. 
 one of the volumes is even mirrored, so that the first page is almost identical to the last, the second page to the second last, and so on. that most readers don't even notice this is even more remarkable. that means that moore used an extremely stylized technique so well that it didn't interfere with the story at all. 
 but therein lies the difficulty: if a reader isn't looking for it, they will probably have no idea what makes this books so original and so remarkable. this especially true if they don't know the tropes moore is subverting, or the allusive history he calls upon to contextualize his ideas. 
 while many readers enjoy the book purely on its artistic merit, the strength of the writing, and the well-paced plot, others disregard the work when they are unable to recognize what makes it revolutionary. one might as well try to read paradise lost with no knowledge of the bible, or watch looney toons without a familiarity with 1940's pop culture. 
 it is not a perfect work, but there is no such thing. moore's lead heroine is unremarkable, which moore himself has lamented. he did not feel entirely comfortable writing women at that point in his career, and the character was forced on him by the higher ups. luckily, she's not bad enough to ruin the work, and only stands out because she lacks the depth of his other characters. 
 his politics sometimes run to the anarchic, but often this is just a satire of violence and hubris. moore gives no easy answers in his grand reimagining. his interlocking stories present many thoughts, and many points of view. in the end, it is up to the reader to decide for himself who was right or wrong--as if anyone truly could be. 
 moore never insults the intelligence of his readers, and so creates a work with more depth than anyone is likely to plumb even after numerous readings. likewise, he does not want you to 'hold on for the ride', but expects that you will engage and question and try to come to terms with his work, yourself. no one is necessarily the hero or villain, and many people find themselves cowed and unsure of such an ambiguous world, just as we do with the real world. 
 watchmen is not instructional, nor is it simply a romp. this book, like all great books, is a journey that you and the author share. the work is meant to connect us to the real world, and not to let us escape from it. this is moore's greatest subversion of the superhero genre, and does even more than milton to ""justify the ways of god to man"", for many men delude themselves to godhood, yet even these gods cannot escape their fundamental humanity. 
 my suggested readings in comics this comic is so good it's starting to piss me off. 
 dear mr. vaughan, 
 you should not be able to make me cry five times in the same fucking comic. seriously. twice in two pages? this will not do. it is neither seemly nor fair. 
 please knock that shit off. 
 fondly yours, 
 pat 
 p.s. please don't knock it off. of the twenty-seven books i'd read in the gr awards semifinals, this is the only one that won in its category. so congratulations, even though i don't consider this a graphic novel as such, more like a collection of unrelated cartoons better placed in the humor category, but who's gonna split genre-hairs? 
 although i'm pretty confident i have at least 10-15 years on this cartoonist, there's still so much in this book that resonated with me. which probably reflects very poorly on me - it's one thing to still be finding your way and retaining your childish mores in your twenties, but it's a little less cute when you're ... older. 
 there are some parts of adulthood i am very good at: paying bills on time and making sure the dishes are done and the litterbox is clean and not running out of toothpaste. but then there are some other things i just can't seem to get the hang of, mostly in the realm of social fakery, like small talk and networking and climbing that social ladder. and then there are ""adult"" skills i just don't see the value of adopting, like the development of an impulse control muscle that says ""don't eat that whole box of cookies in one sitting,"" 
 or ""don't buy another stuffed animal, you old fart."" 
 and sarah andersen seems like a soulmate in those regards. 
 we are exhausted by the same things, like slow walkers, the ease of written vs. the hell of verbal communication, and the struggle of maintaining a polite and focused attention span while inwardly experiencing social anxiety and a desire to be back in the safety of one's home-cave. 
 i think i used to be an extrovert but then i just got so tired. i'd much rather hide out and be cozy, and while i'm a little regretful that i don't take advantage of all the fine cultural things new york has to offer, i feel a little ""been there, done that,"" and now i'm all old and groggy. i'm no longer young and hot and new york is pretty much tailored for the young and hot. or the rich. 
 and too often i just feel like this 
 but this book makes me feel okay about myself. it says it's okay to have serious attachments to stuffed animals 
 and a notebook addiction that is well-intentioned but haphazard 
 and it stresses the importance of coziness: 
 especially when it comes to cozy-fashion 
 i mean, right now i am wearing doraemon poupons and a julius-monkey fleece top. like a baby. 
 there are, of course, several comics pandering to booknerds, most notably 
 but the biggest adult lesson i learned from this book is: wait, you're supposed to wash your bras? 
 i do laundry once a week - i'm no scrub, but i have never ever in my life washed a bra. not even when i was a little kid living at home and someone else was doing the laundry for me. how does this even work? don't they get all misshapen and crumpled? i do not have sweaty stinky boobs, and i've never had a problem with filthy bras. so i'm going to keep living the way i been living and no one's gonna stop me. 
 this book also highlights a lot of girl-woes that made me shout, ""i know, right?"" like the way the fashion industry and the lingerie industry just don't seem to be able to work together 
 the perils of long hair 
 and the mysterious ways of tampons 
 other noteworthy fist-bumps from me to ms. andersen include her addressing: 
 -the joy of giving gifts and the crippling shyness of receiving them. 
 -the constant dwelling on stupid things one has said long after anyone else remembers them 
 -the lack of desire to spawn 
 -the shyness that comes off as rudeness 
 -how long toenail polish lasts 
 and we also both have stuffed bunnies 
 except hers is a little more alive than mine 
 so i'm totally down to be her big sister, if she is in the market for one of those. we can wave shyly at each other from across the room and then go back home to our respective pj's and our too-early cat alarm clocks. 
 i'm gonna peter pan myself well into my old-age senility, when it will once more be completely age-appropriate for me to embrace what makes me comfortable over the challenges of the world of social expectations. 
 so there. this book freaked my shit out. 
 yeah. how's that for a blurb? 
 ""this freaked my shit out."" 
 - patrick rothfuss 
 the truth is, this book is amazing. i've read a lot of great comics this last year, and out of all of them, this is the one that had the most profound emotional effect on me. 
 it's not gory, or graphic. it's... unsettling. it's creepy. it's like the darkest of the old-school faerie tales. 
 i read it at night before i was going to go to bed. and when i was done, i was too unnerved to go to sleep. i had to read something else to settle myself down first. 
 seriously. i'm 40 years old. and still this thing got to me. 
 highly *highly* recommended. i sat down to read a little of this during lunch, and ended up sitting in the restaurant for an hour after i was done eating. eventually i felt guilty and left, but my plans were shot for the afternoon, as all i could think about was finishing this book. 
 i wish there were some mechanism on goodreads to occasionally give a book more than five stars. something to indicate when you think a book is more than merely excellent. like for every 100 books you review, you earn the right to give one six-star review. 
 if such a mechanism were in place, i'd use my six-star review on this graphic novel. it was lovely and clear. it had a strong emotional impact, without being sugary or uncomfortable. it was eye-opening without being preachy or didactic. i read the whole thing in less than three hours, and i can honestly say i am better for the experience. this series continues to blow me away! loving it! great art and really cool premise, though it was a bit hard to follow at times. definitely want to continue on with this comic series, though i'm hoping volume 2 has more world building! amazing! i loved the strong, unique characters, the plot, the humor, the art, and everything else! really enjoyed this! i especially loved how relatable kamala was, and that she wasn't the typical comic book heroine. that being said, i did feel like some elements were a bit stereotypical, and while this was a good intro to the characters/world/situation, it wasn't as standout wow amazing as it could've been. i'll definitely be continuing on with this comic series, though. very much looking forward to volume 2! damn. this is probably the most profound story i've read in at least a couple of years. comic or otherwise. 
 keep in mind that this is a story about stories. about beginnings and endings. these things are close to my heart. i'd been hearing good things about this book for ages, so i finally decided to pick it up. 
 i enjoyed it, and appreciated the fact that it wasn't just another same-old superhero origin story. but if i'm going to be completely honest here. (and i always try to be completely honest) i'll also say that it didn't really thrill me, either. 
 part of the issue might be that i don't know *anything* about the original hero that the story is based on. that can make it a lot harder to get into a story. 
 but it's also fair to assume that this story didn't speak to me as strongly because the main character is a teenage muslim, and a child of immigrants. i don't *think* that's the case. i dig a lot of books with female protagonists. but i'll happily admit that it's a possibility. 
 i'd happily read more of the series. but i'm not going to run out and order them. and even if this isn't my favorite comic ever, i'm really glad it exists. i have a bunch of comics i love. i'm a straight white guy. there's a ton of media tailor made to please me. 
 the fact that this comic speaks to a lot of other people's interests and experiences instead of mine? that doesn't hurt me at all. in fact, it delights me. i love it. huzzah for that. let's do it ten times. let's do it forever. hilarious, touching, with beautiful art and an interesting ending. 
 great for fans of vicious by v.e. schwab and rainbow rowell's fangirl (because the simon snow vibes were strong, let's be real) a question that's been bothering me all morning is whether i have a moral right not to order a t-shirt with an offensive cartoon of the prophet muhammad (pbuh) and start wearing it. until yesterday, i would not have dreamed of doing such a thing, which would have been gratuitously offensive to all my muslim friends. but now, i wonder if i'm only refraining from showing solidarity with the dead cartoonists because i'm afraid someone will shoot me. 
 my intuitions are confused. not doing something out of politeness and respect for other people's religious feelings is clearly right. but not doing it out of craven cowardice is clearly wrong. which principle applies here? i hope some experts on ethical philosophy are preparing an answer. 
 _________________________ 
 the comment thread has already become very long, so may i just briefly summarize my main response. 
 the suggestion i make here was inspired by the many public readings of the satanic verses held after the fatwa was issued against salman rushdie. the purpose of those readings was to show solidarity with rushdie and demonstrate belief in the freedom of speech. without them, the publisher might well have decided that rushdie's book was too hot to handle, establishing an extremely dangerous precedent. it was generally held afterwards that the public readings had been a good thing. 
 in this case, people have also been quick to agree on the importance of solidarity. everywhere you look, you find the phrase je suis charlie. but it seems to me that this is quite different from the response to the rushdie case. when you hold up a sign saying je suis charlie, you are not really taking any risk, since you are not repeating the offensive material. i'm just being logical here: the real way to say je suis charlie is to repeat one of the cartoons that got them firebombed and then shot down in cold blood. like this one. 
 for people who don't read french, it really is quite funny. the title charlie hebdo at the top is replaced by sharia hebdo. the speech bubble says ""a hundred lashes if you don't die laughing"". 
 _________________________ 
 wastrel reminds me that charlie hebdo didn't just offend muslims. after a couple of minutes of searching, i found the following splendidly tasteless cover: 
 it took me a little while to figure it out, but apparently the reference is to a mgr. vingt-trois, who had made some outspoken comments against gay marriage. the headline says ""mgr vingt-trois has three daddies"" (i am guessing this may allude to the children's book jennifer has two daddies), and the speech bubbles say ""the father"", ""the son"" and ""the holy ghost"". [yann in #307 says this is not quite right: the cover refers to a heated public debate on adoption by homosexual couples, where the catholics who were campaigning against it used the slogan ""un papa et une maman"" (""one daddy and one mommy"")] 
 or if you're looking for outrageous and inappropriate anti-israeli humor: 
 the headline says ""already christmas in palestine"". the arrow pointing left says ""costume for israeli child"". the arrow pointing right says ""costume for palestinian child"". 
 but this even more outrageous cover, which has been widely reprinted, is not genuine ch: it's a parody by joe le corbeau, an associate of the notorious racist comedian dieudonne. i was fooled, as were many newspapers. [thank you again yann for catching this!] 
 speech bubble: ""1 million reduction on the 6, in exchange for palestine!"" 
 _________________________ 
 people who want to see more examples of charlie hebdo covers should look at yann's review. these guys were really funny and disrespectful, about everything: the muslims, yes, but at least as much the israelis, the us, the russians, the french, the germans, the extreme right, the catholic church, and pretty much anything else you can think of. 
 i'm very sorry that they had to be killed in this horrible way before i ever got around to looking at their work. it should have been easier to get my attention. 
 _________________________ 
 the cover for the latest issue, which is due out tomorrow: 
 ""all is forgiven""you gotta hand it to them, these guys really have a sense of humor. 
 _________________________ 
 even though the new issue is already out in france, it won't be on sale here until tomorrow. the local papers can talk about nothing else. the print run has been increased twice, from one million to three million and then to five million, and supply is still not meeting demand. people in paris are queuing up outside the newsagents before they open, and a few minutes later every copy has been sold. 
 tribune de geneve reproduces one of the cartoons on its front page. below, a crowd of robot-like commuters are all intently reading their copies of charlie hebdo. above, the four murdered cartoonists sit on a cloud and remark c'est dur d'etre aime par des cons (""it's hard to be loved by idiots""). this is a reference to one of ch's most famous covers, where the prophet muhammad (pbuh), weeping, is saying the same thing. 
 _________________________ 
 you can't get copies here for love or money, though admittedly i haven't yet explored the first alternative. according to the ever-reliable tribune, the station newsstand was all sold out by 5.30 am. 
 well, we live right next door to la gare de cornavin - it's literally a two minute walk. i will try getting up very early tomorrow morning. if necessary i will propose to the woman behind the counter.

 i finally managed to obtain a copy of the survivor's number and have been looking at it this evening. it's very moving. 
 here was the bit i liked most, which doesn't seem to have been widely remarked on. it's a paragraph from the tribute piece by zineb el rhazoui, the woman who wrote the text for the wonderful 
 vie de mahomet 
 : 
 allah akbar! 
 before they executed the team, the killers shouted twice ""god is great!"" well, no, fuckwits. if he really existed, do you think he would have let your terminal stupidity extinguish the brilliant minds of wolinski, cabu, honore, charb, tignous, bernard maris, elsa cayat and mustapha ourrad? allah akbar! was charb's war-cry, the greeting he used in mails and smss. ""allah akbar! do you think you could have your copy ready for tomorrow?"" one day, i remember we were teasing him at the office: ""charb, stop yelling that, the day they arrive to kill you we won't know if it's a joke!"" and they did arrive. at charlie, we knew that humor was something very serious. 
 [my translation]_________________________ 
 i had never even heard of nahed hattar until i read just now that he had been murdered for publishing what certain islamic militants considered to be a blasphemous cartoon. to save you the trouble of going to google image search, here it is. 
 apparently the title is ""the god of daesh""; haider (messages 1527 and 1529) has kindly provided a translation. god starts by addressing the bearded gentleman in bed with the two babes, saying ""good evening abu saleh, do you need anything?"" 
 abu saleh replies (first speech bubble) ""yes o lord, bring me a cup of wine, and tell gabriel to bring me some cashews, then send a boy to clean the floor, and take out the empty dishes with you."" he adds (second speech bubble) ""and don't forget to build a door in this tent so next time you can knock before you come in, glory be to you!"" 
 that is really funny. i have a book i wrote on goodreads! wooot! so exciting! 
 is it douchy of me to rate it 5 stars? ah, whatever :) 
 this is released early december! i wish these could be like a thousand pages long ''i can't have a kid following me around all day.'' 
 ''i'm not a kid. i'm a shark.'' 
 pouahaha. what a story! what witty dialogs! filled with humour, adventure, magic and friendship, it will certainly charm and entertain the hell out of you. this title used to be a dnf of mine, before i decided to give it a second shot. glad i did! what made me stop reading it the first time around was the graphics, because this is a style that never appealed to me, but truth is, it just grows on you, as do the characters and every other element. 
 nimona, huge bear hugs to you. ballister, you've got my admiration. goldenloin, i want your hair. noelle stevenson, i wish you'd write a sequel or an happy-ever-after epilogue. i want to see ballister & goldenloin kiss. 
 i loved it. lovely and amazing. 
 re-read this in may 2016 with my little son. 
 my thoughts? 
 if i could buy everyone in america a copy of this book, i would. i feel like this is something i will go back to and reread a few times, but i am slightly terrified to do so... first off, let's be clear, i'm a big soppy fan of gaiman's work. 
 secondly, i've read the sandman series several times before. so this is more a record of my fond re-reading and musing about this story rather than some sort of objective review. 
 but if you've read any of my other reviews, that won't come as a surprise. 
 i think it's been a full ten years since the last time i've read this series. and, given that my memory is, well... to put it plainly quite shit, i get to experience the series with a fairly fresh set of eyes at this point. 
 the first thing that i notice is that the art is different that i remember. i remember it being darker and grittier. more real and more surreal at the same time. 
 but that, i'm expecting, is the lens of corrective memory at play. in reality, the art seems more (for lack of a better word) cartoony. the colors are bolder, more garish than i remember. 
 note: i had the same experience recently when i re-read watchmen. so i'm suspecting this is an issue with me, rather than the comic. or perhaps i'm remembering the later parts of the comic more vividly. 
 the other thing i'm surprised to see is that both john constantine and a few members of the dc cannon show up in this first book. mostly just brief walk-ons, but martian manhunter is there, and we see arkham asylum and the scarecrow. 
 these things don't detract from the story. i can say that for a fact, because on my earlier reads when i hadn't read many comics, so i didn't know who many of those characters were. but i have to say, reading through this time they kinda surprised me. 
 you see, i think of the sandman series as being... well... kinda self-contained. that's not the right way of putting it really, as the story is hugely vast. it's sprawling and lovely and mythically rich. 
 i guess what i'm saying here is that while it seems perfectly natural that sandman exists in the same world as odin and puck and eurydice, having batman in that cosmology, even by association, feels really odd to me. and the more i think of it, it's strangely off-putting. 
 that said, i'm fairly certain these dc cameos were early things, and weren't repeated extensively throughout the rest of the series. 
 as for this first book, it makes for both a great story in itself, and a great start to the larger series. that's not a common thing. 
 is it worth your time? 
 absolutely. 
 i don't care if you don't read comics, you should read this series. 
 and if you *do* read comics, you cannot consider yourself well-read until you have sandman under your belt. seriously. i didn't read this until last year. i saw the film about six months later. i'm a new convert still radiant with that 'just converted' glow. 
 along with the sandman graphic novels this is my favourite work in the medium (zenith and preacher get honourable mentions). watchmen wins over all of the other candidates in ambition. this is a work of vast ambition. it doesn't deliver on every level, it isn't perfect, but it contains so much that succeeds, and comes so close to fulfilling its promises that it would be churlish to mention any failings. 
 alan moore is a great writer. he's not a great writer for comics, he's a great writer period, who happens to have made the graphic novel his medium. watchmen is at times literary, funny, erudite, tragic, exciting, intriguing... it's written for intelligent grown-up readers. 
 the plot sprawls, it's convoluted, it spans generations and a large cast. what keeps it together are the deeply personal stories on various scales. its scope was what kept it from the big screen for so long, and in truth the movie (whilst good fun and well done, i thought) is just a 2d projection of this complex multi-dimensional work. that same complexity is stopping me from doing it justice in this short review. rather than try i'm just going to back off the grandiose praise and return to the punchline: 
 this is a fun read. it's exciting. the artwork rocks. it's as deep as that hole alice fell down, but you never notice you're falling. pick it up. read it with pride. if someone sneers at you for reading a comic-book... hit them with it. it's nice and fat!

 .. remember, remember the fifth of november... 
 this tpb edition collects the original 10 comic book issues, then divided in the graphic novel in three chapters. 
 creative team: 
 writer: alan moore 
 illustrator: david lloyd 
 valiant vericity 
 remember, remember! the fifth of november, the gunpowder treason and plot; i know of no reason why the gunpowder treason should ever be forgot! 
 it's one of the first sentences that came to mind when you think about the masterpiece by alan moore & david lloyd. and certainly something quite easy to remember each year on the mentioned date. 
 however, the most powerful quote that sticks to my mind is... 
 people should not be afraid of their governments. governments should be afraid of their people. 
 that quote resumes the power of this story. 
 story of one man. 
 one man who can be everybody. 
 everybody is special. everybody. everybody is a hero, a lover, a fool, a villain, everybody. everybody has their story to tell... 
 and the story of ""v"" is one very powerful to tell... 
 good evening, london. i thought it time we had a little talk. are you sitting comfortably? then i'll begin... 
 vigorous vocality 
 this is my favorite graphic novel ever! 
 one of the first impacts when i read reading this graphic novel the first time, it was when i realized that you don't start to read in the beginning of the story. 
 no, the plan of ""v"" is so carefully crafted that when the government think that he started, he is already finishing it. 
 v? you're almost finished, aren't you? 
 it's very likely that by now, you may have watched the film and it's a very good adaptation. i liked it a lot and it's one of my favorite movies. are there differences? oh, yes! but, honestly, as a hardcore alan moore's fan, i think that the changes are good thinking that film is a different format than comic book and therefore, some things can be changed and still delivering the same powerful message. 
 there's no flesh or blood within this cloak to kill. there's only an idea. ideas are bulletproof. 
 however, if you are a truly v for vendetta's fan, like me, you must read the graphic novel at some point, or you will be missing a lot. 
 vehement vitalism 
 knowledge, like air, is vital to life. like air, no one should be denied it. 
 it's a wonderful joy to watch how alan moore put everywhere the letter ""v"", in the titles of the chapters just to mention an example. 
 also, david lloyd is a very creative partner of moore, making into art many original concepts like a chapter made entirely in the form a music sheet. 
 wonderful concepts that you only can get in the format of a graphic novel. 
 vendetta validity 
 if i take off that mask, something will go away forever, be diminished because whoever you are isn't as big as the idea of you. 
 i am a huge fan of alan moore's work and i have the luck to find a lot of his work, not only the quite known examples like watchmen and this very graphic novel v for vendetta but also his entire runs of swamp thing, top ten, tom strong, promethea, fashion beast, along with great issues like for the man who has everything, the killing joke, whatever happened with the man of tomorrow, etc... 
 ...and i loved to read everything and i have to say that my favorite work by alan moore is this graphic novel v for vendetta. 
 i think the strongest issue that convince me to realize that v for vendetta is my own personal favorite graphic novel but also my own personal favorite work by alan moore is because it's that each little detail on the story was so carefully done, so carefully thought, so carefully presented. 
 and that's the beautiful irony of all. 
 since this is a story about chaos, but it's done with a precision where nothing is left to chance. everything is where that's supposed to be. no more or less than needed to tell the story. 
 and threrefore, my own personal opinion is that this is his masterpiece in the middle of an universe of masterpieces written by alan moore. 
 not only is a strong political story but also an impressive artwork. 
 also, the terrorist known as ""v"" is one of the best characters ever made in literature. 
 what was done to me created me. it's a basic principle of the universe that every action will create an equal and opposing reaction. 
 that will be all. you may return to your labors. 
 england prevails. that was... kind of odd. i tried to go into it with low expectations and not compare it with the lunar chronicles books since it's a different format! but most of the characters didn't seem like themselves (especially thorne) and the tone was drastically different. 
 i did love how well iko's personality came through in her narration! and it was fun to see familiar characters together again (except i really wasn't huge on thorne here. he turned into a wimpy tween boy and went from being my favorite character to my least favorite). there's not much with scarlet, kai, or wolf, but they do come in at the end. most of the plot focuses on cinder getting ready to abdicate her throne to form a republic while iko hunts down rogue lunar special operatives and meets up with cress & thorne. i adore iko and wanted to see more of her with kinney, so that was a fun part! and i really did love the parts with cinder. 
 i've told a lot of adults and grandparents to read the lunar chronicles because they're fun for all ages, but this book definitely felt like i was too old for the target audience at times. a lot of scenes were either cringeworthy or just... not the same characters?? and i really wasn't that big on the illustrations, either. 
 so i think this will be really fun for the right audience, but it's not something i'd recommend for everyone who loved the lunar chronicles. the story and characters aren't a very strong continuation of the book series -- this graphic novel is kind of doing its own thing now. and that's not bad! i'm just pretty neutral on it overall. this was so awesome, it was like reading the movie!!! a fan gave this to me as a gift at nerdcon this past weekend. i didn't know it existed until then. 
 apparently it's based off a jonathan coulton song. but despite the fact that i'm a coulton fan, i'd never heard it. still, i wasn't terribly surprised. i tend to live under a heavy rock most of the time. 
 despite not knowing the song it was based on, i loved the book. i read it in a restaurant the day after the convention and got all teary. i tried to cover this up by pretending that i was really emotionally involved in my cobb salad, but i don't think it worked. 
 it's a really great book, and when i got done i read it to my two little boys. (and got teary again) they loved it and wanted to hear it a second time. 
 so i read it to them again. 
 * * * 
 update: tonight (one day after our initial reading) i found my older boy (6) reading this book to himself. then my littlest boy (2) carried it over to me and said, ""read daddy read daddy read."" 
 so yeah. it's a hit. i rarely write gr reviews, but i almost didn't pick this up because of some of the reviews i've seen, so i wanted to add my five stars. 
 this is a quiet book. much of the action is observed rather than experienced by the protagonists, but the impact it has on them is deeply felt. if you're looking for grand resolutions or ""boy did i learn my lesson"" closure, you won't find it here. and that's exactly as it should be. 
 this one summer beautifully and poignantly captures a particular moment in girlhood when we begin to understand the way the world sees women and begin to make our own judgments about how we wish to be perceived ourselves. watching rose struggle with the idea of wanting to be a ""cool girl,"" and of what it means to be seen as a ""bad girl"" or ""slut"" isn't comfortable, but if feels wholly real. the way she and windy soak up the opinions and behaviors of those around them, the way they take those messages into themselves, and their burgeoning self-consciousness as they leave childhood behind is honestly and painfully drawn, but never skews preachy. (and the idea that this book in any way condones slut shaming is utterly absurd.) f*cking fabulous. more like 4.5 stars. really enjoying this series! it just keeps getting better and better! this question is a reaction to the sight of this: 
 but it could be asked in response to seeing many of the other creatures appearing in this story. 
 it's got unicorn people 
 torsoless sex workers 
 teevee-head people 
 seahorse people 
 and ... this 
 the story centers around a second timeless question: 
 why, these two assholes, that's who: 
 these incredibly attractive characters are supposed to hate each other, due to the longstanding war between their respective peoples, but they fall in love in that romantical star-crossed way; a classic tale of 'he's got horns, she's got wings,' and they make a baby together, where all of the grand beauty of childbirth is depicted. 
 and 
 despite how really freaking beautiful they are, their love is considered treason, and the baby an abomination in the eyes of both their people, so the family is forced to flee to the furthest corners of the galaxy, pursued by a number of bounty hunters/assassins and also a lie-detector cat 
 the third question is why did i wait so long to read this? it had been recommended to me a number of times by a number of people, and i'd always kept it in the back of my mind to read ""someday,"" but if i'd known it would be this good, i would have kicked myself in the ass towards it a long time ago. 
 this is a triumph of art, story, and concept, it's funny as hell, and i love the characters - not just our two protagonists, but even those who are in pursuit of them. which results in very conflicted loyalties, but it's one of the strengths of this story - that it's not all black/white, good/evil, or in the words of the book: some monsters are worse than others.. 
 there's great character development and worldbuilding and i'm going to try to pace myself with reading these, so i don't end up with another chew situation on my hands, where i plow through 10 books and then have to endure the agony of waiting for my next fix. (i say that, but i've already read the second one and bought the third, and there's only five so far, so i will likely break this vow) 
 in any event, i'm hooked. 
 marko and alana 4eva! i'm just saying. i would write the hell out of a rick and morty story.... morality is a fickle bitch. 
 this is, simply put, iconic. when any one mentions comics/graphic novels the first thought that enters is an image of the watchmen. i think there is a strong reason for it. it made me question morality on a scale rarely seen in fiction. indeed, when considering the characters it is incredibly hard to consider any of them truly good or truly bad. they are simply people who are convinced that they are right. 
 take rorschach, he follows the law to the very letter, but never stops to consider, for a single moment, that there are actually problems with the law; yes, he is violent, but his unique form of vigilante justice is an embodiment of the law's order. he works outside the law to bring the law in a strange sort of way. then is he not worthy of the justice he administers? does he go too far? is he, too, not worthy of punishment? these are hard questions to answer because there are no real answers. there is simply opinion and debate; it all depends on how you view the world. one thing remains certain though, the characters in here are so devastatingly flawed. 
 on the other hand, you have ozymandias who looks at the big picture. he sees the world for what it is, and tries to plan accordingly. except, unlike rorschach he attempts to tackle the bigger problems. to many, he is simply the villain. in reality he is as obscurely heroic as rorschach and just as morally grey. who has the right to sacrifice life? who has the right to dictate people and make such a monumental decision? well, nobody really. yet, ozymandias' actions, essentially, save the world. who can question his results? his methods are clearly debatable, though it was the only route open to him. there is simply no quantifiable right or wrong in this world; there is only neutrality and hypocrisy. 
 this is where the self-actualised comedian comes in. unlike rorschach, he is fully aware of his faults and corruptness. unlike ozymandias, he perceived that the world has no hope. so, what does he do? he embraces himself and indulges in his own overbearing personality. he knows what he is, and what he reflects, so he relishes in his own nature. he offers no guilt and feels no remorse: he simply doesn't care about anything or anyone. in this he is more neutral than any other character; he isn't in denial; he isn't convinced he is right: he just knows that the world is, essentially, doomed. 
 so, why not enjoy it? it's all a joke, after all. right? 
 there are so many conflicting and self-defeating morals in here. never before have i read something in which so many people have been wrong, but at the same time so absolutely right. then there is jon, the so called god of america, the supreme dr manhattan. he is something else entirely. he could have changed everything. his power was practically limitless, but he barely lifted a finger until the last possible moment. and the pointing of that finger was an action that was both terrible and completely necessary. the answer became clear as to the question of his inaction: why should he bother with man? the comedian got to him in this; he saw something in humanity that wasn't worth saving. rorschach saw it too, but he still tried to salvage the remnants of society through brutalising the brutalisers. dr manhattan, however, was simply too complex and too important to waste his time on the common man. he came through in the end though, surprisingly. well, kind of. i thought he'd watch the world burn, but humanity did have another protector albeit one who committed necessary evils. 
 this was such a great piece of fiction; i don't think i could ever do it justice in a review. parts of this felt too intricate to put into words. this is a complete subversion of the entire genre and a full questioning of the flawed, and hypocritical, nature of humankind. it is a piece of work that will, simply put, never be forgotten by those that have experienced its mortifying splendour. this is the first comic book i've seriously considered to be great; it has become a gateway for me to explore the comic book universe that i've barely touched in the past. 
 so i ask you this: what comic book should i read next? can any other comic really compare to this? updated review: 
 *giggle snorts* 
 rereading is often a humbling experience . . . i've been forced to admit that my memory isn't what it once was, and never is that more apparent then after a reread. *kicks aluminum can* 
 i won't bore you with all the things i'd forgotten, but there were a few things that made a bigger impact this time around: 
 how does one bind a god to a person? 
 and this: 
 1. who was the first arcanic lord? 
 2. who is the other potential host? 
 also, that other old god is after maika b/c she's some kind of superior host, so does that mean every old god that slithers out of their cage is going to be after her as well?

 4.5 stars 
 one of the things i'm discovering that i love about graphic novels is the way they hit the ground running. the creators don't toy with you the way writers of traditional books sometimes do--they don't have the time to draw out anything beyond the most important secrets. 
 monstress, for example, opens with a slave auction, and the inquiries made about lot 819 reveal the specific brand of prejudice that governs this world. you learn of a war that seems to have ended, while the thriving slave trade continues to fan the flames of hate. 
 there's no guesswork, and any confusion about terminology resolves itself quickly. 
 i friggin' love it. 
 our heroine, maika halfwolf, is the girl currently up for bid, but (once again) it quickly becomes obvious that she's only there b/c she wants to be. 
 yep. you read that correctly: dollface wants to be auctioned off like livestock. and not only that, she's banking on the cumaea, a witchy faction of humans, crashing the shindig and claiming the arcanics, a race of beings with natural magic, for themselves. 
 dun dun dunnnnnn . . . for research purposes . . . o.o 
 just b/c graphic novels tend to be more straightforward than their picture-free counterparts, doesn't mean they aren't twisty. 
 maika, you see, is looking for information. 
 before the war ended, something happened (was done?) to her . . . something that has recently begun to affect her in ways she can't control. it's made her dangerous, and she's desperate for answers. 
 along the way, she picks up a two-tailed sasshole of a cat, a girl child with a fox tail, and an angry dialogue with the thing that plagues her. 
 every aspect of monstress drew me in--the characters, the world-building, the plot, all of it. everything else became a distraction to be ignored. i didn't give any thought to the why of it, as i tore through the beautifully illustrated pages, but at the end of the first volume, liu wrote a letter about her intent when she began this series: 
 . . . the root of my desire . . . was to tell a story about what it means to be a survivor. a survivor, not just of a cataclysmic war, but of racial conflict and its antecedent: hatred. and to confront the question: how does one whom history has made a monster, escape her monstrosity? how does one overcome the monstrousness of others without succumbing to a rising monstrousness within? 
 all i can say is, well done, lady. well. done. 
 monstress by marjorie m. liu is the first collection (volumes 1 - 6) of her new graphic novel series that is part steampunk, part fantasy, and all awesome. maika's struggle to control the monster inside her is inspiring to watch, b/c that's what it was: a struggle. but surrender is a concept she threatens to rip out of herself every time it whispers about the easier path, and as she slowly gains the upper hand, you can't help but sing ""all i do is win"" under your breath, b/c she'd rather die than quit. highly recommended. oooh, goodreads choice awards semifinalist for best graphic novel! what will happen? 
 this is both very similar to and very different from adulthood is a myth. 
 thematically, much of the same ground is covered: procrastination, social awkwardness, the joy of comfortable clothes, the irritants that go along with being female, self image, and the bullying inner voice we all have that keeps our ego in check. 
 however, while adulthood was a collection of unrelated cartoons (and not a graphic novel, goodreads), this one contains some longer-form pieces where we get more insight into what makes sarah andersen tick, which makes it a good companion book to introvert doodles: an illustrated collection of life's awkward moments, as both address the difficulties the authors have with the world's expectations of being a social person to someone who is not naturally that way inclined, and how much human interactions can suck. 
 and as honest and laudable as i don't know how to be a person was, i'm much more drawn to one of the other long-form pieces called sadie (how i learned to get over myself and love cats), which is about how she went from being alienated by the internet's catcentric obsession: 
 to accidentally becoming a crazy cat lady like the rest of us through the fuzzy mind-control of a loaner-cat named sadie. 
 and now she is one of us 
 well done, sadie! more bodies for the calvary! 
 as with adulthood, there are plenty of scenarios very familiar to my own experiences. some that i think are true for many: 
 some that i know are familiar to all the ladies out there: 
 and some that fall into the ""i thought i was the only one!!"" category: 
 there's also some nice giggle-pokery at insufferable people 
 and, while i understand it is not the point she is making, i am interpreting this to be a bold anti-bird stance, which you know i'm on board with 
 so, another fun and funny collection which only strengthens my resolve to be sarah andersen's bestie. 
 sarraahhhhhh.... come to maaaaaaggie!! 
 although this will probably not be tolerated. 
 *************************************************** 
 i did not turn my computer on once during the holiday weekend. and it felt great, but also very stressful. so when i saw the first cartoon in this collection, my heart recognized a kindred spirit: 
 thank you for putting my feelings into pictures, sarah andersen! 
 full review to come 
 ******************************** 
 someone plz gimmie a heads-up if this comes onto netgalley!! i bought this set for my boys a few christmasses back - but really i bought it for me. 
 i've read the entire thing a few pages at a time over the course of a some months and i was sad to come to the last wonderfully bound hard cover. 
 although i was sad to reach the end i also applaud bill watterson for knowing the power in ending something. he quit while he was ahead and left us something golden. it would lessen the work if he had carried on past the point the fire left him, repeating old themes too many times, and forcing us to watch as the life leached out of these beloved characters - perhaps even passing the torch on to contracted writers to continue milking the cash cow ad infinitum. but he didn't. thanks bill. 
 calvin and hobbs captures a type of magic. the humour dances between many levels, brilliant visual comedy, erudite observation, poignant insight, laugh out loud slap-stick, and just damn feel-good stuff that touches everyone who has really lived. 
 i fell into calvin and hobbes' world in my 30s and intend to keep dipping back in every time life gets me down. 
 go try it.

 . goosebumps. full of them. reading this horror filled graphic novel during night-time turned out to be a terrifying idea. yet, i couldn't stop reading. it was captivating. i don't think i've even noted a single thing of my environment while reading it; there was only the book and i. 
 there were five short stories in this book. all of them contained a spooky or completely frightening plot that will keep you on the edge. the author also managed to include suspense in the atmosphere. however scary the story or characters might have appeared, there was no possibility for me to interrupt my own reading. the stories were short which means that never was i bored or waiting for something interesting to happen. it's not often that i take the time to read and admire graphic novels and there are multiple styles of drawings that i am still not used to, but this is one i found uniquely beautiful and would gladly see more of. 
 the writing was simplistic but, sincerely, it worked with every single thing. plus, it is really on the illustrations - which were amazingly vivid and arresting too - that i was concentrated on and did not, as i usually do, have the reflex to observe and wonder if the author used repetition as well as some figures of speech from time to time. 
 my own personal favorite was 'a lady's hands are cold' since, at first, i thought it to be a retelling of 'bluebeard' and was curious to see which path the story and main character will take. plus, the author noticeably surpassed herself with the graphics in that short story in question. 
 it is true that i found this graphic novel to be one of the best i have ever read, for how monopolized by it i was the whole reading time, but there is something that displeased me inside it: every short story ended on a cliffhanger. now, that was frustrating. at first, i thought maybe i was missing something but then it happened again. and again. every time. maybe some will not mind it, but by how dark the endings were, i did not approve of the hypotheses my mind was making for the characters. 
 this is one graphic novel i highly recommend to every fan of dark fairy tales and graphic novels with eerie ambiences. a truly too short for my liking book, but impressive nonetheless. 
 ps. how am i ever going to be able to sleep tonight? i have to get my head off worms, wolves, ghosts, hair-raising monsters hiding under the bed... friendship to the max! fun and charming with a solid story and fantastic art! i want more! go to this now!!!

 i don't laugh at books much. don't get me wrong, i am not averse to the emotion humans call ""happiness."" sometimes i will find myself smiling at an amusing book. i have been known to chuckle, even. but this book ripped out my funny bone and started tickling me with it. not only did i lol, i was crying with laughter by page four. page four! i even took a picture of my laughter-tears as proof which i intended to use in this review, but then i figured the internet had enough pictures of me already, so that one will just be for me. 
 but i will tell you that page four was not the end of my laughter-response. this book made me indescribably happy, much more than the typical ""messy art autobiography"" you find cluttering up the humor section. along withlet's pretend this never happened: a mostly true memoir, this is a book that finally understands what it's going to take to make me laugh. 
 for example, every single time she drew a dog, i fell in love a little. these are among the best dog drawings ever. 
 if that's not a perfect trip into the mind of a dog, i don't know what is. 
 one more: 
 holy hell, but that's comedy gold. 
 there are other, non-dog-related treasures; in particular the ""god of cake"" story and the goose story, but i will leave you to discover those for yourself. i know i have said in other reviews of internet-sensations-turned-book that i was glad to learn of the blog or site or whatever through the book, but i never actually visited them after my revelation, even if i really enjoyed the book. maybe once or twice, but then i would get distracted by other things and never follow through. but with this one, i am going to do the unprecedented. are you ready? for those of you who know me and my allergy to ""doing new things"" or even ""doing things like normal, modern people do"" like owning a cellphone, this is going to blow your minds. i am going to ""follow"" a blog, as the kids say. and there. i have just done it. i think. i don't know what all these buttons mean, but i am fairly confident that i have just joined the ranks of the modern world. brrrr, it's chilly. 
 speaking of chilly, i will leave you with allie brosh's take on a dog in the snow: 
 i love her. always. i'm always willing to pick up an indie comic, especially one written by a name i recognize. this one did not disappoint. 
 it's funny at times, sweet at times, pleasantly subversive without being heavy-handed or preachy. 
 i'm reading through it with my little boy right now, and he's enjoying it too.... hilarious and charming and relatable! i absolutely loved the art style and the humor--it's a beautiful book that had me laughing out loud throughout. the dynamic between the narrator and the main character was something i'd never seen before, but it thought it was brilliant! there were some aspects of the plot/worldbuilding that weren't fully developed, but if you can just go along with it, this is pretty close to perfect. great art, great story, great characters, great humor. 
 so, to recap: this was great. if you need a graphic novel recommendation, this. read this. i haven't read anything else by bryan lee o'malley yet, but i will definitely be checking out the scott pilgrim series asap. this book ripped out my heart and showed it to me. several times. my assistant introduced me to this book, and i immediately fell in love. 
 oh allie brosh, where have you been all my life? 
 oh. you were on the internet. and apparently all the cool kids have known about you for ages. 
 here's a link to her website just in case you've been living under a rock like me: 
 http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com/ 
 go and read some. 
 you can thank me later. i'm impressed at how well this comic manages to maintain the overall tone of the show. that's something i don't often see when a story tries to transition into a different medium.... more like 3.5 stars. i thought the concept was really cool and interesting, and i loved the art style, but i wasn't a huge fan of the characters. i didn't dislike them, i just didn't particularly like them. i am still interested in continuing this series though, because i did enjoy it, and i do really want to see what else happens with this premise. i loved this! it consistently had me laughing so hard i was almost crying. i've been a huge fan of allie's blog for years, and really the only reason i didn't give this 5 stars is because i'd already read quite a few of the ""chapters"". i still really recommend this though, both to those who are new to allie's work and those already following her. it's wonderful! one more to go :) i loved the art style, but the story didn't wow me as much as i was expecting. review to come, but man, am i loving this series! 
 okay, time for a real review! 
 it's hard to know where to begin.... 
 this series is all told from the pov of a girl, detailing the events and adventures of her baby-years and before, including the romantic forbidden love between her parents. 
 it was not, however, love at first sight. 
 but it's not all lovey-dovey stuff, nor even lovey-punchy-with-a-rifle stuff. there's also ... this 
 and how much do i love alana? not only for her dry wit 
 but also for her enthusiasm about books! well, okay, one book in particular. but still, it's adorable, especially because of this familiar scenario where you're talking about a book you love and your excitement gets in the way of your powers of articulation and you get this reaction to your blathering: 
 been there, my friends... 
 but also deep in my heart is lying cat 
 nooooo! no killing lying cat! lying cat is for snuggling! 
 there was much peril for lying cat in this volume. at one point i made an audible squeak. not even embarrassed about it. 
 i want my own lying cat. i also want these things 
 anyway, an excellent second part to a series that is quickly taking over my life and my heartspace. 
 you're welcome, book! so glad to be a part of this journey! woah. i mean, woah. there are so many things to love about this comic. the plot, the atmosphere, the characters, the action, the magic... those things... oh my. what i've seen so far impressed me, grandly, and if it weren't because i highly wanted to review this book right away, i would be right this moment halfway through the second volume. goddamn cliffhanger. loved it. 
 now, this comic is composed of so many elements that i never dreamed i would one day come to mightily admire, such as monsters, weird chimeras/creatures, a futuristic or alternative setting and world and killings everywhere and all the time. it just works. the story follows not only the main characters with their baby but others - such as their pursuers - as well. there's not a single uninteresting moment. it's fast-paced, it's imaginative, creative, amazingly drawn and there's one hell of a love story inside it! 
 but it's not only that. it's not only a love story or one about war and its consequences. i see something big coming, something important. i can feel it, and you'll feel it too. i'm positive the soldiers, with the help of some allies, will save the world. oops, huge spoiler if i'm right ;) oooh, goodreads choice awards semifinalist for best graphic novel! what will happen? 
 the sads shouldn't have hit me as hard as they did here, since i'd already read more than half of this volume in its single-issue installments, thanks to greg's generous indulgence of my impatience; presenting me with issues #37-40 back in november. i thought i was prepared for anything this book had to throw at me, but dammmit - issues #41 & #42 had their own griefs in store. seriously - will these people (and assorted creatures) ever catch a break? this is practically a thomas hardy-level escalation of tragedy, and even though that's not what she's talking about here, i had to laugh at this: 
 because this storyline is indeed, ""hardy as shit,"" and this was basically me the whole way through: 
 with a little 
 'i can't take any more scares sorrows!' thrown in. 
 obviously, i am going to avoid spoilerses, including spoilerses for previous volumes, but apart from all the heartache, this volume is full of the series' signature brand of ready-for-tattooing epigrams: 
 adult content: 
 and the parade of old friends, new friends, dead friends, and soon-to-be-dead friends that have made this such an addictive journey, and totally worth all the howling despair, no lie. 
 plus, we get to witness hazel's first kiss in all its bittersweet glory: 
 it's spectacularly gutting, and i loved every minute of it. okay, except for robot-peen. that's still gross. 
 and i am going to try really hard to wait for the next collected book to come out, instead of giving in to the temptation of the single issues that are too short to really satisfy my intense cravings. oh, wait - do you have something to say? 
 good, didn't think so. 
 ********************************************** 
 my goddamned heart. 
 full review to come a couple weeks ago, i read and reviewed chester brown's 
 paying for it 
 , a book singularly concerned with separating love from sex. brown forwards the idea that fewer problems arise if we segregate sex as completely as we can from the relational sphere. he does this to such an extent that he proposes that sex is a pleasure best paid for and made entirely transactional. it's not spoiling anything to say that brown, as he represents himself in the book, is more wholly concerned with sex than he is with relationship. despite the author's protestations, readers will almost certainly feel some sorrow for him as he shows himself unable to enjoy the manifold blessing of romantic relationships. we watch his philosophy play itself out and wonder: is it enough? 
 craig thompson's latest work, habibi, may function well as a companion piece to paying for it, only emphasizing the inverse of brown's work: love that excludes sex. thompson balances several themes throughout habibi's unfolded history of two runaway slaves but perhaps chief among these is an exploration of love, of true love--and how it can exist, flourish, and grow even in the absence of sexual fulfillment. chester brown focused on his women as pure objects, as receptacles for his sexuality to the exclusion of their ability to exist as full-orbed human persons with dreams, hopes, loves, or even (for the most part) personalities; thompson, on the other hand, uses the objectification of his characters to craft them into noble persons deserving of dignity, of hope, of love. 
 thompson walks a narratively perilous path, pushing envelopes with his characters that draw out the terror of the human spirit balancing against the redeeming power of a full-bodied and depth-defying love. his choices are dangerous because as his characters participate in choices that may seem abominable--and in some sense they are abominable choices, made so by their sheer necessity--thompson risks the reader losing interest in the plight of these two characters. still, the compassionate reader won't be able to help investment into their two stories, which are really just one story. 
 in habibi, thompson introduces us to his heroine, dodola, as she is sold into marriage to a scribe who will teach her to read, to understand the power of stories. dodola is nine and thompson does not spare us the aftermath of her wedding night. what's worse is that the anguish of such a scene, such an experience, is small in comparison to the fate dodola and her adopted son zam will live out. thompson makes a cruel god for his world and creations; yet it is in his cruelty that we see the beauty of dodola and zam spill out in habibi's nearly seven hundred pages. 
 habibi is a major work in comics literature and thompson's first since the nearly-six-hundred-page 
 blankets 
 . comparisons will be obvious. both works traffic deeply in religious language and colour their texts in displays of sacred ferocity. both explore the boundaries and need for love and human contact. both play with non-linearity in storytelling, skipping back and forth and only revealing the past in time to illuminate the future. these two creations are very much the work of the same author and it's a joy to see his voice maturing. 
 still, for those hoping for another blankets, thompson has something very much different in store. in both tone and scope, habibi is an entirely more ambitious work. we see thompson redressing things that were focal points in blankets. in the former book, raina is depicted in such sacred light by thompson that she becomes the ultimate example of female sexual objectification--all with the best intentions of course, but when young craig deifies her, he makes her into little better than a graven image. in habibi, however, when dodola is depicted nude (which is often), she is wholly human. this is a triumph of thompson's technique for in the midst of the narrative, she is being wholly objectified, yet these instances serve only to drive home her humanity. for the majority of those within habibi's narrative landscape, dodola exists much as chester brown's ideal woman--she is merely a receptacle for their sexual advances. thompson, however, prevents the reader from seeing her in this way by refusing to give her the visual lyricism her bestowed upon raina. both are sacred and both are holy, but the one is made so by her sexuality while the other is made so by her personhood. it's a difficult line to draw and that thompson illustrates it so well ably demonstrates why he is one the leading auteurs in the medium. 
 [even odds that thompson actually tried this out at some point in his life.] 
 habibi is a book marked by rape, slavery, castration, forced marriages, the murder of children, harems, and love. while in its murk and depths, it may not seem possible that the last of these--love--should so completely over-power all else, but this is the case. love is not always victorious, but it is always glorious. the love of these two for each other is simultaneously heart-rending and heart-warming. and it is for this reason that i won't soon forget that when habibi asks of love without sex, is it enough? the answer, though quiet in the face of the world's roar, is defiant: yes, it is. 
 note 
 one word about the art: it's manifestly evident why this book took thompson six years to create. beyond the research necessary to develop such a well-rounded story that borrows so heavily from the qur'an, habibi's art is a wonder. the intricacy with which thompson approaches his pages staggers the imagination--especially when one recalls the stress-injury pain in his hand that he related in carnet de voyage. so many of the pages of habibi feature delicate ornamentation pulled from islamic culture, ornament that would take hours to complete. here's an example: 
 these are corners from four different pages, showing the kind of decoration that thompson wrapped around entire pages. at first i presumed that he drew this just the once and reproduced the designwork for subsequent pages. this photo though shows that each page's work was distinct. that thompson took the care to patiently (or impatiently, it hardly matters) draw out these magnificent designs helps flesh out just how much effort was poured into this production. the six years shows and thompson outdoes anything i'd seen from him previously. 
 [review courtesy of good ok bad] 4.5 stars! ahhhhhh! 
 series review (combined with an anime series review) will be on my channel in the coming weeks, once i've finished watching the show :) a very low-key, beautiful story with amazing artwork. also very canadian. it was the evening before the inauguration, and i was looking for something to read, something that would fortify me against the dark rhetoric of soon-to-be president trump. i decided on march 3, the final volume of congressman john lewis' graphic autobiographical account of the civil rights struggle, and it turned out to be an excellent choice. 
 i read half of the book that night, from the birmingham church bombing in september of '63 to the failure of the mississippi freedom democratic party to seat their delegates at the convention in august of '64. i read of lewis' painstaking organizing efforts during the dangerous ""mississippi freedom summer,"" when the brave young activists of sncc labored to register black people to vote. afterward, i reflected on the recent attempts to suppress the black vote with voter i.d. laws--in wisconsin, in north carolina, in florida, in texas--and i realized how vital to the health of democracy the courage of heroes like john lewis can be. 
 i finished the book the next morning, waiting for the inauguration to begin. i read of ""bloody sunday,"" the attempt of civil rights activists to march from selma to montgomery for voting rights, and how it ended on a bridge in selma when non-violent marchers were beaten by the billy clubs of alabama state troopers, how john lewis himself was beaten severely, suffering a concussion and other injuries. i read, too, how america's horror at such gratuitous violence led to the passing of the voting rights act of 1965. 
 soon the inauguration began, and i heard our new president speak. he spoke of ""american carnage"" and--although it was a different ""carnage"" he spoke of--i couldn't help thinking of four little girls blown to pieces by a bomb in birmingham, of the murdered civil rights workers chaney, goodman, and schwerner, and of john lewis himself: sprawled unconscious, bleeding from the head on the pavement of the edmund pettus' bridge. 
 our new president continued to speak. he reminded us that ""whether we are black or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots, we all enjoy the same glorious freedoms."" i thought again of the black voters of wisconsin, north carolina, florida, and texas, and of young black men dead by police violence on the streets of ferguson, baltimore, cleveland, cincinnati, and chicago. then i thought of the recent confirmation hearings of attorney general jefferson beauregard sessions, how he defended vigorously the concept of voter i.d. laws, and i began to pray that what our president said about our freedoms may hold true, that it may continue to be true. 
 amid the uncertainty of this new era, there is one thing of which i am certain: if we wish to preserve--or to gain--those ""glorious freedoms"" for all, we must follow the heroic example of congressman john lewis and people like him. reading the three volumes of this excellent autobiography is a very good place to start. love the humour and how dark, twisted and complex it is getting. so excited to continue! awesome! i mean seriously, the movie will be coming out soon as i write this in late feb 2017, but i read the comic in english translation over 20 years ago and loved it. i also read the sequel and watched the associated anime that it inspired. it is a fantastic universe in a sort of dystopian future that poses the same basic questions as the i robot series by asimov - how will artificial intelligence change human kind and at what moment is an android sentient. a must read before the movie comes out - or after you watch it. 
 this is truly one of the greatest mangas. i have the kodansha bilingual version and as much as i find it entertaining that masamune shirow leaves a ton of editorial explanations of his drawings and ideas (and excuses sometimes for shortcuts he takes in the story), the type is really really really tiny. that being said, bantu is a total badass and major motoko kusanagi is an extremely sexy cyborg built over a human body with those human memories buried in her as her ""ghost"". her adventures as a super agent are fun and engaging as well as sexy and occasionally quite violent - nsfw and 18+ for the most part. the anime was excellent, let's hope the live action version lives up to the hype as well. they will surely not be able to cover the variety of adventures in this volume so it will be interesting to see whether they use the anime as a basis or go off on a different story altogether. there are many possibilities which is one of the things which is so great about this manga. 
 the film - like the anime - is a sort of prequel to this volume. but it is absolutely amazing! this review contains *spoilers*. 
 i've been meaning to read this graphic novel for a few months now and i'm really happy that i finally did. 
 it had me hooked right from the beginning and wouldn't let go till the end. i loved it! 
 this story follows nimona, a shapeshifter, and ballister blackheart, a villain with a vendetta. 
 they are partnering up as sidekick and supervillain, and are about to wreak some serious havoc. 
 their main mission: prove to the kingdom that sir ambrosius goldenloin and his buddies at the institution of law enforcement and heroics aren't the heroes everyone thinks they are. 
 reading nimona was such an exhilarating journey. i felt as if i was right there with ballister blackheart and nimona on their missions. they work so well together and their dialogue left me with the biggest smile on my face. 
 ""what do you mean, there are rules? why would you follow the rules? isn't that the whole point of being a villain, that you don't follow the rules?"" 
 i loved nimona as a character, her enthusiasm, relatable humor, and her story really added depth to the plot. 
 she is as unique as the storyline. 
 i also enjoyed ballister and goldenloin, even though they definitely had a complicated journey at the beginning, i really liked them together. 
 they reminded me a bit of baz and simon from carry on -- i love them with all my heart. 
 oh, and doctor blitzmeyer was a very pleasant surprise. i enjoyed reading about her and i would have loved it if noelle stevenson had added her journey to uncover the anomalous energy enhancer. 
 that ending left me in tears, i couldn't believe it when nimona didn't get a happy ending. i was incredibly sad about it, that was such an emotional part of the story. i was just listening to sad music with tears in my eyes. 
 ""despite this tragedy, we remain united. we will stay strong, and we will rebuild."" 
 but i kept thinking (until the very last page) 'what about nimona? she was left all alone at the end.' 
 i was so thankful for the epilogue. i really thought for a second there that noelle stevenson would leave it on a cliffhanger. 
 so i've heard great things about this graphic novel, but the one that really got my attention was rainbow rowell's blurb on the cover: 
 ""full of humor and heart"" 
 . i couldn't agree more with her, she summed it perfectly up in just those 5 words. 
 nimona was an adventurous, heart-gripping, and humorous story -- with amazing artwork. i love it! 
 definitely a book that lived up to the hype.

 this review and more can be found on my blog. this just in : p bryant fails hip graphic novel test 
 fun home, a cripplingly hip graphic novel, is.... 
 yes? 
 it's.... 
 yes?? 
 well, let's see, it's, you know, all right, good, yes, nods head, hummphs into beard, pulls earlobe, raises eyebrows, waves hands in a vague direction, shifts about in seat. you know. don't get me wrong. it was good. yes. cool, clever, really hip, i mean, really, as far as i can tell, my hipometer needs a new battery i think; it was not the least bit funny, but that's not such a bad thing, and... 
 stares at ceiling. 
 has sudden thought. 
 hey, you don't think alison bechdel will read this do you, she's not one of those goodreads authors who suddenly jump up like a damned jack in a box and scare the jesus out of you and tell you they devoted five years of hard graft to this work you've just more or less sneered at and damned with the faintest possible praise, i really hope not, that's not happened to me yet but i know it's happened to a few of you and it's not pretty, some of you were mildly traumatised, i saw it with my own eyes, you had to be led away to a quiet good place with a small cat to stroke. 
 so... fun room. it was all sweetly sad and worthy, painfully so, all about alison's father who was this closet gay or bi living the whole of his life in a small pennsylvanian town. so his temperament ran towards the dour and repressed and the sublimating-everything-into-his-house-restoration and then lo! shazam! alison figures this out and also - double shazam! that she herself is gay, and then they become a lot closer and then stuff happens but not that much stuff. i wanted more stuff. i'm unreasonable. 
 i read books for stuff, you know. do you know that feeling you get when you listen to your favourite album or piece of music and you're just wiped out? you sit there. you think. you imagine. you dream. it's cathartic. it's purifying and cleansing; it's almost liberating. do you know what i mean? this piece of profoundness; this thing of beautiful art was that and more. 
 i'm literally lost for words. i'm not going to give you a plot summary that would be to do this a great injustice. this was transcendental. i cannot define it or explain its effect on me. it's just stunning. it surpasses most things i've read. the scope is unprecedented and brilliant. dreams are endless and limitless; they have the potential to be anything or do anything. nothing can end them. who knew a comic book could be so visionary and spiritual at the same time as presenting an exciting story? 
 gaiman has done something really special in these pages, and that's coming from someone who hasn't read anything in the sandman series (yet). i fully intend to read it through, which will no doubt cause me to revisit this review. so i'm considering this a primary review, an initial statement before i've read the work that goes with this prologue. so i will be updating this in the future even if it's many, many, years from now. it's not like i'm going to stop using goodreads anytime soon. this website is slowly becoming a part of me. 
 i have to mention the artwork. literary quality aside, writing aside, plot allegories and symbolism aside, this was simply stunning. by its own it is just extraordinary. the covers are so damn cool. i'm amazed at it. i became lost in it. i probably still am. 
 i wonder how i will feel about this once i've read the rest of the series. will i like it more? will i appreciate it less? only time will tell. but one thing's for sure, my faith has been restored in neil gaiman. after american gods and stardust i've been very wary of him. this makes me want to try some of his other books, but i do have my priorities right: sandman series first and novels later. 
 now if you'd excuse me, i'm going to read this again. ljwkr tqryb mn ktr l'shrr lly fqt sh`bythm shkhsy@ lbtl ""lswbrhyrw"" nfsh

 ly 23 ywlyw 2016 reindeer boy is the perfect romantic christmassy book. 
 it's impossible not to be familiar with cassandra jean's work, if you're a die-hard fan of cassandra clare's the mortal instruments. her artwork is featured in both the bane chronicles and tales from the shadowhunter academy. she also illustrated shadowhunter tarot cards, among other things. 
 she has quite an original style. i would recognize her work anywhere. in fact, just by looking at the cover of this book, i knew immediately that cassandra jean was the artist. 
 oh, what a charming, charming story. heart-warming, really. and with such diverse characters! 
 quincy's life is pretty normal--before cupid arrives. he's the new kid. cute. really good looks. instantly popular. 
 but wait, he's got antlers. say what? antlers? must be the new it look. strangely enough, he seems to be very interested in quincy particularly, almost as if he knows her already. 
 despite an ongoing crush on conway, her friend, she starts to develop interest in cupid--but really, who could not succumb to the charms of that innocent, mysterious fellow? 
 and what's with the bumps on her forehead? what is happening to her? nothing like this happened before cupid's arrival. 
 extraordinary artwork. okay, so maybe miss jean could work a little more on her backgrounds, because most of the time they are pretty banal, but she knows impressively well how to draw human beings (and animals!) without them looking stereotypical. like i said, she has a special style. 
 it really is a perfect read for the holidays. lovely from start to finish. you'll breeze through it, yet it's memorable enough that you'll remember it for a long time to come. 
 blog | youtube | twitter | instagram | google+ | bloglovin' this book is the perfect antidote to the ""graphic novels aren't real books"" crowd's poison. it takes full advantage of the medium (lgm with the local boy scout troops), and just runs with it. this story could not have been told as well or as broadly using a more traditional narrative structure. and at the end, there is a perfect collapse - the three storylines streamline so perfectly into one message about cultural acclimatization and race-shame. and why it is bad. but not in a preachy way. it is not rah-rah asia, it is just quietly, ""don't be an asshole; this is who you are."" so it doesn't exclude roundeye from appreciating the message, like me at chinese new year at my ex's. i know what you are saying about me, grandma tsui! 
 so the stories include the traditional tale of the monkey king: 
 a very tasteful depiction of a chinese gentleman come to america: 
 and this cute young chinese-american boy with a perm: 
 that's what the art looks like. and if i didn't have to read this for class, i would have missed out on it, because it is not the kind of art i am immediately drawn to. me and art, we don't understand each other. museums leave me cold, and with graphic novels, i am always drawn to certain ones and repulsed by others with not one whit of rhyme nor reason nor consistency. i am the worst at art-appreciation. but i am the queen of making thanksgiving dinner. and writing drunken book reviews. and white trash fixing of silverware drawers: 
 recognize!!! 
 but yeah, a totally charming book. i have no personal immigrant experience from which to draw as a way of relating to ths story, but it works on any level of ""appreciate thyself and don't wear shoes just because the humans are doing it"" kind of thing. 
 where did that wine go? i thought it was time i added the sandman. it fits precisely into my systematic program of reading. ""hold on!"" i can hear all you folks out there saying. "" your 'systematic program of reading'? why you're one of the most eclectic readers i know!"" 
 i can understand why you might feel that way, but there is a little method to my madness. although it is true that some of the books i read (progressive political analyzes, slim 20th century verse collections, cat books, classic spiritual treatises, or the occasional literary novel) do not fit within my grand plan, most of them do. 
 about ten years ago, i realized that many books i liked were from emerging, belittled or despised forms or genres: the elizabethan popular stage play, the budding 18th century novel, the gothic romance, the victorian bourgeois novel published in serial form, the novel of sensation, the decadent experiment, the adventure tale, the sea story, the spy story, the ghost story, the pulps (both mystery and terror), the space opera and other science fiction and fantasy of the '50's, the detective novel, and the modern horror tale. whereas the writers of ""literary fiction"" are often too concerned with critical opinion, judiciously curbing their personal obsessions and producing unreadable ""writerly"" prose, the humble genre writer is more likely to give his ""inner crazy"" free rein, and either tell his eccentric story in no-nonsense fashion or--on occasion--let his plots and prose burgeon untrammeled, like a blooming meadow garden. at worst, the result is amusing, or odd; at best, it is something original, something new. 
 not long ago, it occurred to me that--being too much a creature of words--i had neglected an obvious example of an emerging genre: the comic book of the late 80's, on its way to becoming the ""graphic novel."" since i'm already in love with gaiman's american gods, i decided to begin with the sandman. 
 i am glad i did. the first eight numbers of gaiman's series are, on the surface, a traditional quest story. morpheus lord of the dreamworld, imprisoned for years by a sorcerer, goes searching for the objects of power--his helmet, his jewel, his pouch of dream-dust--so that he may once again exercise full power over his realm. but the stories it tells, and the genres in touches, range widely, from an edwardian tale of an aleister crowley type sorcerer, a pulp ec horror cain and abel anecdote, a contemporary british horror story of drug abuse, through a mythic descent into hell featuring an epic duel with demons, until it climaxes in a ghastly ordeal of modern horror (with a little meta-fiction thrown in) in which an escaped madman in a diner, in possession of the dream lord's mind manipulating jewel, brutalizes the restaurant's clientele for hours. the final number (""the sound of her wings"")--perhaps the most elegant of the eight--is however, a kind of whimsical coda, introducing us to dream's sister, the irreverent and down-to-earth death. 
 i thought everything about this saga--story, dialogue, art--was well executed...except for one small detail. gaiman chooses to make a reference to the dc universe (the justice league of america, to be precise) in a way that breaks the spell of what otherwise would be a completely self-contained, transcendent and mythic journey. but that's the kind of thing that's bound to happen in emerging genres. people take risks. 
 anyway, i'm hooked. on to sandman, volume 2: ""the doll's house"". let's get this out of the way up front: daytripper may be the best graphic novel i've ever had the pleasure to read. consider yourselves warned. 
 perhaps daytripper's biggest success is that it saves itself from being cliche. all the things that people want to say about it (e.g. ""the book is life-affirming"" or ""the book shows that death is just another part of life"") are exactly the kinds of things that could be said about that new movie that you don't want to see, the one that is bound to be an oasis of sentimental schmaltz in the desert of valuable storytelling. daytripper could have been one more lazy expression of what we all want to believe despite ourselves and despite the present evidence pouring incessantly from every media faucet, namely: that life is worth it. 
 that's what daytripper could have been. 
 instead, fabio moon and gabriel ba actively work to suppress cliche and to reign in formula. at least i imagine that they worked hard at it, because they deliver such a completely compelling work that i have to imagine bloodied sweat staining everything in their vicinity save for the gorgeous art. daytripper is moving without contrivance or manipulation. and that right there is something. 
 in trying to pin down the crowning achievement among all daytripper's perfections, i find myself struggling. there are so many wonderful things about this work that to attempt to elevate one above the others seems juvenile, a task for children who aren't really concerned with absorbing the book for what it is. so then, let's speak broadly. 
 as mentioned, the art that fills and wraps the book is just wonderful. through the pen and the brush (tools i imagine have been used here), the creators craft a world that is wholly believable, one that holds as much life as the characters that inhabit it. the set designs are so varied and detailed and appropriate that it becomes easy for the reader to just pass by never considering the time and thought that went into planning these breathing environments. i would recommend all readers take an hour after finishing the book and just flip through the pages and take in the world of daytripper without the press of narrative or dialogue or exposition or monologue hurrying attention on to what comes next. it would be a shame to miss what moon and ba have done here. 
 the degree of life invested in these characters and--specifically--into our protagonist is something special when one considers that we are only given ten short chapters with which to acquaint ourselves with those who comprise the world through which bras (our protagonist) explores his own life, purpose, and meaning. well before the final page, bras feels like a character fully revealed--as if, were the creators to free him from the shackles of the page, an attentive reader might be able to predict the course of his life. or at least write a believable excursis on one's own. it is to moon and ba's credit that i never felt that i had been handed a stereotype or stock character. both art and writing conspire to build a portrait of an individual in whom the questions of the world populous might be asked. 
 with all the talk of life-breathing characters and art, it may be inevitable that some mention be given to the life-affirming nature of the work. i am hesitant here only for the fact that i find it may be impossible to, in some small paragraph, describe the nature of the book's accomplishment without resorting to the cliches that daytripper ably overpowers. 
 certainly, the book expresses a rounded philosophy that presents life as something both valuable and worth pursuing. and argues not according to reason or the comparison of premises but by simply presenting the stories of bras' life. daytripper asks a single question relentlessly. it demands answer from every moment of life, from the big to the small. what was this life and how shall it, in death, be valued? 
 bras is occupied as the writer of obituaries and it is through this peculiar vantage that his own story unfolds. it is established early on that death is a part of life--perhaps largely so that we might get that out of the way and begin exploring what that precipitates in a meaningful way. through the book's constant return to the obituary, we are able to gradually piece together a philosophy of living, a valuation of lifespans. moon and ba present a carefully constructed yet simple meditation on what it means to be us and how life, death, and society conspire to bring meaning to the purposes we may invent for ourselves. 
 bras' answer may not be your answer, but respect must be given to his search for and then development of that answer. fabio moon and gabriel ba have done the literate society a boon by allowing us to explore these questions alongside bras, allowing us to take part in his life while he discovers its directions, purpose, and passions. 
 this is something i do not do but: i recommend that everyone read this. 
 [bookclub discussion guide] 
 [review courtesy of good ok bad] a lot of people who came into my family's life looking like heroes ended up acting more like villains. i wish i could say the opposite was also true, but that was pretty fucking rare. 
 see, this is why goodreads is so great - i wasn't in love with this volume until i read anne's excellent review, where she recontextualized the story into real-world situations that made me appreciate it so much more with her insights and anecdotes. that woman's got a gift for reviewing, man. she should come back and do it more frequently. 
 because, yeah - this time it isn't all fierce action and adventure. this has always been the story of a complicated marriage, but it's usually taken the form of ""both of our people want to kill us and the product of our miscegenation and we must flee to the farthest reaches of the galaxy."" and here, the problems are more recognizable relationship woes: working late hours, trying to make time for each other, the jealousy of the working-spouse for the caregiver-spouse's closeness with their child, turning to mind-obliterating substances to get through the grind of the day, new friends with romantic agendas - and it's all done really well with some excellent subtle detailing, but man - at first i was dismayed at how ""ordinary"" the drama was. 
 (although i am still such a fan of the damnable foreshadowing this series is so fond of dropping. this one was dropped and it set off a chain reaction that made my jaw and stomach drop simultaneously) 
 it's a different vibe from the previous books, and there was far too much time spent in robot-ville for me, but it's definitely setting the stage for exciting developments to come. and it's not all rom com themes. there's still zany-fun stuff like this: 
 and this: 
 and if you ever wanted to know what a teevee-headed android's perineum looks like, well, you're in luck: 
 but the worst thing about this book is this: 
 which is apparently a limited-edition bookplate that was given out at forbidden planet; a comic book store located, like, right there. i wish i'd been reading this series when this was going around because i would have grabbed it like cake. you snooze, you lose, karen! 
 i will leave you with this excellent observation: 
 and seriously - read anne's review. i mean, unless you haven't read the book first, and then - go read the book, silly! 
 thanks for letting me read this, maggie! it was still warm from your tummy! 
 ******************************************** 
 maggie's trying to help me out in my resolve to not burn through this entire series in a matter of days 
 ""if you can't get to it, you can't read it!"" 
 can't argue with that... 
 eventually, she moved. 
 review to come when i read this today, i experienced a strange sort of excitement combined with dread. 
 i thought to myself, ""yay! another warren ellis book!"" then, almost immediately, i thought. ""i shouldn't even pick it up though. i'm tired of getting volume 1 of a story from him, then never seeing anything else...."" 
 and yes, i'm aware of the irony. but to be fair, i only have one unfinished series. ellis has teased my heart with fell, desolation jones, doctor sleepless, injection, captain swing, ignition city.... 
 but of course i picked it up anyway. because i love everything this man writes. and i'd rather have my heart broken by him, than get 20 volumes of half-baked schlock from someone else... 
 and i read it, and it's good. though it broke my heart a little because it introduced about 20 new characters and settings, which means if the series isn't continued it's just going to bug my ocd even more.... 
 but coming on here to review it, i was pleasantly surprised to see that there is a second volume out. 
 so yeah. this one is doubly worth your time. and there's more to come... i love how twisted this was! i'm also so curious to see how there are still 5 (technically 10 if i weren't reading the black editions) volumes left! things are already so crazy, i can't wait to see what happens next. this was great! i'm definitely going to pick up the next volume soon because damn. that ending. 
 also, a+++ for all of the diversity in this comic series. love! very much enjoyed it. good, clear, compelling storytelling. it's obvious to see why the author is an eisner award winner. 
 it has a nice modern teenage storyline, but the paralell 1800's teen storyline really makes it into sometime amazing. the dollop of the fantastic in there (or magical realism, if you insist on the term) sealed the deal for me, bumping it up from a great story to a truly excellent one. 
 my only regret is that i don't think i can give this one to my little boy *quite* yet. he's 7.5 now, and while he could read and understand it. some of the relationship and betrayal stuff.... i don't know if he's quite into that yet. 
 that's not a failing of the book though. quite the opposite. any book i *wish* i could share with my boy is doing something very right. every time raina telgemeier releases a new graphic novel, i get super excited. her stories are so heartfelt and honest. 
 ''ghosts,'' however, is a little different from her previous works. for starters, it isn't as realistic, which i think is its main weakness. it definitely is the reason why i couldn't give it a 5-star-rating. 
 i loved the culture in it, especially the dia de los muertos (day of the dead) which i've always found quite interesting and spectacularly unique. it's definitely the author's most diverse book to date. 
 however much i enjoyed the dia de los muertos elements and scenes, though, i found that the addition of actual ghosts who interact with people took away from the realisticity of the story. 
 but it's pretty charming and moving nonetheless. cat's sister maya has cystic fibrosis, which is why they had to move to bahia de la luna, where fog is ever-present in the air. the right place to find ghosts, if one wishes to. 
 cat and maya's relationship is extremely heart-warming and honest. they truly care for one another and not only because they both know they're not going to be sisters for ever. plus maya, although she is very sick, keeps her smiles on at all times; i found her to be tremendously brave. 
 the themes explored make this a memorable graphic novel i think anyone looking for an original and atmospheric story should read. and it's so masterfully illustrated you'll want to keep it for ever. i sure as hell will treasure this copy. 
 blog | youtube | twitter | instagram | google+ | bloglovin' 4.5/5 stars! 
 things are getting insane, and i love it! i have no clue where this story is going to go, and i can't wait to see where it takes me :) 4.5/5 
 i saw the movie adaptation a couple of years ago and, ever since then, i've wanted to start the graphic novels. i'm so happy that i finally did, because this definitely didn't disappoint! i liked it even more than the movie because the art is used in such a clever way, so different than any other graphic novel i've read before (i've only read maus and fun home, but those were for school.) the humor was great as well and i already ordered the next volume so i can read it soon! a masterpiece of graphic novels 
 this edition as the name indicates, collects the complete run of ""persepolis"". 
 creative team: 
 creator, writer & illustrator: marjane satrapi 
 revolutionary work 
 i remember the days when we traveled around europe, it was enough to carry an iranian passport. they rolled out the red carpet. we were rich before. now as soon as they learn our nationality, they go through everything, as though we were all terrorists. they treat us as though we have the plague. 
 persepolis is the masterpiece by marjane satrapi, a pseudo-biographical work, illustrating her life since 10 years old (1980) until 24 years old (1994), where she experienced her coming-to-life, in her native iran, during the islamic revolution and the war with iraq, along with four years in europe, and her return to iran again. 
 in this graphic novel you will witness many of the convoluted events happening during the decade of the 80s in the middle east, from the point of view of a brave girl that was living at the heart of the incidents. 
 marjane is able to present each topic that she wants to expose in titled parts where you learn about relevant facts of iranian's society, its past, its present and its future. 
 however, what makes unique persepolis is the brilliant approach by marjane satrapi of those events, since while she is fearless to show the brutal side, she is also honest in showing her failures and doubts during growing up, and even she goes to the funny side of life. 
 since it's impossible for any human being to live in constant stressed status, people need to breath, to liberate the weight of their risky existence in many different ways. 
 people needs to smile, not matter where they live. they need to live. 
 and marjane knows that. 
 therefore, she masterfully is able to tell her lifestory, full of political episodes and social chapters, but always adding humoristic elements with taste and without ridiculing the seriousness and gravity of the situations. 
 anybody can tell a tragedy but... 
 ...a dramedy requires talent, tact and wit. 
 brace yourself and meet persepolis. ""all it takes is one bad day to reduce the sanest man alive to lunacy. that's how far the world is from where i am. just one bad day."" 
 now this was good, and i mean good. it's such a simple idea, but so real and powerful. i mean one bad day is all it takes. one push, one snap, one descent into chaos and it's over. once you've crossed that threshold then things will never be the same again. and the joker, being the sly and brilliant villain that he is, wants to share the experience with the world. he wants to show humanity that they are not that far from him. the first man he wants to reduce is the stalwart commissioner gordon. but, i think we all know who is intended victim actually is. 
 the joker was once normal. he had a girlfriend; he had a job, but the world shitted on him somewhat chronic. and like many people he was forced to turn to crime; he was forced to break society's rules in order to survive. that's where it all began. that first step into the darkness led to many other steps down the road of corruption. it wasn't long before petty crime turned to murder and butchery. the joker became ruined and lost himself in his nasty deeds. this is a great origin story, one that fully lives up to the character immense personality. allan more totally nails it. 
 ""there is no sanity clause! 
 so when you find yourself locked onto an unpleasant train of thought, heading for the places in your past where the screaming is unbearable, remember there's always madness. 
 madness is the emergency exit... 
 you can just step outside, and close the door on all those dreadful things that happened. you can lock them away... 
 forever."" 
 and the ending, it's all about the ending. the joker's personality is infectious. at least, he wants it to be. he's always tried to bring down the good. he ruined harvey dent, and he has always wanted to ruin the bat. and he just may have. the end is suggestive of two things: firstly, batman strangling the joker in one final heroic act, there's some irony in that sentence; secondly, batman descending to the jokers level and embracing the insanity of one bad day. 
 i'll leave you with this picture and see if you can decide: the white snake 
 i have never said this before, and it goes against all my readers' advisory training, but anyone who gives this book fewer than 5 stars is just flat-out wrong. 
 it is an absolutely stunning book. 
 foundling 
 apparently, not only can shaun tan draw and paint real good, but he is equally skilled at three-dimensional art and here he has created 75 sculptures ranging in size from 2 1/4 - 16 inches, illustrating various grimm's tales, reminding us how very dark they were in their original, undisneyfied, form, and also how very few of them we actually know. 
 the moon 
 i mean, seriously - he just sat down one day and made this: 
 the little shroud 
 in addition, tan also photographed and digitally edited all the pieces appearing in the book himself, which is just showing off at that point. 
 the boy who left home to find out about fear 
 the sculptures are perfect - haunting, evocative, textured, suggestive, occasionally unfinished or raggedy-looking, but they all embody a tone or mood so perfectly compatible with the dark weirdness of the tales. 
 fitcher's bird 
 the detail in some of these is remarkable 
 the old man and his grandson 
 simelei mountain 
 excerpts taken from this specific edition of the tales: the complete fairy tales of the brothers grimm accompany each sculpture on the recto, and the book supplies a summary of each tale in its backmatter, so you can see what you've been missing. i know i am not the only person who, after reading this, is determined to familiarize myself with some of the more obscure grimm tales. if anyone has suggestions for the best collection, i'm all ears. otherwise, i'm just gonna buy this pretty one: 
 from neil gaiman's introduction: 
 there is a tactile quality to the shaun tan sculptures. they feel primal, as if they were made in a long-ago age of the world, when the stories were first being shaped, and that perhaps the sculptures came first. 
 and 
 shaun tan makes me want to hold these tales close, to rub them with my fingers, to feel the cracks and the creases and the edges of them. he makes me want to pick them up, inspect them from unusual angles, feel the heft and the weight of them. he makes me wonder what damage i could do with them, how badly i could hurt someone if i hit them with a story. 
 these pictures make me want to put the stories in my mouth, knowing that i will eventually have to spit them out again, reluctantly, in words. 
 the fox and the cat 
 all of these things are true for me, too, and additionally, i want to find a picture that shows all of the sculptures at once, on a bunch of shelves or something, just to appreciate the scope of his accomplishment. but internet has not provided this visual for me. yet. the closest i could find is this: 
 which is more frustrating than anything.. 
 all these review-pictures were taken by me from the book with my little camera, and are much more impressive and detailed in the actual book, with its tricky-to-photograph glossy paper. (or in any professional-type photos that can easily be found online. use your googler.) 
 here's one, for those of you who don't google well: 
 there's also a cool step-by-step description of process here. 
 just one-hundred percent impressive in every way. this book is a treasure. 
 the riddle 
 shaun tan, you are great at all things. 
 and if you are ever moving home and cannot fit all these sculptures in your cardboard boxes, i will take them off your hands. i've been hearing about this comic for a long while, and now that i finally got a copy and read it, i can see what all the fuss is about. 
 so... yeah. i want all of this all the time. can we somehow make this happen? if i were judging this book solely on its artwork, it would be an easy five stars. there are five main stories, plus an introduction and a conclusion, each with their own style of illustration. it's not that i love them all equally, but i do generally appreciate range and variety : 
 in a way, it kind of reminded me of fear(s) of the dark, a film in which several different illustrators bring their own brand of creepy to life through unique animation stylings: 
 this book is obviously more limited in its range because it is all coming from a single imagination, but as far as artwork goes, i dig it 
 however, the stories were mostly just okay. 
 they are definitely not scary, or weren't to me anyway, and they fall more on the side of ""atmospheric"" or ""ominous"" than ""you will never sleep again."" 
 which, considering this is meant as a ya book is probably for the best, but i'm still looking for my big scare, and i fear it will never come. 
 which is totally the wrong kind of fear. 
 an introduction 
 this is just a little tease, not so much a story as a setting of the mood for what is to come. 
 our neighbor's house 
 this one feels very familiar. there's an olde timey new england vibe to it, and while i don't think it's actually based on anything, it feels like a mashup of a bunch of different stories, like something that would be read aloud in a spoooooky voice during a haunted hayride right before costumed people come running out of the woods all clawing and moaning to the delighted shrieks of girl scouts. makes me want to drink warm cider. 
 a lady's hands are cold 
 this had probably my favorite artwork of the bunch 
 and i enjoyed the way it exploded offa the page 
 and it's also in the running for top story (along with our neighbor's house). this one reads more like a fairy tale than the others; a little hint of bluebeard but with fewer wives, more property damage, and much less gratitude. 
 his face all red 
 i'm honestly not sure what happened in this one. maybe i'm missing some subtlety, but near as i can figure, this is the story arc: 
 -spooky tease/declaration 
 -backtrack 
 -story story story 
 -action! 
 -repercussions of action 
 -spooky happenings 
 -investigation 
 -confirmation that previous action! occurred 
 -the end 
 i don't understand this at all. there's an expectation of some kind of twist or reveal, but instead the ending is like someone going through the house on their way to bed: yup, door's locked, stove's off, cat has water, everything is where i thought it was... 
 what am i missing? 
 my friend janna 
 this has the bones of a very traditional ghost story, but there's just too much story around what could have been a genuinely spooky read if it didn't meander so much. i think horror works best when it is streamlined, when there's ambiguity left over for the reader to fill in with their own worst imaginings and also when the journey is straight and fast and decisive like a gunshot or a thunderclap. this one is so frontloaded with unfocused exposition at the beginning that you get lulled into what is ultimately a very gentle horror. i think the illustrations work particularly well in conjunction with this story, but i also think it would have been much more effective if it were whittled down a bit. 
 the nesting place 
 another one - no idea, really, what's going on here. i mean, i understand the basic plot, but it's the details that leave me head-scratching. the prologue seems to suggest that the ... situation is location-specific, but that's clearly not the case, nor is it familial, although it tangentially affects a family over generations, and i know what i just said about ambiguity being good for horror, but how does that ending work? is it both? or migrated? and aren't they going to the very same city that was effective as a threat and avoided on the previous page? i don't understaaaaaand! 
 in conclusion 
 this is another little shorty - the urban legend rim shot to end end the collection on a pop. it's a little red riding hood offshoot whose zinger is pretty much the same shape as this joke that i am spoiler tagging for people who don't think pedophile jokes are ever funny: 
 a pedophile walks through the woods with a child. the child says, ""these woods are scary."" the pedophile says, ""tell me about it. i have to walk back through here alone."" 
 different punch line, but the same basic ""gotcha!"" energy. 
 i'm giving it a four because i did like the artwork, but the stories themselves are pretty patchy, so i'm being a bit generous here. 
 dear books - please be scarier for me! ** spoiler alert ** 
 i was surprised by two things. 1, george r. r. martin can finish a story without killing the protagonist, and 2, george r. r. martin can finish a story. this book falls in to the difficult category of, ""well-executed but i have no idea how to give it a star rating or if i ever want to read it again or recommend it to anyone."" 
 that said, it *was* very well executed. and i suppose that's the heart of the matter. 
 so... yeah. five stars if you want a sweet, well-rounded story that distantly circles the fact that the main character.... 
 *spoilers, by the way* 
 ...is a five year old boy who doesn't realize that his mother isn't on a business trip. that's she's dead. first the reader, then the character comes to realize that. 
 so... yeah. if that's what you're looking for in a graphic novel. then this one's for you. but honestly, i don't know what the target audience is for this. i'd never give it to my kids. 
 maybe it's for the same group of people that like to read those chicken soup for the soul books and cry all day? 
 so... yeah. lot of good stuff here. but the core concept isn't really one that i'm looking for more of in my life. i cry too much these days anyway. i don't need any help... 
 p.s. it also outs santa claus. so even if you want your kids to read a book about parent-death, you might want to re-consider there, if you want to keep that particular piece of myth alive. 
 ^^ sorry. spoilers about santa. to see the full review, please visit https://readrantrockandroll.com/2017/... 
 iaeur(tm)ve been pondering about what to say about this book for days. it took me awhile to see how i felt about the book and i ended up reading it twice. i could feel myself frowning the entire way all the way to the end. 
 there are two different storylines parallel to each other. the prose is the story of mary in 1982, while the haunting, interlaced, black and white illustrations are ellaaeur(tm)s story in the present. 
 mary is an orphan living at thornhill in 1982 and is waiting to be adopted. sheaeur(tm)s one of the only girls left along with a very mean girl who enjoys tormenting and bullying mary to the point that mary remains locked in her room most days. 
 she dreads even coming out to eat and spends all of her time in her room making dolls or reading the secret garden. maryaeur(tm)s story is told from her diary pages. i found it emotional and really couldnaeur(tm)t understand why something wasnaeur(tm)t being done to control the behavior of these girls who were treating her wrongly and bullying her. there are spoilers/hints along the way which gives you an idea about the end. i thought that was almost too much. 
 ellaaeur(tm)s story is quite different. told in the present, sheaeur(tm)s moved into a house right next door to thornhill and deals with her own set of problems. her mother is absent for whatever reason, and her father is busy with work-related engagements, so ella is left alone most of the time. thornhill is viewed from right outside her window and she becomes curious when she sees a girl in the garden there, even though thornhill has been shut down since 1982. itaeur(tm)s abandoned, but ella is curious and begins to wonder about the girl she sees from time to time. she begins exploring the garden because, what else is there for her do? 
 this is a fairly large book at about 540 pages, but many of the pages are illustrations which make it a fairly quick read. i found the illustrations paired with maryaeur(tm)s diary haunting and i didnaeur(tm)t want to put it down until i could find out what was going to happen with these two girls. i found the book unique, chilling, and atmospheric, but honestly, i wasnaeur(tm)t happy with parts of it, especially the unexplained abrupt ending. overall, itaeur(tm)s good and even though itaeur(tm)s juvenile fiction, it kept me engaged until the end. 
 my rating is 4.5**** i freaking loved this graphic novel. the art work is amaze balls! i loved the story line. lady mechanika is trying to find out what happened to make her what she is today. she's also fights the good fight for any evil out there. this is steampunk awesomeness =) 
 i will leave a few pictures so you can see what i'm talking about. two of them i took myself from my book and you can tell. lol, enjoy! 
 fin two hours of my life that i will never get back! 
 this is the graphic novel edition of ""ghost world"" by fantagraphics books, originally published as chapters, in the comic book series ""eightball"" #11-18. 
 creative team: 
 writer & illustrator: daniel clowes 
 much ado about nothing 
 people who read my reviews know that i'm not usually negative (for not saying of giving 1-star ratings) when i am commenting about my readings, and being that negative, doesn't cause me any joy, sadly when i do feel that it's necessary, well i don't hesitate about it, even if it's against a generally popular and praised work. 
 no book is a $100 bill to be liked by anybody. 
 i didn't have a clue about what was about ghost world, and after reading it... 
 ...i still don't have a clue about what was about it!!! 
 the main characters of ghost world are enid coleslaw (her dad legally changed his last name from cohn) and rebecca (becky) doppelmeyer, both 18-years old girls, both just graduated from high school, best friends and still looking out for what to do with the rest of their lives. 
 the graphic novel doesn't show any north, no real storyline, just a bunch of unrelated episodes without any clear purpose, where enid and becky basically interact with old acquaintances or new people, always commenting something negative about them. 
 much negative about everything 
 both, enid and becky, are very mean to everybody, they are constantly pointing out their faults, calling them with offensive names and generally criticizing them, behind their backs and/or in their faces. enid and becky also have negative opinions about almost anything around them. even, enid and becky comment in negative light about themselves! 
 in a few cases, some of the support characters deserve the negative critique, but in most cases, enid and becky are just mean without any provocation or justification. 
 so, i guess that since enid and becky are sooooooo negative about everybody and everything, i don't feel so bad myself for being that negative in my review about the graphic novel. 
 i have read (and watch) a lot of black comedy products and i have laughed plenty with them, but while ghost world tries to be humorous, honestly i didn't feel the impulse to laugh with it, not in the least. 
 much lost about potential 
 it's a shame (at least in my very personal opinion) that ghost world didn't exploit its own storytelling potential, since the characters and ambiance were ideal to build a plot in the style of other products like the live-action film amelie or the animated tv series daria. 
 curiously enough, ghost world ""born"" in 1993 and lasted until 1997; daria began in 1997 and amelie is from 2001, so one could think that maybe, just maybe, ghost world could serve as an inspiration and/or to open the road for those projects, but i don't know for sure about that, and after all, ghost world is a very pale image in comparison with those mentioned wonderful masterpieces. 
 much movie about graphic novel 
 i knew that there is a film adaptation of ghost world, but i haven't been able to watch it (yet). after reading this graphic novel, i wanted to check (reading it at imdb) the premise in the movie, since i wasn't able to understand how somebody would be able to pull a movie out of this. 
 i wasn't surprised when i noticed that the movie had key changes in its core plot, since the graphic novel doesn't have any plot at all! 
 so, it's understandable that the film is different in its basics to be able to present a proper storyline to follow. 
 and i heard that the movie is far, far, faaar better product than the original graphic novel. happy birthday greg!!! 
 this is a stunning book of sequential art in which the only words are the epigraph and a quote from emerson at the end. 
 i was a little concerned with the epigraph, initially, because it's one of those goopy new age-y sounding statements full of abstractions but signifying nothing: 
 in the animal kingdom, animals neither love nor hate each other. 
 love and hate are parts of a natural whole. a supreme balance many consider to be universal, or even divine. an elemental love. 
 a love that mankind could never experience. 
 i'm not really sure how that's supposed to apply to this story, unless that's simply the mission statement for the series as a whole. in any event, it made me very glad that there are no words to the actual story, because the artwork speaks for itself. loudly. clearly. 
 ""mankind"" doesn't come into play at all - this isn't one of those ""man is bad and nature suffers"" messages. here, everything that happens is completely within the natural world. there are orcas, elephant seals, musk oxen, rabbits, polar bears, etc, and animals fight each other, hunt their prey, save their young, live and die while a volcano erupts sending burning lava and avalanches throughout their habitats. 
 the animals neither speak nor grieve - there are some close calls, but also many animals who get crushed, burned, eaten. there are no songs, none of the animals make dresses or play the banjo. 
 it's ragged, brutal survival. and the artwork is phenomenal 
 you can almost hear the bears roar 
 swat! 
 bearfight! 
 it's absolutely magnificent - beautiful and badass and realistic. i have already ordered the first book in this series; the tiger and i await the third le lion; being made available in my country. 
 and obviously, i will be buying this one in hard copy asap. 
 ***************************************************** 
 oh my god, the artwork 
 so beautiful. so badass. 
 full review tk, but just a heads-up that it's on netgalley right now - 
 https://s2.netgalley.com/catalog/book... whoa. lots of stuff. i just watched the first few episodes of the anime recently, and this volume had so much action all packed into it! (around 6 or 7 episodes' worth). 
 i think i'm going to take my time reading these, as i really enjoy being surprised by the show. the art style was a bit distracting at times, but i really enjoyed this! eh this was an okay graphic novel. i was hoping for a bit more of an understandable plot. i read outlander and this graphic novel sometimes got me confused, especially at the beginning. also, where was jamies curly hair!? also claire's breasts kept on getting bigger and bigger - ""the mysterious case of the growing breasts"" (sounds like a rated pg-13 nancy drew novel lol) 
 this didn't really convey the exact plot line of outlander which is understandable but it seemed quite off a points. although i did enjoy reading from jamie's pov along with others. 
 also, why is it only 1/2 the book? interesting. 
 i give this a 3.5/5 stars. 
 i love outlander so this was definitely a different depiction of it but fun to read nonetheless! congratulations! semifinalist in goodreads' best graphic novels & comics category 2016! 
 three stars with room to grow. 
 while impatiently waiting for more installments of saga to come out, i decided to check out this other brian k. vaughan book, because i liked the cover, the synopsis promised me plucky girls, 80's references, and this right here is how you get my attention: 
 suburban drama and supernatural mysteries collide in this smash-hit series about nostalgia, first jobs, and the last days of childhood. 
 all my sweet spots = accounted for. 
 because, yes - plucky girls: 
 80's references: 
 nostalgia (for me, anyway - this picture made my heart soften): 
 and there are also some pretty funny 80's-flavored dream sequences: 
 i'm just not hooked yet. it's no saga, that's for sure. but in a more positive light, it's actually what i thought lumberjanes, vol. 1: beware the kitten holy was going to be, before realizing that series was for a much younger reading age. this one has all the girl-power and female bonding and general badassery-adventure setup as lumberjanes, but with significantly more guns, cussin' and good-natured pal-ribbin', pterodactyls, and actual danger, and it is far less p.c. because it was the 80's, my friends, and twelve-year-old internetless kids from the suburbs didn't always have access to the rich spectrum of life and they sometimes said ""faggot."" but if time travelers can forgive a kid for their squeamishness: 
 so can we. and for being set in midwestern 80's suburbia, there's some decent diversity in the characters here - there's a jewish girl and a vietnamese(?) girl and an adopted girl of indeterminate race and everyone's favorite stereotype: a chain-smoking irish-american lass, tough and redheaded and on her way to becoming a criminal just like the rest of her family! but apart from her homophobia and the cliche of her, she's pretty rad - willing to step up and throw down for her equally-fierce pack of paper girls against the most unexpected foes. 
 i didn't always understand what was going on, but i'm confident it will all become clearer in future volumes. i'm intrigued enough to continue with the series - i'm not in love with it, but it's got potential and i'll check back in next volume to see if it's getting there yet, if only to enjoy more 80's background details. this book started out so deep and sad, i was not even 20 pages in and i had already tears in my eyes. 
 going into this i was hesitant for reasons i don't even recall, but blankets really hit home for me. 
 it's an emotional story following the lives of two brothers from childhood to adulthood. i was so into the story that i barely noticed the hours going by and i managed to finish it in one sitting. the storyline goes through different times without ever seeming abrupt, it had the perfect flow. and i'm getting really emotional just thinking about everything that happened. 
 i enjoyed the family parts of this story more than the relationship bits. so when craig started to describe his girlfriend, raina (a little to much for my likes), i started to lose my enthusiasm bit by bit. but it returned whenever the family showed up. especially when the brothers were together, it broke my heart when i saw how distant they got with time. the parts from their childhood together were one of my favorites in this story. 
 it was a lonely, lovely, and comforting read that will definitely stay with me for a long time

 this review and more can be found on my blog. dammit. i love this premise so much. 
 can you please do more of it, warren? please? pretty please? i am a fan of the spirit and the messaging and the energy of this book but i'm not personally crazy about either the artwork or the story. 
 when this book first started making the rounds here on goodreads, for some reason i didn't clock that it was ya. i saw that people were adding it to their ya shelves, but i've come to terms with the fact that as long as there's a teenage character in a book, people are gonna shelve it as ya on goodreads regardless of whether it's intended for teen readers, or even appropriate for them. 
 so when i finally decided to board this lumberjane-bandwagon and found it officially categorized in the teen section of the bookstore, it threw me for a loop for a second, but then i was all ""i am glad i am now so broad-minded in the scope of my reading that i am not unwilling to read a book for a teen audience."" 
 and yet. 
 it just read so young to me. young enough that you could probably get away with marketing this to a middle grade audience without any comprehension/content concerns. and having already adjusted (not lowered, mind you, but adjusted) my expectations to teen mode, i found myself requiring additional mental adjustments to try to fit in with the enthusiastic fans - to be the thoughtful reader this book deserved. 
 maybe i'm just accustomed to the way teens in the ya novels i read sound like they're twenty-five and maybe this is a more accurate representation of how teens really speak and behave, but it still felt really childish and i don't think me-as-teen would have liked it. i think i would have felt talked-down to, the way religious material directed at teens misses that target of age-appropriateness by presenting unilaterally shiny and morally flawless characters who are perky and great at everything and willing to pitch in and fight fire and succor the needy, perfect and unstoppable like a fifties housewife on benzos. without, naturally, the benzos. 
 as a female-person, it's hard not to want to love a book that's so oohrah girl power and full of smart math-loving girlnerds who say things like 
 and that's emphasizing confidence and empowerment and athleticism and building strong female friendships, but it's just so excessively ""holy role model, batman!"" that it becomes off-putting. 
 it's a little too much of that tone that irked me in boy meets boy where everything's acceptable! and girls can do anything! and conflicts are easily resolved! in this hunky dory goody goody role modelly wonderland! 
 there's no tension here, and you know what happens when things are too relentlessly positive, right? 
 when other perfectly normal emotions go unacknowledged? 
 it's not at all bad, i guess i'm just too much of an old shriveled husk of cynical coal to not be filled with double-rainbow x chromosomes in response to this. i'm perplexed. i don't know how old these characters are meant to be, i don't understand how the magic works or what the blend of reality and fantasy is meant to serve, i don't know why everyone's going crazy for it. 
 and that makes me feel lonesome. 
 things i did like - 
 fox tummies: 
 every part that had to do with discovery channel-inspired phobias of blood-sucking catfish, river monsters, murder rivers etc... 
 the fact that the pungeon master badge looks deeply ashamed and disappointed in itself. as it should. 
 titillating subtext 
 and pretty much every loud, adorable thing ripley says. 
 ripley reminds me of a special girl i knew in the wayback - someone i was very close to and who rubbed off on me a bit, so i guess ripley also reminds me of me, which makes me like her even more. 
 here is a celebration of ripley 
 whose ""hungry"" posture is the same as her ""i have to pee"" posture 
 who is a marine biology enthusiast 
 who likes kittens 
 and also puppies 
 who is willing to fight a rude bird for some chocolate 
 and this especially made me misty, thinking about my old galpal, who was so refreshingly free from social niceties that when someone pissed her off, she'd just pee in their car at a party or something. 
 my wonderful little beastgirl. 
 i'll probably keep reading because sisterhood, but i'm not fangirling it yet. 
 ******************************************* 
 3.5 stars for the reader-who-is-me, but i definitely love and respect it more-stars as an objective overseer acknowledging its important contribution to the bookworld. this is so, so, so, so good. it doesn't try to be disgusting and it doesn't mainly focus on the zombies, surprisingly. it's more about the little community of survivors and their relationships, their helping each other out, their trying to find a way out of this pit of death. i felt desolate to see some characters gone too soon or left behind, but i have some hope of seeing new ones in the future that will make me stop missing the departed ones. 
 great, great comic series. my girlfriend picked this up for my son, who has recently turned 7. 
 he's a big reader, and he loves comics. though he hasn't been tested, is probably reading years ahead of whatever the standard metric is. 
 unfortunately, sarah made one of the classic mistakes here, and judged a book by its cover. in fact, she made the mistake twice. 
 1. she assumed that because it was a comic, it was probably for kids. 
 2. she assumed that a book with animal characters is for kids. 
 this is a mistake that someone who has better comic literacy never would have made. if for not other reason than because they'd read maus at some point in their lives. 
 so on one hand, it wasn't a good choice, because it was too much for my little boy. (he read it just fine, but it was too violent for him, and i think the plot of treachery and betrayal was really beyond what he could understand.) 
 but that doesn't mean it isn't a good book. it is. the art is great, and the comic paneling is excellent in a way that i couldn't have understood 5 years ago, before i'd read several thousand comics. 
 so while it didn't strike home with my boy. it struck home with me. the story is strong, and the storytelling and art are truly beyond the pale. 
 what's more, the story was legitimately heroic in ways that i've rarely experienced. the lion's share of the credit for this should go to the art and storytelling, but the fact that the story centers around mice is important, too. the smaller you are, the more bravery means. and you can't get much smaller than a mouse.... 
 so... yeah. i wouldn't recommend it for kids under 10 or so. but if you're older than that it's well-worth your time. 
 especially recommended for those of us who always loved reepicheep, but wanted a whole book about him being a stone-cold badass. there were no words in this graphic novel. no dialogs. no written sentences. no words. 
 but, as i realized throughout my read, they weren't needed. the mesmerizing art was enough. 
 and what illustrations! never have i read such a graphic novel before! 
 it was a fast-read. i don't think i've even spend thirty minutes to get through it. the story was poignant and i loved how realistically it portrayed immigrants and how metaphorically and fantastically the author drew the world-building and settings. 
 it didn't actually speak to me to an obvious point, as i maybe predicted, since, even though i am an emigrant too (romania -> canada), i was very young at that time and we had someone to help us, unlike the main character who had to find help and shelter by himself. still, i can perfectly understand the main character's - untold - feelings and relate, in a way, to him. i was just probably more excited than he was and not as confused/lost. 
 aside for the graphics and settings, what i loved most was the fact that, not only we could see the main character's experience at traveling and changing completely of surrounding, but also the people that he meets in his way and that give him some support. it was breathtakingly captivating. 
 i do have a complaint though: it was, like i said, too short. too fast-paced. it could have been longer i believe, because every scene lasted less than two minutes or so. that did give some unrealism to the story - not including the settings which i like to consider well-fitting everything. it would also have been interesting to get to know his wife and child better, with some more scenes including them and maybe a little more to why he decided to leave his country. the blurb does implicitly or explicitly tell us why, depending on your point of view, but actually seeing it would have given some even more intensity to the story and a solid background. although, i do understand that this is mainly about adaptation, experiences and going forward. 
 absolutely recommended! not only will it appear spectacular and surprising, to lovers of graphic novels or not, but it is also short and easy to get into the story. ""buildings burn, people die, but real love is forever..."" 
 the crow is a story of love, hate, violence, honor, greed, revenge, and, ultimately, redemption. 
 the world of james o'barr is beautiful, despite its darkness. 
 there's a very fine line between being a hero and a villian. that's the reason i love eric draven so much. eric is the perfect example of an antihero. he is a good guy forced to do bad things in order to avenge his beloved fianca(c)e. he is a complex character you can't help but root for, because his rage is justifiable. i needed something to take my mind off of the fact that i just finished watching all 9 seasons of the office and paper girls did just that. 
 it's a compelling storyline with amazing artwork that had me right from the beginning. 
 i was, however, confused a few times because the storyline moved a little too fast. 
 and i wanted more of a backstory to the characters, mainly on mackenzie ""mac"" and her group. 
 this graphic novel jumps right into the main plot line; monster demons invading earth on halloween, which was interesting to read about, but after a while i just wanted to get to know the 4 main girls. 
 and i'm definitely interested in checking out the next volume because the very last page was incredible. 
 3.5 stars 
 arc from netgalley (thank you).

 this review and more can be found on my blog. i run a hand over the sandpaper skin i've read about. survivors find themselves grazed from it when the shark glides by. 
 everything is teeth. 
 this is a family memoir in graphic novel form by evie wyld, focusing on her childhood trips to visit relatives in australia and her lifelong fascination with sharks; their role in both her actual experiences and in the realm of her imagination. 
 the writing is beautiful: 
 it's not the images that come first when i think of the parts of my childhood spent in australia. 
 or even the people. it's the sounds 
 - the butcher birds and the magpies that lived amongst us on the back veranda. 
 and stronger still, the smells - 
 eucalyptus, watermelon, and filter mud, 
 rich and rude and sickly strong. 
 most of all, the river, muddy and lined with mangrove. 
 salt and sulphur; 
 at low tide the black mud that smelled bad, 
 that had stingray burrows hollowed out in it. 
 the smell i associate with the smell of sharks. 
 the artwork is also stunning - a combination of cartoon and hyper-realistic pencil drawings which are perfect complements to the text. 
 even the endpapers are fantastic: 
 the story itself is fairly quiet. this isn't a bleak memoir about childhood trauma or life-changing circumstances; it's more like a series of snapshots of small memories - some good, some bad, muted by life-distance, and riddled with sharks. 
 sharks are everywhere in this book and they represent both an alluring magnetism and an embodiment of her fears. she is enthralled by the stories her australian family, fishermen by trade, recount about attacks and near-misses, but she also imagines her parents and brother being eaten by sharks. if i think the worst, then the worst is unlikely to happen. 
 sharks are also fun at parties 
 her first childhood crush is on shark attack survivor rodney fox, whose story and photographs she discovers in a book about sharks. in what has to be one of the most romantic and erotic passages ever involving a love-interest's exposed insides: 
 rodney fox, i fall for you at six years old. 
 i see right inside your viscera and you tell me about surviving. i read about how your abdomen was opened 
 and all your ribs broken. your diaphragm punctured, 
 lung ripped open, shoulder blade pierced, 
 spleen uncovered. 
 the main artery from your heart exposed. 
 the tendons in your hand all cut... 
 and how the shark left behind a tooth, 
 still stuck in your wrist. 
 i see the before photograph, impossible red 
 sausages stuffed into an empty carcass, 
 the white skin tender, swollen and peeling away. 
 and i see the after photograph, the horsehair 
 stitches, that make a perfect semi-circle from 
 shoulder to ribs - a cartoon apple bite. 
 and your face: salty eyes, 
 strong bone in your nose. 
 an expression that said 
 the whole thing was just fine. 
 stuck in the mouth, wrestling your thumbs into its eyes till it lets go, 
 and you feel yourself loose in your skin suit. 
 the shark is gone and people are nudging your guts back inside, 
 and when you wake again it hasn't changed your face. 
 it is all fine. 
 i solemnly understand you to be the greatest living man. 
 later, visiting a shark museum, she recognizes him just by a photo of his spleen, which is the truest test of devotion and intimacy. 
 she also, while watching jaws, finds other men who appeal to her: i like the moustache on quint, and the beard on hooper. 
 when she's home in england, she regales her school-bullied brother with stories of sharks to distract him from his sadness, and has fantasies of shark attacks where no shark attack outside of a syfy movie could be. 
 incidentally - this image is actually from ghost shark, one of the best syfy shark movies 
 sharks stand in for that nameless dread permeating childhood - for all of the situations you don't understand, for the feeling that something bad could happen at any moment, sharks are the boogeyman embodying all of life's anxieties, lurking in the most unexpected places. 
 but they aren't just manifestations of her fears, they also inspire awe and respect, as the majestic but misunderstood creatures they are. when she is taken to ""vic hislop's killer shark show,"" by her father, featuring the attraction of ""conan the record breaking white pointer,"" she is excited, wanting to be there for feeding time, imagining: 
 great hunks of raw meat, 
 bellowing gops of blood against the bone-white teeth. 
 but it turns out to be a cheap and sordid spectacle, featuring sacking-cloth sharks, a video in which vic hislop himself characterizes sharks as ""killing machines with a taste for human flesh,"" posing triumphantly with the corpses of sharks, cutting them open to reveal their insides, and a photo of rodney fox's spleen, ""but there are no after photographs with your smiling face,"" which reduces him to a victim instead of a survivor. worst of all is conan, for whom there will be no more gops of blood. instead, his seventeen-foot corpse is suspended in a tank of nauseatingly dirty water, undignified, skin flaking away. 
 and while many of the images of sharks are sad - hauled out of the water and killed by her relatives, cut open to reveal their young (taking ""two puppies back home for frying""), 
 or definned and rolled unceremoniously, wastefully, back into the water, or left to thrash and wear herself out and die, it's never preachy, just memories of things that happened. 
 it's a spectacular book in both words and images, and i loved loved loved it. 
 one more reminder for me to never go to australia: 4.5 
 very very very powerful and i like that you see the relationship between spiegelman and his father throughout."," i absolutely loved it and i know i'll visit this book again and again my only sad: the alot does not make an appearance 
 so i demand a sequel i demand it alot dear mr vaughan 
 i do not know what process you go though to produce comics like these i do not know what dark alchemy you perform what infernal pacts you have agreed to what terrifying drugs you must imbibe i have no idea what arcane rituals you must perform every day what odd odd habits of diet and exorcize you must maintain to keep your mind limber and sparking to write things like this 
 i just wanted to say whatever it is you're doing please keep doing it 
 sincerely 
 pat this was so good i held off on buying the rest of the series before i started because i wanted to make sure i liked it and now i'm so frustrated i can't continue immediately the art the characters the tone the story--i'm loving it all 
 more please now thank you since the movie came out i've found myself having to explain why watchmen is important and interesting despite being the most revered comic book of all time it never really entered the mainstream until the film now people are rushing to read it in droves but approaching watchmen without an understanding of its history and influences means missing most of what makes it truly special 
 the entire work is an exploration of the history and purpose of the superhero genre: how readers connect to it and what it means philosophically moore stretches from fond satire to outright subversion to minute allusion encasing the once-simple genre in layers of meaning even as he refines and compresses the genre he also constantly pushes its boundaries watchmen is unapologetic unflinching and most miraculous of all freed from the shame which binds so many comics 
 moore never stoops to making an entirely sympathetic character there is no real hero and none of the characters represents moore's own opinions superhero comics are almost always built around wholly sympathetic admirable characters they represent what people wish they were and they do the things normal people wish they could do 
 it is immediately gratifying escapism which many people attach themselves to especially the meek who lead tedious unfulfilled lives many people also do the same thing with celebrities idolizing them and patterning their own lives on the choices those famous people make but in this modern age of reality tv and gossip media we know that celebrities are not ideal people 
 indeed their wealth and prominence often drives them mad while everyone else views the world from the bottom up they view it from the top down and this skewed perspective wreaks havoc with their morality and sense of self moore's superheroes represent something even beyond this celebrity not only are they on the top of the heap but they are physically different from other human beings their superiority is not just in their heads and pocketbooks but in their genetics 
 they are not meant to be sympathetic they are meant to be human they are as flawed and conflicted as any of us and while we may sometimes agree with them as often we find them distant and unstable 
 many people have fingered rorschach as the 'hero' of this tale but that is as flawed as pinning satan as the hero of 'paradise lost' following the classic fantasy of power rorschach inflicts his morality on the world around him but since he is not an ideal but a flawed human we recognize that his one-man fascist revolution is unjustified 
 we all feel that we see the world clearly and everyone around us is somehow confused and mistaken often we cannot understand how others can possibly think they way they do sometimes we try to communicate but there is often an impassable barrier between two minds: no matter how much we talk or how pure our intentions one will never be able to convince the other 
 we all feel the temptation to act out--if only those disagreeable people were gone the world would be a better place while this justification may be enough for most comic writers moore realizes that the other guy thinks everything would be better if we were gone rorschach lashes out because his ideas are too 'out there' and he is too socially insecure to convince anyone that he is right he is unwilling to question himself and so becomes a force of his own violent affirmation 
 most who sympathize with him are like him: short-sighted and desperate unable to communicate with or understand their fellow man many are unwilling even to try rorschach becomes a satire of the super hero code which says that as long as you call someone evil you are justified in beating him to death this same code is also commonly adopted as foreign policy by leaders in war which moore constantly reminds us of with references to real world politics 
 the rest of the characters take on other aspects of violent morality with varying levels of self-righteousness like the british government of the 1980's which inspired moore or the american government of the beginning of this century we can see that equating physical power with moral power is both flawed and dangerous subjugating others 'for their own good' is only a justification for leaders who feel entitled to take what they can by force 
 the only character with the power to really change the world doesn't do so his point of view is so drastically different from the common man that he sees that resolving such petty squabbles by force won't actually solve anything it won't put people on the same page and will only create more conflict and inequality dr manhattan sees man only as a tiny nearly insignificant part of the vast complexity of the cosmos though he retains some of his humanity his perspective is so remote that he sees little justification for interference any more than you or i would crush the ants of one colony to promote the other 
 the ending presents another example of one man trying to enforce his moral solutions upon the entire world not only does this subvert the role of the super hero throughout comic book history but reflects upon the political themes touched on throughout the book man is already under the subjugation of men--they may not be superhuman but still hold the lives of countless billions in their hands it is no coincidence that moore shows us president nixon a compulsive liar and paranoid delusional who ran the most powerful country in the world as he saw fit 
 moore's strength as a writer--even more than creating flawed human characters--is telling many different stories which are really the same story told in different ways all layered over each other each story then comments on the others presenting many views his plots are deceptively complex but since they all share themes they flow one into the next with an effortlessness that marks moore as a truly sophisticated writer 
 many readers probably read right across the top of this story flowing smoothly from one moment to the next and never even recognizing the bustling philosophical exploration that moves the whole thing along the story-within-a-story 'the black freighter' winds itself through the whole of watchmen and for moore serves several purposes firstly it is another subversion of comic book tropes: moore is tapping into the history of the genre when books about pirates cowboys spacemen monsters and teen love filled the racks next to the superhuman heroes before that variety was obliterated by the comics code (yet another authoritarian act of destruction by people who thought they were morally superior) 
 but in the world of watchmen there are real superheroes and they are difficult flawed politically motivated and petty so superhero comics are unpopular in the watchmen world because there superheroes are fraught with political and moral complexity these are not the requisite parts of an escapist romp we don't have comic books about our politicians after all we may have political satire but that's hardly escapist fun 
 so instead they read about pirates beyond referencing the history of comics 'the black freighter' works intertextually with watchmen the themes and events of one follow the other and the transitions between them create a continuous exploration of ideas moore never breaks off his story because even superficially unrelated scenes flow from one to the other in a continuous multilayered self-referential narrative 
 i continually stand in awe of moore's ability to connect such disparate threads many comic authors since have tried to do the same but from morrison to ellis to ennis they have shown that striking that right balance is one of the hardest things an author can do most of moore's followers end up with an unpalatable mish-mash instead of a carefully prepared and seasoned dish 
 unlike most comic authors moore scripted the entire layout for the artist: every panel background object and action using this absolute control moore stretched the comic book medium for all it was worth filling every panel with references allusions and details which pointed to the fullness and complexity of his world moore even creates meaning with structure so that the size shape and configuration of panels tell much of the story for him 
 one of the volumes is even mirrored so that the first page is almost identical to the last the second page to the second last and so on that most readers don't even notice this is even more remarkable that means that moore used an extremely stylized technique so well that it didn't interfere with the story at all 
 but therein lies the difficulty: if a reader isn't looking for it they will probably have no idea what makes this books so original and so remarkable this especially true if they don't know the tropes moore is subverting or the allusive history he calls upon to contextualize his ideas 
 while many readers enjoy the book purely on its artistic merit the strength of the writing and the well-paced plot others disregard the work when they are unable to recognize what makes it revolutionary one might as well try to read paradise lost with no knowledge of the bible or watch looney toons without a familiarity with 1940's pop culture 
 it is not a perfect work but there is no such thing moore's lead heroine is unremarkable which moore himself has lamented he did not feel entirely comfortable writing women at that point in his career and the character was forced on him by the higher ups luckily she's not bad enough to ruin the work and only stands out because she lacks the depth of his other characters 
 his politics sometimes run to the anarchic but often this is just a satire of violence and hubris moore gives no easy answers in his grand reimagining his interlocking stories present many thoughts and many points of view in the end it is up to the reader to decide for himself who was right or wrong--as if anyone truly could be 
 moore never insults the intelligence of his readers and so creates a work with more depth than anyone is likely to plumb even after numerous readings likewise he does not want you to 'hold on for the ride' but expects that you will engage and question and try to come to terms with his work yourself no one is necessarily the hero or villain and many people find themselves cowed and unsure of such an ambiguous world just as we do with the real world 
 watchmen is not instructional nor is it simply a romp this book like all great books is a journey that you and the author share the work is meant to connect us to the real world and not to let us escape from it this is moore's greatest subversion of the superhero genre and does even more than milton to ""justify the ways of god to man"" for many men delude themselves to godhood yet even these gods cannot escape their fundamental humanity 
 my suggested readings in comics this comic is so good it's starting to piss me off 
 dear mr vaughan 
 you should not be able to make me cry five times in the same fucking comic seriously twice in two pages this will not do it is neither seemly nor fair 
 please knock that shit off 
 fondly yours 
 pat 
 ps please don't knock it off of the twenty-seven books i'd read in the gr awards semifinals this is the only one that won in its category so congratulations even though i don't consider this a graphic novel as such more like a collection of unrelated cartoons better placed in the humor category but who's gonna split genre-hairs 
 although i'm pretty confident i have at least 10-15 years on this cartoonist there's still so much in this book that resonated with me which probably reflects very poorly on me - it's one thing to still be finding your way and retaining your childish mores in your twenties but it's a little less cute when you're  older 
 there are some parts of adulthood i am very good at: paying bills on time and making sure the dishes are done and the litterbox is clean and not running out of toothpaste but then there are some other things i just can't seem to get the hang of mostly in the realm of social fakery like small talk and networking and climbing that social ladder and then there are ""adult"" skills i just don't see the value of adopting like the development of an impulse control muscle that says ""don't eat that whole box of cookies in one sitting"" 
 or ""don't buy another stuffed animal you old fart"" 
 and sarah andersen seems like a soulmate in those regards 
 we are exhausted by the same things like slow walkers the ease of written vs the hell of verbal communication and the struggle of maintaining a polite and focused attention span while inwardly experiencing social anxiety and a desire to be back in the safety of one's home-cave 
 i think i used to be an extrovert but then i just got so tired i'd much rather hide out and be cozy and while i'm a little regretful that i don't take advantage of all the fine cultural things new york has to offer i feel a little ""been there done that"" and now i'm all old and groggy i'm no longer young and hot and new york is pretty much tailored for the young and hot or the rich 
 and too often i just feel like this 
 but this book makes me feel okay about myself it says it's okay to have serious attachments to stuffed animals 
 and a notebook addiction that is well-intentioned but haphazard 
 and it stresses the importance of coziness: 
 especially when it comes to cozy-fashion 
 i mean right now i am wearing doraemon poupons and a julius-monkey fleece top like a baby 
 there are of course several comics pandering to booknerds most notably 
 but the biggest adult lesson i learned from this book is: wait you're supposed to wash your bras 
 i do laundry once a week - i'm no scrub but i have never ever in my life washed a bra not even when i was a little kid living at home and someone else was doing the laundry for me how does this even work don't they get all misshapen and crumpled i do not have sweaty stinky boobs and i've never had a problem with filthy bras so i'm going to keep living the way i been living and no one's gonna stop me 
 this book also highlights a lot of girl-woes that made me shout ""i know right"" like the way the fashion industry and the lingerie industry just don't seem to be able to work together 
 the perils of long hair 
 and the mysterious ways of tampons 
 other noteworthy fist-bumps from me to ms andersen include her addressing: 
 -the joy of giving gifts and the crippling shyness of receiving them 
 -the constant dwelling on stupid things one has said long after anyone else remembers them 
 -the lack of desire to spawn 
 -the shyness that comes off as rudeness 
 -how long toenail polish lasts 
 and we also both have stuffed bunnies 
 except hers is a little more alive than mine 
 so i'm totally down to be her big sister if she is in the market for one of those we can wave shyly at each other from across the room and then go back home to our respective pj's and our too-early cat alarm clocks 
 i'm gonna peter pan myself well into my old-age senility when it will once more be completely age-appropriate for me to embrace what makes me comfortable over the challenges of the world of social expectations 
 so there this book freaked my shit out 
 yeah how's that for a blurb 
 ""this freaked my shit out"" 
 - patrick rothfuss 
 the truth is this book is amazing i've read a lot of great comics this last year and out of all of them this is the one that had the most profound emotional effect on me 
 it's not gory or graphic it's unsettling it's creepy it's like the darkest of the old-school faerie tales 
 i read it at night before i was going to go to bed and when i was done i was too unnerved to go to sleep i had to read something else to settle myself down first 
 seriously i'm 40 years old and still this thing got to me 
 highly *highly* recommended i sat down to read a little of this during lunch and ended up sitting in the restaurant for an hour after i was done eating eventually i felt guilty and left but my plans were shot for the afternoon as all i could think about was finishing this book 
 i wish there were some mechanism on goodreads to occasionally give a book more than five stars something to indicate when you think a book is more than merely excellent like for every 100 books you review you earn the right to give one six-star review 
 if such a mechanism were in place i'd use my six-star review on this graphic novel it was lovely and clear it had a strong emotional impact without being sugary or uncomfortable it was eye-opening without being preachy or didactic i read the whole thing in less than three hours and i can honestly say i am better for the experience this series continues to blow me away loving it great art and really cool premise though it was a bit hard to follow at times definitely want to continue on with this comic series though i'm hoping volume 2 has more world building amazing i loved the strong unique characters the plot the humor the art and everything else really enjoyed this i especially loved how relatable kamala was and that she wasn't the typical comic book heroine that being said i did feel like some elements were a bit stereotypical and while this was a good intro to the characters/world/situation it wasn't as standout wow amazing as it could've been i'll definitely be continuing on with this comic series though very much looking forward to volume 2 damn this is probably the most profound story i've read in at least a couple of years comic or otherwise 
 keep in mind that this is a story about stories about beginnings and endings these things are close to my heart i'd been hearing good things about this book for ages so i finally decided to pick it up 
 i enjoyed it and appreciated the fact that it wasn't just another same-old superhero origin story but if i'm going to be completely honest here (and i always try to be completely honest) i'll also say that it didn't really thrill me either 
 part of the issue might be that i don't know *anything* about the original hero that the story is based on that can make it a lot harder to get into a story 
 but it's also fair to assume that this story didn't speak to me as strongly because the main character is a teenage muslim and a child of immigrants i don't *think* that's the case i dig a lot of books with female protagonists but i'll happily admit that it's a possibility 
 i'd happily read more of the series but i'm not going to run out and order them and even if this isn't my favorite comic ever i'm really glad it exists i have a bunch of comics i love i'm a straight white guy there's a ton of media tailor made to please me 
 the fact that this comic speaks to a lot of other people's interests and experiences instead of mine that doesn't hurt me at all in fact it delights me i love it huzzah for that let's do it ten times let's do it forever hilarious touching with beautiful art and an interesting ending 
 great for fans of vicious by ve schwab and rainbow rowell's fangirl (because the simon snow vibes were strong let's be real) a question that's been bothering me all morning is whether i have a moral right not to order a t-shirt with an offensive cartoon of the prophet muhammad (pbuh) and start wearing it until yesterday i would not have dreamed of doing such a thing which would have been gratuitously offensive to all my muslim friends but now i wonder if i'm only refraining from showing solidarity with the dead cartoonists because i'm afraid someone will shoot me 
 my intuitions are confused not doing something out of politeness and respect for other people's religious feelings is clearly right but not doing it out of craven cowardice is clearly wrong which principle applies here i hope some experts on ethical philosophy are preparing an answer 
 _________________________ 
 the comment thread has already become very long so may i just briefly summarize my main response 
 the suggestion i make here was inspired by the many public readings of the satanic verses held after the fatwa was issued against salman rushdie the purpose of those readings was to show solidarity with rushdie and demonstrate belief in the freedom of speech without them the publisher might well have decided that rushdie's book was too hot to handle establishing an extremely dangerous precedent it was generally held afterwards that the public readings had been a good thing 
 in this case people have also been quick to agree on the importance of solidarity everywhere you look you find the phrase je suis charlie but it seems to me that this is quite different from the response to the rushdie case when you hold up a sign saying je suis charlie you are not really taking any risk since you are not repeating the offensive material i'm just being logical here: the real way to say je suis charlie is to repeat one of the cartoons that got them firebombed and then shot down in cold blood like this one 
 for people who don't read french it really is quite funny the title charlie hebdo at the top is replaced by sharia hebdo the speech bubble says ""a hundred lashes if you don't die laughing"" 
 _________________________ 
 wastrel reminds me that charlie hebdo didn't just offend muslims after a couple of minutes of searching i found the following splendidly tasteless cover: 
 it took me a little while to figure it out but apparently the reference is to a mgr vingt-trois who had made some outspoken comments against gay marriage the headline says ""mgr vingt-trois has three daddies"" (i am guessing this may allude to the children's book jennifer has two daddies) and the speech bubbles say ""the father"" ""the son"" and ""the holy ghost"" [yann in #307 says this is not quite right: the cover refers to a heated public debate on adoption by homosexual couples where the catholics who were campaigning against it used the slogan ""un papa et une maman"" (""one daddy and one mommy"")] 
 or if you're looking for outrageous and inappropriate anti-israeli humor: 
 the headline says ""already christmas in palestine"" the arrow pointing left says ""costume for israeli child"" the arrow pointing right says ""costume for palestinian child"" 
 but this even more outrageous cover which has been widely reprinted is not genuine ch: it's a parody by joe le corbeau an associate of the notorious racist comedian dieudonne i was fooled as were many newspapers [thank you again yann for catching this] 
 speech bubble: ""1 million reduction on the 6 in exchange for palestine"" 
 _________________________ 
 people who want to see more examples of charlie hebdo covers should look at yann's review these guys were really funny and disrespectful about everything: the muslims yes but at least as much the israelis the us the russians the french the germans the extreme right the catholic church and pretty much anything else you can think of 
 i'm very sorry that they had to be killed in this horrible way before i ever got around to looking at their work it should have been easier to get my attention 
 _________________________ 
 the cover for the latest issue which is due out tomorrow: 
 ""all is forgiven""you gotta hand it to them these guys really have a sense of humor 
 _________________________ 
 even though the new issue is already out in france it won't be on sale here until tomorrow the local papers can talk about nothing else the print run has been increased twice from one million to three million and then to five million and supply is still not meeting demand people in paris are queuing up outside the newsagents before they open and a few minutes later every copy has been sold 
 tribune de geneve reproduces one of the cartoons on its front page below a crowd of robot-like commuters are all intently reading their copies of charlie hebdo above the four murdered cartoonists sit on a cloud and remark c'est dur d'etre aime par des cons (""it's hard to be loved by idiots"") this is a reference to one of ch's most famous covers where the prophet muhammad (pbuh) weeping is saying the same thing 
 _________________________ 
 you can't get copies here for love or money though admittedly i haven't yet explored the first alternative according to the ever-reliable tribune the station newsstand was all sold out by 530 am 
 well we live right next door to la gare de cornavin - it's literally a two minute walk i will try getting up very early tomorrow morning if necessary i will propose to the woman behind the counter 
 _________________________ 
 i finally managed to obtain a copy of the survivor's number and have been looking at it this evening it's very moving 
 here was the bit i liked most which doesn't seem to have been widely remarked on it's a paragraph from the tribute piece by zineb el rhazoui the woman who wrote the text for the wonderful 
 vie de mahomet 
 : 
 allah akbar 
 before they executed the team the killers shouted twice ""god is great"" well no fuckwits if he really existed do you think he would have let your terminal stupidity extinguish the brilliant minds of wolinski cabu honore charb tignous bernard maris elsa cayat and mustapha ourrad allah akbar was charb's war-cry the greeting he used in mails and smss ""allah akbar do you think you could have your copy ready for tomorrow"" one day i remember we were teasing him at the office: ""charb stop yelling that the day they arrive to kill you we won't know if it's a joke"" and they did arrive at charlie we knew that humor was something very serious 
 [my translation]_________________________ 
 i had never even heard of nahed hattar until i read just now that he had been murdered for publishing what certain islamic militants considered to be a blasphemous cartoon to save you the trouble of going to google image search here it is 
 apparently the title is ""the god of daesh""; haider (messages 1527 and 1529) has kindly provided a translation god starts by addressing the bearded gentleman in bed with the two babes saying ""good evening abu saleh do you need anything"" 
 abu saleh replies (first speech bubble) ""yes o lord bring me a cup of wine and tell gabriel to bring me some cashews then send a boy to clean the floor and take out the empty dishes with you"" he adds (second speech bubble) ""and don't forget to build a door in this tent so next time you can knock before you come in glory be to you"" 
 that is really funny i have a book i wrote on goodreads wooot so exciting 
 is it douchy of me to rate it 5 stars ah whatever :) 
 this is released early december i wish these could be like a thousand pages long ''i can't have a kid following me around all day'' 
 ''i'm not a kid i'm a shark'' 
 pouahaha what a story what witty dialogs filled with humour adventure magic and friendship it will certainly charm and entertain the hell out of you this title used to be a dnf of mine before i decided to give it a second shot glad i did what made me stop reading it the first time around was the graphics because this is a style that never appealed to me but truth is it just grows on you as do the characters and every other element 
 nimona huge bear hugs to you ballister you've got my admiration goldenloin i want your hair noelle stevenson i wish you'd write a sequel or an happy-ever-after epilogue i want to see ballister & goldenloin kiss 
 i loved it lovely and amazing 
 re-read this in may 2016 with my little son 
 my thoughts 
 if i could buy everyone in america a copy of this book i would i feel like this is something i will go back to and reread a few times but i am slightly terrified to do so first off let's be clear i'm a big soppy fan of gaiman's work 
 secondly i've read the sandman series several times before so this is more a record of my fond re-reading and musing about this story rather than some sort of objective review 
 but if you've read any of my other reviews that won't come as a surprise 
 i think it's been a full ten years since the last time i've read this series and given that my memory is well to put it plainly quite shit i get to experience the series with a fairly fresh set of eyes at this point 
 the first thing that i notice is that the art is different that i remember i remember it being darker and grittier more real and more surreal at the same time 
 but that i'm expecting is the lens of corrective memory at play in reality the art seems more (for lack of a better word) cartoony the colors are bolder more garish than i remember 
 note: i had the same experience recently when i re-read watchmen so i'm suspecting this is an issue with me rather than the comic or perhaps i'm remembering the later parts of the comic more vividly 
 the other thing i'm surprised to see is that both john constantine and a few members of the dc cannon show up in this first book mostly just brief walk-ons but martian manhunter is there and we see arkham asylum and the scarecrow 
 these things don't detract from the story i can say that for a fact because on my earlier reads when i hadn't read many comics so i didn't know who many of those characters were but i have to say reading through this time they kinda surprised me 
 you see i think of the sandman series as being well kinda self-contained that's not the right way of putting it really as the story is hugely vast it's sprawling and lovely and mythically rich 
 i guess what i'm saying here is that while it seems perfectly natural that sandman exists in the same world as odin and puck and eurydice having batman in that cosmology even by association feels really odd to me and the more i think of it it's strangely off-putting 
 that said i'm fairly certain these dc cameos were early things and weren't repeated extensively throughout the rest of the series 
 as for this first book it makes for both a great story in itself and a great start to the larger series that's not a common thing 
 is it worth your time 
 absolutely 
 i don't care if you don't read comics you should read this series 
 and if you *do* read comics you cannot consider yourself well-read until you have sandman under your belt seriously i didn't read this until last year i saw the film about six months later i'm a new convert still radiant with that 'just converted' glow 
 along with the sandman graphic novels this is my favourite work in the medium (zenith and preacher get honourable mentions) watchmen wins over all of the other candidates in ambition this is a work of vast ambition it doesn't deliver on every level it isn't perfect but it contains so much that succeeds and comes so close to fulfilling its promises that it would be churlish to mention any failings 
 alan moore is a great writer he's not a great writer for comics he's a great writer period who happens to have made the graphic novel his medium watchmen is at times literary funny erudite tragic exciting intriguing it's written for intelligent grown-up readers 
 the plot sprawls it's convoluted it spans generations and a large cast what keeps it together are the deeply personal stories on various scales its scope was what kept it from the big screen for so long and in truth the movie (whilst good fun and well done i thought) is just a 2d projection of this complex multi-dimensional work that same complexity is stopping me from doing it justice in this short review rather than try i'm just going to back off the grandiose praise and return to the punchline: 
 this is a fun read it's exciting the artwork rocks it's as deep as that hole alice fell down but you never notice you're falling pick it up read it with pride if someone sneers at you for reading a comic-book hit them with it it's nice and fat

  remember remember the fifth of november 
 this tpb edition collects the original 10 comic book issues then divided in the graphic novel in three chapters 
 creative team: 
 writer: alan moore 
 illustrator: david lloyd 
 valiant vericity 
 remember remember the fifth of november the gunpowder treason and plot; i know of no reason why the gunpowder treason should ever be forgot 
 it's one of the first sentences that came to mind when you think about the masterpiece by alan moore & david lloyd and certainly something quite easy to remember each year on the mentioned date 
 however the most powerful quote that sticks to my mind is 
 people should not be afraid of their governments governments should be afraid of their people 
 that quote resumes the power of this story 
 story of one man 
 one man who can be everybody 
 everybody is special everybody everybody is a hero a lover a fool a villain everybody everybody has their story to tell 
 and the story of ""v"" is one very powerful to tell 
 good evening london i thought it time we had a little talk are you sitting comfortably then i'll begin 
 vigorous vocality 
 this is my favorite graphic novel ever 
 one of the first impacts when i read reading this graphic novel the first time it was when i realized that you don't start to read in the beginning of the story 
 no the plan of ""v"" is so carefully crafted that when the government think that he started he is already finishing it 
 v you're almost finished aren't you 
 it's very likely that by now you may have watched the film and it's a very good adaptation i liked it a lot and it's one of my favorite movies are there differences oh yes but honestly as a hardcore alan moore's fan i think that the changes are good thinking that film is a different format than comic book and therefore some things can be changed and still delivering the same powerful message 
 there's no flesh or blood within this cloak to kill there's only an idea ideas are bulletproof 
 however if you are a truly v for vendetta's fan like me you must read the graphic novel at some point or you will be missing a lot 
 vehement vitalism 
 knowledge like air is vital to life like air no one should be denied it 
 it's a wonderful joy to watch how alan moore put everywhere the letter ""v"" in the titles of the chapters just to mention an example 
 also david lloyd is a very creative partner of moore making into art many original concepts like a chapter made entirely in the form a music sheet 
 wonderful concepts that you only can get in the format of a graphic novel 
 vendetta validity 
 if i take off that mask something will go away forever be diminished because whoever you are isn't as big as the idea of you 
 i am a huge fan of alan moore's work and i have the luck to find a lot of his work not only the quite known examples like watchmen and this very graphic novel v for vendetta but also his entire runs of swamp thing top ten tom strong promethea fashion beast along with great issues like for the man who has everything the killing joke whatever happened with the man of tomorrow etc 
 and i loved to read everything and i have to say that my favorite work by alan moore is this graphic novel v for vendetta 
 i think the strongest issue that convince me to realize that v for vendetta is my own personal favorite graphic novel but also my own personal favorite work by alan moore is because it's that each little detail on the story was so carefully done so carefully thought so carefully presented 
 and that's the beautiful irony of all 
 since this is a story about chaos but it's done with a precision where nothing is left to chance everything is where that's supposed to be no more or less than needed to tell the story 
 and threrefore my own personal opinion is that this is his masterpiece in the middle of an universe of masterpieces written by alan moore 
 not only is a strong political story but also an impressive artwork 
 also the terrorist known as ""v"" is one of the best characters ever made in literature 
 what was done to me created me it's a basic principle of the universe that every action will create an equal and opposing reaction 
 that will be all you may return to your labors 
 england prevails that was kind of odd i tried to go into it with low expectations and not compare it with the lunar chronicles books since it's a different format but most of the characters didn't seem like themselves (especially thorne) and the tone was drastically different 
 i did love how well iko's personality came through in her narration and it was fun to see familiar characters together again (except i really wasn't huge on thorne here he turned into a wimpy tween boy and went from being my favorite character to my least favorite) there's not much with scarlet kai or wolf but they do come in at the end most of the plot focuses on cinder getting ready to abdicate her throne to form a republic while iko hunts down rogue lunar special operatives and meets up with cress & thorne i adore iko and wanted to see more of her with kinney so that was a fun part and i really did love the parts with cinder 
 i've told a lot of adults and grandparents to read the lunar chronicles because they're fun for all ages but this book definitely felt like i was too old for the target audience at times a lot of scenes were either cringeworthy or just not the same characters and i really wasn't that big on the illustrations either 
 so i think this will be really fun for the right audience but it's not something i'd recommend for everyone who loved the lunar chronicles the story and characters aren't a very strong continuation of the book series -- this graphic novel is kind of doing its own thing now and that's not bad i'm just pretty neutral on it overall this was so awesome it was like reading the movie a fan gave this to me as a gift at nerdcon this past weekend i didn't know it existed until then 
 apparently it's based off a jonathan coulton song but despite the fact that i'm a coulton fan i'd never heard it still i wasn't terribly surprised i tend to live under a heavy rock most of the time 
 despite not knowing the song it was based on i loved the book i read it in a restaurant the day after the convention and got all teary i tried to cover this up by pretending that i was really emotionally involved in my cobb salad but i don't think it worked 
 it's a really great book and when i got done i read it to my two little boys (and got teary again) they loved it and wanted to hear it a second time 
 so i read it to them again 
 * * * 
 update: tonight (one day after our initial reading) i found my older boy (6) reading this book to himself then my littlest boy (2) carried it over to me and said ""read daddy read daddy read"" 
 so yeah it's a hit i rarely write gr reviews but i almost didn't pick this up because of some of the reviews i've seen so i wanted to add my five stars 
 this is a quiet book much of the action is observed rather than experienced by the protagonists but the impact it has on them is deeply felt if you're looking for grand resolutions or ""boy did i learn my lesson"" closure you won't find it here and that's exactly as it should be 
 this one summer beautifully and poignantly captures a particular moment in girlhood when we begin to understand the way the world sees women and begin to make our own judgments about how we wish to be perceived ourselves watching rose struggle with the idea of wanting to be a ""cool girl"" and of what it means to be seen as a ""bad girl"" or ""slut"" isn't comfortable but if feels wholly real the way she and windy soak up the opinions and behaviors of those around them the way they take those messages into themselves and their burgeoning self-consciousness as they leave childhood behind is honestly and painfully drawn but never skews preachy (and the idea that this book in any way condones slut shaming is utterly absurd) f*cking fabulous more like 45 stars really enjoying this series it just keeps getting better and better this question is a reaction to the sight of this: 
 but it could be asked in response to seeing many of the other creatures appearing in this story 
 it's got unicorn people 
 torsoless sex workers 
 teevee-head people 
 seahorse people 
 and  this 
 the story centers around a second timeless question: 
 why these two assholes that's who: 
 these incredibly attractive characters are supposed to hate each other due to the longstanding war between their respective peoples but they fall in love in that romantical star-crossed way; a classic tale of 'he's got horns she's got wings' and they make a baby together where all of the grand beauty of childbirth is depicted 
 and 
 despite how really freaking beautiful they are their love is considered treason and the baby an abomination in the eyes of both their people so the family is forced to flee to the furthest corners of the galaxy pursued by a number of bounty hunters/assassins and also a lie-detector cat 
 the third question is why did i wait so long to read this it had been recommended to me a number of times by a number of people and i'd always kept it in the back of my mind to read ""someday"" but if i'd known it would be this good i would have kicked myself in the ass towards it a long time ago 
 this is a triumph of art story and concept it's funny as hell and i love the characters - not just our two protagonists but even those who are in pursuit of them which results in very conflicted loyalties but it's one of the strengths of this story - that it's not all black/white good/evil or in the words of the book: some monsters are worse than others 
 there's great character development and worldbuilding and i'm going to try to pace myself with reading these so i don't end up with another chew situation on my hands where i plow through 10 books and then have to endure the agony of waiting for my next fix (i say that but i've already read the second one and bought the third and there's only five so far so i will likely break this vow) 
 in any event i'm hooked 
 marko and alana 4eva i'm just saying i would write the hell out of a rick and morty story morality is a fickle bitch 
 this is simply put iconic when any one mentions comics/graphic novels the first thought that enters is an image of the watchmen i think there is a strong reason for it it made me question morality on a scale rarely seen in fiction indeed when considering the characters it is incredibly hard to consider any of them truly good or truly bad they are simply people who are convinced that they are right 
 take rorschach he follows the law to the very letter but never stops to consider for a single moment that there are actually problems with the law; yes he is violent but his unique form of vigilante justice is an embodiment of the law's order he works outside the law to bring the law in a strange sort of way then is he not worthy of the justice he administers does he go too far is he too not worthy of punishment these are hard questions to answer because there are no real answers there is simply opinion and debate; it all depends on how you view the world one thing remains certain though the characters in here are so devastatingly flawed 
 on the other hand you have ozymandias who looks at the big picture he sees the world for what it is and tries to plan accordingly except unlike rorschach he attempts to tackle the bigger problems to many he is simply the villain in reality he is as obscurely heroic as rorschach and just as morally grey who has the right to sacrifice life who has the right to dictate people and make such a monumental decision well nobody really yet ozymandias' actions essentially save the world who can question his results his methods are clearly debatable though it was the only route open to him there is simply no quantifiable right or wrong in this world; there is only neutrality and hypocrisy 
 this is where the self-actualised comedian comes in unlike rorschach he is fully aware of his faults and corruptness unlike ozymandias he perceived that the world has no hope so what does he do he embraces himself and indulges in his own overbearing personality he knows what he is and what he reflects so he relishes in his own nature he offers no guilt and feels no remorse: he simply doesn't care about anything or anyone in this he is more neutral than any other character; he isn't in denial; he isn't convinced he is right: he just knows that the world is essentially doomed 
 so why not enjoy it it's all a joke after all right 
 there are so many conflicting and self-defeating morals in here never before have i read something in which so many people have been wrong but at the same time so absolutely right then there is jon the so called god of america the supreme dr manhattan he is something else entirely he could have changed everything his power was practically limitless but he barely lifted a finger until the last possible moment and the pointing of that finger was an action that was both terrible and completely necessary the answer became clear as to the question of his inaction: why should he bother with man the comedian got to him in this; he saw something in humanity that wasn't worth saving rorschach saw it too but he still tried to salvage the remnants of society through brutalising the brutalisers dr manhattan however was simply too complex and too important to waste his time on the common man he came through in the end though surprisingly well kind of i thought he'd watch the world burn but humanity did have another protector albeit one who committed necessary evils 
 this was such a great piece of fiction; i don't think i could ever do it justice in a review parts of this felt too intricate to put into words this is a complete subversion of the entire genre and a full questioning of the flawed and hypocritical nature of humankind it is a piece of work that will simply put never be forgotten by those that have experienced its mortifying splendour this is the first comic book i've seriously considered to be great; it has become a gateway for me to explore the comic book universe that i've barely touched in the past 
 so i ask you this: what comic book should i read next can any other comic really compare to this updated review: 
 *giggle snorts* 
 rereading is often a humbling experience    i've been forced to admit that my memory isn't what it once was and never is that more apparent then after a reread *kicks aluminum can* 
 i won't bore you with all the things i'd forgotten but there were a few things that made a bigger impact this time around: 
 how does one bind a god to a person 
 and this: 
 1 who was the first arcanic lord 
 2 who is the other potential host 
 also that other old god is after maika b/c she's some kind of superior host so does that mean every old god that slithers out of their cage is going to be after her as well

 one of the things i'm discovering that i love about graphic novels is the way they hit the ground running the creators don't toy with you the way writers of traditional books sometimes do--they don't have the time to draw out anything beyond the most important secrets 
 monstress for example opens with a slave auction and the inquiries made about lot 819 reveal the specific brand of prejudice that governs this world you learn of a war that seems to have ended while the thriving slave trade continues to fan the flames of hate 
 there's no guesswork and any confusion about terminology resolves itself quickly 
 i friggin' love it 
 our heroine maika halfwolf is the girl currently up for bid but (once again) it quickly becomes obvious that she's only there b/c she wants to be 
 yep you read that correctly: dollface wants to be auctioned off like livestock and not only that she's banking on the cumaea a witchy faction of humans crashing the shindig and claiming the arcanics a race of beings with natural magic for themselves 
 dun dun dunnnnnn    for research purposes    oo 
 just b/c graphic novels tend to be more straightforward than their picture-free counterparts doesn't mean they aren't twisty 
 maika you see is looking for information 
 before the war ended something happened (was done) to her    something that has recently begun to affect her in ways she can't control it's made her dangerous and she's desperate for answers 
 along the way she picks up a two-tailed sasshole of a cat a girl child with a fox tail and an angry dialogue with the thing that plagues her 
 every aspect of monstress drew me in--the characters the world-building the plot all of it everything else became a distraction to be ignored i didn't give any thought to the why of it as i tore through the beautifully illustrated pages but at the end of the first volume liu wrote a letter about her intent when she began this series: 
    the root of my desire    was to tell a story about what it means to be a survivor a survivor not just of a cataclysmic war but of racial conflict and its antecedent: hatred and to confront the question: how does one whom history has made a monster escape her monstrosity how does one overcome the monstrousness of others without succumbing to a rising monstrousness within 
 all i can say is well done lady well done 
 monstress by marjorie m liu is the first collection (volumes 1 - 6) of her new graphic novel series that is part steampunk part fantasy and all awesome maika's struggle to control the monster inside her is inspiring to watch b/c that's what it was: a struggle but surrender is a concept she threatens to rip out of herself every time it whispers about the easier path and as she slowly gains the upper hand you can't help but sing ""all i do is win"" under your breath b/c she'd rather die than quit highly recommended oooh goodreads choice awards semifinalist for best graphic novel what will happen 
 this is both very similar to and very different from adulthood is a myth 
 thematically much of the same ground is covered: procrastination social awkwardness the joy of comfortable clothes the irritants that go along with being female self image and the bullying inner voice we all have that keeps our ego in check 
 however while adulthood was a collection of unrelated cartoons (and not a graphic novel goodreads) this one contains some longer-form pieces where we get more insight into what makes sarah andersen tick which makes it a good companion book to introvert doodles: an illustrated collection of life's awkward moments as both address the difficulties the authors have with the world's expectations of being a social person to someone who is not naturally that way inclined and how much human interactions can suck 
 and as honest and laudable as i don't know how to be a person was i'm much more drawn to one of the other long-form pieces called sadie (how i learned to get over myself and love cats) which is about how she went from being alienated by the internet's catcentric obsession: 
 to accidentally becoming a crazy cat lady like the rest of us through the fuzzy mind-control of a loaner-cat named sadie 
 and now she is one of us 
 well done sadie more bodies for the calvary 
 as with adulthood there are plenty of scenarios very familiar to my own experiences some that i think are true for many: 
 some that i know are familiar to all the ladies out there: 
 and some that fall into the ""i thought i was the only one"" category: 
 there's also some nice giggle-pokery at insufferable people 
 and while i understand it is not the point she is making i am interpreting this to be a bold anti-bird stance which you know i'm on board with 
 so another fun and funny collection which only strengthens my resolve to be sarah andersen's bestie 
 sarraahhhhhh come to maaaaaaggie 
 although this will probably not be tolerated 
 *************************************************** 
 i did not turn my computer on once during the holiday weekend and it felt great but also very stressful so when i saw the first cartoon in this collection my heart recognized a kindred spirit: 
 thank you for putting my feelings into pictures sarah andersen 
 full review to come 
 ******************************** 
 someone plz gimmie a heads-up if this comes onto netgalley i bought this set for my boys a few christmasses back - but really i bought it for me 
 i've read the entire thing a few pages at a time over the course of a some months and i was sad to come to the last wonderfully bound hard cover 
 although i was sad to reach the end i also applaud bill watterson for knowing the power in ending something he quit while he was ahead and left us something golden it would lessen the work if he had carried on past the point the fire left him repeating old themes too many times and forcing us to watch as the life leached out of these beloved characters - perhaps even passing the torch on to contracted writers to continue milking the cash cow ad infinitum but he didn't thanks bill 
 calvin and hobbs captures a type of magic the humour dances between many levels brilliant visual comedy erudite observation poignant insight laugh out loud slap-stick and just damn feel-good stuff that touches everyone who has really lived 
 i fell into calvin and hobbes' world in my 30s and intend to keep dipping back in every time life gets me down

  goosebumps full of them reading this horror filled graphic novel during night-time turned out to be a terrifying idea yet i couldn't stop reading it was captivating i don't think i've even noted a single thing of my environment while reading it; there was only the book and i 
 there were five short stories in this book all of them contained a spooky or completely frightening plot that will keep you on the edge the author also managed to include suspense in the atmosphere however scary the story or characters might have appeared there was no possibility for me to interrupt my own reading the stories were short which means that never was i bored or waiting for something interesting to happen it's not often that i take the time to read and admire graphic novels and there are multiple styles of drawings that i am still not used to but this is one i found uniquely beautiful and would gladly see more of 
 the writing was simplistic but sincerely it worked with every single thing plus it is really on the illustrations - which were amazingly vivid and arresting too - that i was concentrated on and did not as i usually do have the reflex to observe and wonder if the author used repetition as well as some figures of speech from time to time 
 my own personal favorite was 'a lady's hands are cold' since at first i thought it to be a retelling of 'bluebeard' and was curious to see which path the story and main character will take plus the author noticeably surpassed herself with the graphics in that short story in question 
 it is true that i found this graphic novel to be one of the best i have ever read for how monopolized by it i was the whole reading time but there is something that displeased me inside it: every short story ended on a cliffhanger now that was frustrating at first i thought maybe i was missing something but then it happened again and again every time maybe some will not mind it but by how dark the endings were i did not approve of the hypotheses my mind was making for the characters 
 this is one graphic novel i highly recommend to every fan of dark fairy tales and graphic novels with eerie ambiences a truly too short for my liking book but impressive nonetheless 
 ps how am i ever going to be able to sleep tonight i have to get my head off worms wolves ghosts hair-raising monsters hiding under the bed friendship to the max fun and charming with a solid story and fantastic art i want more go to this now

 i don't laugh at books much don't get me wrong i am not averse to the emotion humans call ""happiness"" sometimes i will find myself smiling at an amusing book i have been known to chuckle even but this book ripped out my funny bone and started tickling me with it not only did i lol i was crying with laughter by page four page four i even took a picture of my laughter-tears as proof which i intended to use in this review but then i figured the internet had enough pictures of me already so that one will just be for me 
 but i will tell you that page four was not the end of my laughter-response this book made me indescribably happy much more than the typical ""messy art autobiography"" you find cluttering up the humor section along withlet's pretend this never happened: a mostly true memoir this is a book that finally understands what it's going to take to make me laugh 
 for example every single time she drew a dog i fell in love a little these are among the best dog drawings ever 
 if that's not a perfect trip into the mind of a dog i don't know what is 
 one more: 
 holy hell but that's comedy gold 
 there are other non-dog-related treasures; in particular the ""god of cake"" story and the goose story but i will leave you to discover those for yourself i know i have said in other reviews of internet-sensations-turned-book that i was glad to learn of the blog or site or whatever through the book but i never actually visited them after my revelation even if i really enjoyed the book maybe once or twice but then i would get distracted by other things and never follow through but with this one i am going to do the unprecedented are you ready for those of you who know me and my allergy to ""doing new things"" or even ""doing things like normal modern people do"" like owning a cellphone this is going to blow your minds i am going to ""follow"" a blog as the kids say and there i have just done it i think i don't know what all these buttons mean but i am fairly confident that i have just joined the ranks of the modern world brrrr it's chilly 
 speaking of chilly i will leave you with allie brosh's take on a dog in the snow: 
 i love her always i'm always willing to pick up an indie comic especially one written by a name i recognize this one did not disappoint 
 it's funny at times sweet at times pleasantly subversive without being heavy-handed or preachy 
 i'm reading through it with my little boy right now and he's enjoying it too hilarious and charming and relatable i absolutely loved the art style and the humor--it's a beautiful book that had me laughing out loud throughout the dynamic between the narrator and the main character was something i'd never seen before but it thought it was brilliant there were some aspects of the plot/worldbuilding that weren't fully developed but if you can just go along with it this is pretty close to perfect great art great story great characters great humor 
 so to recap: this was great if you need a graphic novel recommendation this read this i haven't read anything else by bryan lee o'malley yet but i will definitely be checking out the scott pilgrim series asap this book ripped out my heart and showed it to me several times my assistant introduced me to this book and i immediately fell in love 
 oh allie brosh where have you been all my life 
 oh you were on the internet and apparently all the cool kids have known about you for ages 
 here's a link to her website just in case you've been living under a rock like me: 
 http://hyperboleandahalfblogspotcom/ 
 go and read some 
 you can thank me later i'm impressed at how well this comic manages to maintain the overall tone of the show that's something i don't often see when a story tries to transition into a different medium more like 35 stars i thought the concept was really cool and interesting and i loved the art style but i wasn't a huge fan of the characters i didn't dislike them i just didn't particularly like them i am still interested in continuing this series though because i did enjoy it and i do really want to see what else happens with this premise i loved this it consistently had me laughing so hard i was almost crying i've been a huge fan of allie's blog for years and really the only reason i didn't give this 5 stars is because i'd already read quite a few of the ""chapters"" i still really recommend this though both to those who are new to allie's work and those already following her it's wonderful one more to go :) i loved the art style but the story didn't wow me as much as i was expecting review to come but man am i loving this series 
 okay time for a real review 
 it's hard to know where to begin 
 this series is all told from the pov of a girl detailing the events and adventures of her baby-years and before including the romantic forbidden love between her parents 
 it was not however love at first sight 
 but it's not all lovey-dovey stuff nor even lovey-punchy-with-a-rifle stuff there's also  this 
 and how much do i love alana not only for her dry wit 
 but also for her enthusiasm about books well okay one book in particular but still it's adorable especially because of this familiar scenario where you're talking about a book you love and your excitement gets in the way of your powers of articulation and you get this reaction to your blathering: 
 been there my friends 
 but also deep in my heart is lying cat 
 nooooo no killing lying cat lying cat is for snuggling 
 there was much peril for lying cat in this volume at one point i made an audible squeak not even embarrassed about it 
 i want my own lying cat i also want these things 
 anyway an excellent second part to a series that is quickly taking over my life and my heartspace 
 you're welcome book so glad to be a part of this journey woah i mean woah there are so many things to love about this comic the plot the atmosphere the characters the action the magic those things oh my what i've seen so far impressed me grandly and if it weren't because i highly wanted to review this book right away i would be right this moment halfway through the second volume goddamn cliffhanger loved it 
 now this comic is composed of so many elements that i never dreamed i would one day come to mightily admire such as monsters weird chimeras/creatures a futuristic or alternative setting and world and killings everywhere and all the time it just works the story follows not only the main characters with their baby but others - such as their pursuers - as well there's not a single uninteresting moment it's fast-paced it's imaginative creative amazingly drawn and there's one hell of a love story inside it 
 but it's not only that it's not only a love story or one about war and its consequences i see something big coming something important i can feel it and you'll feel it too i'm positive the soldiers with the help of some allies will save the world oops huge spoiler if i'm right ;) oooh goodreads choice awards semifinalist for best graphic novel what will happen 
 the sads shouldn't have hit me as hard as they did here since i'd already read more than half of this volume in its single-issue installments thanks to greg's generous indulgence of my impatience; presenting me with issues #37-40 back in november i thought i was prepared for anything this book had to throw at me but dammmit - issues #41 & #42 had their own griefs in store seriously - will these people (and assorted creatures) ever catch a break this is practically a thomas hardy-level escalation of tragedy and even though that's not what she's talking about here i had to laugh at this: 
 because this storyline is indeed ""hardy as shit"" and this was basically me the whole way through: 
 with a little 
 'i can't take any more scares sorrows' thrown in 
 obviously i am going to avoid spoilerses including spoilerses for previous volumes but apart from all the heartache this volume is full of the series' signature brand of ready-for-tattooing epigrams: 
 adult content: 
 and the parade of old friends new friends dead friends and soon-to-be-dead friends that have made this such an addictive journey and totally worth all the howling despair no lie 
 plus we get to witness hazel's first kiss in all its bittersweet glory: 
 it's spectacularly gutting and i loved every minute of it okay except for robot-peen that's still gross 
 and i am going to try really hard to wait for the next collected book to come out instead of giving in to the temptation of the single issues that are too short to really satisfy my intense cravings oh wait - do you have something to say 
 good didn't think so 
 ********************************************** 
 my goddamned heart 
 full review to come a couple weeks ago i read and reviewed chester brown's 
 paying for it 
  a book singularly concerned with separating love from sex brown forwards the idea that fewer problems arise if we segregate sex as completely as we can from the relational sphere he does this to such an extent that he proposes that sex is a pleasure best paid for and made entirely transactional it's not spoiling anything to say that brown as he represents himself in the book is more wholly concerned with sex than he is with relationship despite the author's protestations readers will almost certainly feel some sorrow for him as he shows himself unable to enjoy the manifold blessing of romantic relationships we watch his philosophy play itself out and wonder: is it enough 
 craig thompson's latest work habibi may function well as a companion piece to paying for it only emphasizing the inverse of brown's work: love that excludes sex thompson balances several themes throughout habibi's unfolded history of two runaway slaves but perhaps chief among these is an exploration of love of true love--and how it can exist flourish and grow even in the absence of sexual fulfillment chester brown focused on his women as pure objects as receptacles for his sexuality to the exclusion of their ability to exist as full-orbed human persons with dreams hopes loves or even (for the most part) personalities; thompson on the other hand uses the objectification of his characters to craft them into noble persons deserving of dignity of hope of love 
 thompson walks a narratively perilous path pushing envelopes with his characters that draw out the terror of the human spirit balancing against the redeeming power of a full-bodied and depth-defying love his choices are dangerous because as his characters participate in choices that may seem abominable--and in some sense they are abominable choices made so by their sheer necessity--thompson risks the reader losing interest in the plight of these two characters still the compassionate reader won't be able to help investment into their two stories which are really just one story 
 in habibi thompson introduces us to his heroine dodola as she is sold into marriage to a scribe who will teach her to read to understand the power of stories dodola is nine and thompson does not spare us the aftermath of her wedding night what's worse is that the anguish of such a scene such an experience is small in comparison to the fate dodola and her adopted son zam will live out thompson makes a cruel god for his world and creations; yet it is in his cruelty that we see the beauty of dodola and zam spill out in habibi's nearly seven hundred pages 
 habibi is a major work in comics literature and thompson's first since the nearly-six-hundred-page 
 blankets 
  comparisons will be obvious both works traffic deeply in religious language and colour their texts in displays of sacred ferocity both explore the boundaries and need for love and human contact both play with non-linearity in storytelling skipping back and forth and only revealing the past in time to illuminate the future these two creations are very much the work of the same author and it's a joy to see his voice maturing 
 still for those hoping for another blankets thompson has something very much different in store in both tone and scope habibi is an entirely more ambitious work we see thompson redressing things that were focal points in blankets in the former book raina is depicted in such sacred light by thompson that she becomes the ultimate example of female sexual objectification--all with the best intentions of course but when young craig deifies her he makes her into little better than a graven image in habibi however when dodola is depicted nude (which is often) she is wholly human this is a triumph of thompson's technique for in the midst of the narrative she is being wholly objectified yet these instances serve only to drive home her humanity for the majority of those within habibi's narrative landscape dodola exists much as chester brown's ideal woman--she is merely a receptacle for their sexual advances thompson however prevents the reader from seeing her in this way by refusing to give her the visual lyricism her bestowed upon raina both are sacred and both are holy but the one is made so by her sexuality while the other is made so by her personhood it's a difficult line to draw and that thompson illustrates it so well ably demonstrates why he is one the leading auteurs in the medium 
 [even odds that thompson actually tried this out at some point in his life] 
 habibi is a book marked by rape slavery castration forced marriages the murder of children harems and love while in its murk and depths it may not seem possible that the last of these--love--should so completely over-power all else but this is the case love is not always victorious but it is always glorious the love of these two for each other is simultaneously heart-rending and heart-warming and it is for this reason that i won't soon forget that when habibi asks of love without sex is it enough the answer though quiet in the face of the world's roar is defiant: yes it is 
 note 
 one word about the art: it's manifestly evident why this book took thompson six years to create beyond the research necessary to develop such a well-rounded story that borrows so heavily from the qur'an habibi's art is a wonder the intricacy with which thompson approaches his pages staggers the imagination--especially when one recalls the stress-injury pain in his hand that he related in carnet de voyage so many of the pages of habibi feature delicate ornamentation pulled from islamic culture ornament that would take hours to complete here's an example: 
 these are corners from four different pages showing the kind of decoration that thompson wrapped around entire pages at first i presumed that he drew this just the once and reproduced the designwork for subsequent pages this photo though shows that each page's work was distinct that thompson took the care to patiently (or impatiently it hardly matters) draw out these magnificent designs helps flesh out just how much effort was poured into this production the six years shows and thompson outdoes anything i'd seen from him previously 
 [review courtesy of good ok bad] 45 stars ahhhhhh 
 series review (combined with an anime series review) will be on my channel in the coming weeks once i've finished watching the show :) a very low-key beautiful story with amazing artwork also very canadian it was the evening before the inauguration and i was looking for something to read something that would fortify me against the dark rhetoric of soon-to-be president trump i decided on march 3 the final volume of congressman john lewis' graphic autobiographical account of the civil rights struggle and it turned out to be an excellent choice 
 i read half of the book that night from the birmingham church bombing in september of '63 to the failure of the mississippi freedom democratic party to seat their delegates at the convention in august of '64 i read of lewis' painstaking organizing efforts during the dangerous ""mississippi freedom summer"" when the brave young activists of sncc labored to register black people to vote afterward i reflected on the recent attempts to suppress the black vote with voter id laws--in wisconsin in north carolina in florida in texas--and i realized how vital to the health of democracy the courage of heroes like john lewis can be 
 i finished the book the next morning waiting for the inauguration to begin i read of ""bloody sunday"" the attempt of civil rights activists to march from selma to montgomery for voting rights and how it ended on a bridge in selma when non-violent marchers were beaten by the billy clubs of alabama state troopers how john lewis himself was beaten severely suffering a concussion and other injuries i read too how america's horror at such gratuitous violence led to the passing of the voting rights act of 1965 
 soon the inauguration began and i heard our new president speak he spoke of ""american carnage"" and--although it was a different ""carnage"" he spoke of--i couldn't help thinking of four little girls blown to pieces by a bomb in birmingham of the murdered civil rights workers chaney goodman and schwerner and of john lewis himself: sprawled unconscious bleeding from the head on the pavement of the edmund pettus' bridge 
 our new president continued to speak he reminded us that ""whether we are black or brown or white we all bleed the same red blood of patriots we all enjoy the same glorious freedoms"" i thought again of the black voters of wisconsin north carolina florida and texas and of young black men dead by police violence on the streets of ferguson baltimore cleveland cincinnati and chicago then i thought of the recent confirmation hearings of attorney general jefferson beauregard sessions how he defended vigorously the concept of voter id laws and i began to pray that what our president said about our freedoms may hold true that it may continue to be true 
 amid the uncertainty of this new era there is one thing of which i am certain: if we wish to preserve--or to gain--those ""glorious freedoms"" for all we must follow the heroic example of congressman john lewis and people like him reading the three volumes of this excellent autobiography is a very good place to start love the humour and how dark twisted and complex it is getting so excited to continue awesome i mean seriously the movie will be coming out soon as i write this in late feb 2017 but i read the comic in english translation over 20 years ago and loved it i also read the sequel and watched the associated anime that it inspired it is a fantastic universe in a sort of dystopian future that poses the same basic questions as the i robot series by asimov - how will artificial intelligence change human kind and at what moment is an android sentient a must read before the movie comes out - or after you watch it 
 this is truly one of the greatest mangas i have the kodansha bilingual version and as much as i find it entertaining that masamune shirow leaves a ton of editorial explanations of his drawings and ideas (and excuses sometimes for shortcuts he takes in the story) the type is really really really tiny that being said bantu is a total badass and major motoko kusanagi is an extremely sexy cyborg built over a human body with those human memories buried in her as her ""ghost"" her adventures as a super agent are fun and engaging as well as sexy and occasionally quite violent - nsfw and 18+ for the most part the anime was excellent let's hope the live action version lives up to the hype as well they will surely not be able to cover the variety of adventures in this volume so it will be interesting to see whether they use the anime as a basis or go off on a different story altogether there are many possibilities which is one of the things which is so great about this manga 
 the film - like the anime - is a sort of prequel to this volume but it is absolutely amazing this review contains *spoilers* 
 i've been meaning to read this graphic novel for a few months now and i'm really happy that i finally did 
 it had me hooked right from the beginning and wouldn't let go till the end i loved it 
 this story follows nimona a shapeshifter and ballister blackheart a villain with a vendetta 
 they are partnering up as sidekick and supervillain and are about to wreak some serious havoc 
 their main mission: prove to the kingdom that sir ambrosius goldenloin and his buddies at the institution of law enforcement and heroics aren't the heroes everyone thinks they are 
 reading nimona was such an exhilarating journey i felt as if i was right there with ballister blackheart and nimona on their missions they work so well together and their dialogue left me with the biggest smile on my face 
 ""what do you mean there are rules why would you follow the rules isn't that the whole point of being a villain that you don't follow the rules"" 
 i loved nimona as a character her enthusiasm relatable humor and her story really added depth to the plot 
 she is as unique as the storyline 
 i also enjoyed ballister and goldenloin even though they definitely had a complicated journey at the beginning i really liked them together 
 they reminded me a bit of baz and simon from carry on -- i love them with all my heart 
 oh and doctor blitzmeyer was a very pleasant surprise i enjoyed reading about her and i would have loved it if noelle stevenson had added her journey to uncover the anomalous energy enhancer 
 that ending left me in tears i couldn't believe it when nimona didn't get a happy ending i was incredibly sad about it that was such an emotional part of the story i was just listening to sad music with tears in my eyes 
 ""despite this tragedy we remain united we will stay strong and we will rebuild"" 
 but i kept thinking (until the very last page) 'what about nimona she was left all alone at the end' 
 i was so thankful for the epilogue i really thought for a second there that noelle stevenson would leave it on a cliffhanger 
 so i've heard great things about this graphic novel but the one that really got my attention was rainbow rowell's blurb on the cover: 
 ""full of humor and heart"" 
  i couldn't agree more with her she summed it perfectly up in just those 5 words 
 nimona was an adventurous heart-gripping and humorous story -- with amazing artwork i love it 
 definitely a book that lived up to the hype

 this review and more can be found on my blog this just in : p bryant fails hip graphic novel test 
 fun home a cripplingly hip graphic novel is 
 yes 
 it's 
 yes 
 well let's see it's you know all right good yes nods head hummphs into beard pulls earlobe raises eyebrows waves hands in a vague direction shifts about in seat you know don't get me wrong it was good yes cool clever really hip i mean really as far as i can tell my hipometer needs a new battery i think; it was not the least bit funny but that's not such a bad thing and 
 stares at ceiling 
 has sudden thought 
 hey you don't think alison bechdel will read this do you she's not one of those goodreads authors who suddenly jump up like a damned jack in a box and scare the jesus out of you and tell you they devoted five years of hard graft to this work you've just more or less sneered at and damned with the faintest possible praise i really hope not that's not happened to me yet but i know it's happened to a few of you and it's not pretty some of you were mildly traumatised i saw it with my own eyes you had to be led away to a quiet good place with a small cat to stroke 
 so fun room it was all sweetly sad and worthy painfully so all about alison's father who was this closet gay or bi living the whole of his life in a small pennsylvanian town so his temperament ran towards the dour and repressed and the sublimating-everything-into-his-house-restoration and then lo shazam alison figures this out and also - double shazam that she herself is gay and then they become a lot closer and then stuff happens but not that much stuff i wanted more stuff i'm unreasonable 
 i read books for stuff you know do you know that feeling you get when you listen to your favourite album or piece of music and you're just wiped out you sit there you think you imagine you dream it's cathartic it's purifying and cleansing; it's almost liberating do you know what i mean this piece of profoundness; this thing of beautiful art was that and more 
 i'm literally lost for words i'm not going to give you a plot summary that would be to do this a great injustice this was transcendental i cannot define it or explain its effect on me it's just stunning it surpasses most things i've read the scope is unprecedented and brilliant dreams are endless and limitless; they have the potential to be anything or do anything nothing can end them who knew a comic book could be so visionary and spiritual at the same time as presenting an exciting story 
 gaiman has done something really special in these pages and that's coming from someone who hasn't read anything in the sandman series (yet) i fully intend to read it through which will no doubt cause me to revisit this review so i'm considering this a primary review an initial statement before i've read the work that goes with this prologue so i will be updating this in the future even if it's many many years from now it's not like i'm going to stop using goodreads anytime soon this website is slowly becoming a part of me 
 i have to mention the artwork literary quality aside writing aside plot allegories and symbolism aside this was simply stunning by its own it is just extraordinary the covers are so damn cool i'm amazed at it i became lost in it i probably still am 
 i wonder how i will feel about this once i've read the rest of the series will i like it more will i appreciate it less only time will tell but one thing's for sure my faith has been restored in neil gaiman after american gods and stardust i've been very wary of him this makes me want to try some of his other books but i do have my priorities right: sandman series first and novels later

 ly 23 ywlyw 2016 reindeer boy is the perfect romantic christmassy book 
 it's impossible not to be familiar with cassandra jean's work if you're a die-hard fan of cassandra clare's the mortal instruments her artwork is featured in both the bane chronicles and tales from the shadowhunter academy she also illustrated shadowhunter tarot cards among other things 
 she has quite an original style i would recognize her work anywhere in fact just by looking at the cover of this book i knew immediately that cassandra jean was the artist 
 oh what a charming charming story heart-warming really and with such diverse characters 
 quincy's life is pretty normal--before cupid arrives he's the new kid cute really good looks instantly popular 
 but wait he's got antlers say what antlers must be the new it look strangely enough he seems to be very interested in quincy particularly almost as if he knows her already 
 despite an ongoing crush on conway her friend she starts to develop interest in cupid--but really who could not succumb to the charms of that innocent mysterious fellow 
 and what's with the bumps on her forehead what is happening to her nothing like this happened before cupid's arrival 
 extraordinary artwork okay so maybe miss jean could work a little more on her backgrounds because most of the time they are pretty banal but she knows impressively well how to draw human beings (and animals) without them looking stereotypical like i said she has a special style 
 it really is a perfect read for the holidays lovely from start to finish you'll breeze through it yet it's memorable enough that you'll remember it for a long time to come 
 blog | youtube | twitter | instagram | google+ | bloglovin' this book is the perfect antidote to the ""graphic novels aren't real books"" crowd's poison it takes full advantage of the medium (lgm with the local boy scout troops) and just runs with it this story could not have been told as well or as broadly using a more traditional narrative structure and at the end there is a perfect collapse - the three storylines streamline so perfectly into one message about cultural acclimatization and race-shame and why it is bad but not in a preachy way it is not rah-rah asia it is just quietly ""don't be an asshole; this is who you are"" so it doesn't exclude roundeye from appreciating the message like me at chinese new year at my ex's i know what you are saying about me grandma tsui 
 so the stories include the traditional tale of the monkey king: 
 a very tasteful depiction of a chinese gentleman come to america: 
 and this cute young chinese-american boy with a perm: 
 that's what the art looks like and if i didn't have to read this for class i would have missed out on it because it is not the kind of art i am immediately drawn to me and art we don't understand each other museums leave me cold and with graphic novels i am always drawn to certain ones and repulsed by others with not one whit of rhyme nor reason nor consistency i am the worst at art-appreciation but i am the queen of making thanksgiving dinner and writing drunken book reviews and white trash fixing of silverware drawers: 
 recognize 
 but yeah a totally charming book i have no personal immigrant experience from which to draw as a way of relating to ths story but it works on any level of ""appreciate thyself and don't wear shoes just because the humans are doing it"" kind of thing 
 where did that wine go i thought it was time i added the sandman it fits precisely into my systematic program of reading ""hold on"" i can hear all you folks out there saying "" your 'systematic program of reading' why you're one of the most eclectic readers i know"" 
 i can understand why you might feel that way but there is a little method to my madness although it is true that some of the books i read (progressive political analyzes slim 20th century verse collections cat books classic spiritual treatises or the occasional literary novel) do not fit within my grand plan most of them do 
 about ten years ago i realized that many books i liked were from emerging belittled or despised forms or genres: the elizabethan popular stage play the budding 18th century novel the gothic romance the victorian bourgeois novel published in serial form the novel of sensation the decadent experiment the adventure tale the sea story the spy story the ghost story the pulps (both mystery and terror) the space opera and other science fiction and fantasy of the '50's the detective novel and the modern horror tale whereas the writers of ""literary fiction"" are often too concerned with critical opinion judiciously curbing their personal obsessions and producing unreadable ""writerly"" prose the humble genre writer is more likely to give his ""inner crazy"" free rein and either tell his eccentric story in no-nonsense fashion or--on occasion--let his plots and prose burgeon untrammeled like a blooming meadow garden at worst the result is amusing or odd; at best it is something original something new 
 not long ago it occurred to me that--being too much a creature of words--i had neglected an obvious example of an emerging genre: the comic book of the late 80's on its way to becoming the ""graphic novel"" since i'm already in love with gaiman's american gods i decided to begin with the sandman 
 i am glad i did the first eight numbers of gaiman's series are on the surface a traditional quest story morpheus lord of the dreamworld imprisoned for years by a sorcerer goes searching for the objects of power--his helmet his jewel his pouch of dream-dust--so that he may once again exercise full power over his realm but the stories it tells and the genres in touches range widely from an edwardian tale of an aleister crowley type sorcerer a pulp ec horror cain and abel anecdote a contemporary british horror story of drug abuse through a mythic descent into hell featuring an epic duel with demons until it climaxes in a ghastly ordeal of modern horror (with a little meta-fiction thrown in) in which an escaped madman in a diner in possession of the dream lord's mind manipulating jewel brutalizes the restaurant's clientele for hours the final number (""the sound of her wings"")--perhaps the most elegant of the eight--is however a kind of whimsical coda introducing us to dream's sister the irreverent and down-to-earth death 
 i thought everything about this saga--story dialogue art--was well executedexcept for one small detail gaiman chooses to make a reference to the dc universe (the justice league of america to be precise) in a way that breaks the spell of what otherwise would be a completely self-contained transcendent and mythic journey but that's the kind of thing that's bound to happen in emerging genres people take risks 
 anyway i'm hooked on to sandman volume 2: ""the doll's house"" let's get this out of the way up front: daytripper may be the best graphic novel i've ever had the pleasure to read consider yourselves warned 
 perhaps daytripper's biggest success is that it saves itself from being cliche all the things that people want to say about it (eg ""the book is life-affirming"" or ""the book shows that death is just another part of life"") are exactly the kinds of things that could be said about that new movie that you don't want to see the one that is bound to be an oasis of sentimental schmaltz in the desert of valuable storytelling daytripper could have been one more lazy expression of what we all want to believe despite ourselves and despite the present evidence pouring incessantly from every media faucet namely: that life is worth it 
 that's what daytripper could have been 
 instead fabio moon and gabriel ba actively work to suppress cliche and to reign in formula at least i imagine that they worked hard at it because they deliver such a completely compelling work that i have to imagine bloodied sweat staining everything in their vicinity save for the gorgeous art daytripper is moving without contrivance or manipulation and that right there is something 
 in trying to pin down the crowning achievement among all daytripper's perfections i find myself struggling there are so many wonderful things about this work that to attempt to elevate one above the others seems juvenile a task for children who aren't really concerned with absorbing the book for what it is so then let's speak broadly 
 as mentioned the art that fills and wraps the book is just wonderful through the pen and the brush (tools i imagine have been used here) the creators craft a world that is wholly believable one that holds as much life as the characters that inhabit it the set designs are so varied and detailed and appropriate that it becomes easy for the reader to just pass by never considering the time and thought that went into planning these breathing environments i would recommend all readers take an hour after finishing the book and just flip through the pages and take in the world of daytripper without the press of narrative or dialogue or exposition or monologue hurrying attention on to what comes next it would be a shame to miss what moon and ba have done here 
 the degree of life invested in these characters and--specifically--into our protagonist is something special when one considers that we are only given ten short chapters with which to acquaint ourselves with those who comprise the world through which bras (our protagonist) explores his own life purpose and meaning well before the final page bras feels like a character fully revealed--as if were the creators to free him from the shackles of the page an attentive reader might be able to predict the course of his life or at least write a believable excursis on one's own it is to moon and ba's credit that i never felt that i had been handed a stereotype or stock character both art and writing conspire to build a portrait of an individual in whom the questions of the world populous might be asked 
 with all the talk of life-breathing characters and art it may be inevitable that some mention be given to the life-affirming nature of the work i am hesitant here only for the fact that i find it may be impossible to in some small paragraph describe the nature of the book's accomplishment without resorting to the cliches that daytripper ably overpowers 
 certainly the book expresses a rounded philosophy that presents life as something both valuable and worth pursuing and argues not according to reason or the comparison of premises but by simply presenting the stories of bras' life daytripper asks a single question relentlessly it demands answer from every moment of life from the big to the small what was this life and how shall it in death be valued 
 bras is occupied as the writer of obituaries and it is through this peculiar vantage that his own story unfolds it is established early on that death is a part of life--perhaps largely so that we might get that out of the way and begin exploring what that precipitates in a meaningful way through the book's constant return to the obituary we are able to gradually piece together a philosophy of living a valuation of lifespans moon and ba present a carefully constructed yet simple meditation on what it means to be us and how life death and society conspire to bring meaning to the purposes we may invent for ourselves 
 bras' answer may not be your answer but respect must be given to his search for and then development of that answer fabio moon and gabriel ba have done the literate society a boon by allowing us to explore these questions alongside bras allowing us to take part in his life while he discovers its directions purpose and passions 
 this is something i do not do but: i recommend that everyone read this 
 [bookclub discussion guide] 
 [review courtesy of good ok bad] a lot of people who came into my family's life looking like heroes ended up acting more like villains i wish i could say the opposite was also true but that was pretty fucking rare 
 see this is why goodreads is so great - i wasn't in love with this volume until i read anne's excellent review where she recontextualized the story into real-world situations that made me appreciate it so much more with her insights and anecdotes that woman's got a gift for reviewing man she should come back and do it more frequently 
 because yeah - this time it isn't all fierce action and adventure this has always been the story of a complicated marriage but it's usually taken the form of ""both of our people want to kill us and the product of our miscegenation and we must flee to the farthest reaches of the galaxy"" and here the problems are more recognizable relationship woes: working late hours trying to make time for each other the jealousy of the working-spouse for the caregiver-spouse's closeness with their child turning to mind-obliterating substances to get through the grind of the day new friends with romantic agendas - and it's all done really well with some excellent subtle detailing but man - at first i was dismayed at how ""ordinary"" the drama was 
 (although i am still such a fan of the damnable foreshadowing this series is so fond of dropping this one was dropped and it set off a chain reaction that made my jaw and stomach drop simultaneously) 
 it's a different vibe from the previous books and there was far too much time spent in robot-ville for me but it's definitely setting the stage for exciting developments to come and it's not all rom com themes there's still zany-fun stuff like this: 
 and this: 
 and if you ever wanted to know what a teevee-headed android's perineum looks like well you're in luck: 
 but the worst thing about this book is this: 
 which is apparently a limited-edition bookplate that was given out at forbidden planet; a comic book store located like right there i wish i'd been reading this series when this was going around because i would have grabbed it like cake you snooze you lose karen 
 i will leave you with this excellent observation: 
 and seriously - read anne's review i mean unless you haven't read the book first and then - go read the book silly 
 thanks for letting me read this maggie it was still warm from your tummy 
 ******************************************** 
 maggie's trying to help me out in my resolve to not burn through this entire series in a matter of days 
 ""if you can't get to it you can't read it"" 
 can't argue with that 
 eventually she moved 
 review to come when i read this today i experienced a strange sort of excitement combined with dread 
 i thought to myself ""yay another warren ellis book"" then almost immediately i thought ""i shouldn't even pick it up though i'm tired of getting volume 1 of a story from him then never seeing anything else"" 
 and yes i'm aware of the irony but to be fair i only have one unfinished series ellis has teased my heart with fell desolation jones doctor sleepless injection captain swing ignition city 
 but of course i picked it up anyway because i love everything this man writes and i'd rather have my heart broken by him than get 20 volumes of half-baked schlock from someone else 
 and i read it and it's good though it broke my heart a little because it introduced about 20 new characters and settings which means if the series isn't continued it's just going to bug my ocd even more 
 but coming on here to review it i was pleasantly surprised to see that there is a second volume out 
 so yeah this one is doubly worth your time and there's more to come i love how twisted this was i'm also so curious to see how there are still 5 (technically 10 if i weren't reading the black editions) volumes left things are already so crazy i can't wait to see what happens next this was great i'm definitely going to pick up the next volume soon because damn that ending 
 also a+++ for all of the diversity in this comic series love very much enjoyed it good clear compelling storytelling it's obvious to see why the author is an eisner award winner 
 it has a nice modern teenage storyline but the paralell 1800's teen storyline really makes it into sometime amazing the dollop of the fantastic in there (or magical realism if you insist on the term) sealed the deal for me bumping it up from a great story to a truly excellent one 
 my only regret is that i don't think i can give this one to my little boy *quite* yet he's 75 now and while he could read and understand it some of the relationship and betrayal stuff i don't know if he's quite into that yet 
 that's not a failing of the book though quite the opposite any book i *wish* i could share with my boy is doing something very right every time raina telgemeier releases a new graphic novel i get super excited her stories are so heartfelt and honest 
 ''ghosts'' however is a little different from her previous works for starters it isn't as realistic which i think is its main weakness it definitely is the reason why i couldn't give it a 5-star-rating 
 i loved the culture in it especially the dia de los muertos (day of the dead) which i've always found quite interesting and spectacularly unique it's definitely the author's most diverse book to date 
 however much i enjoyed the dia de los muertos elements and scenes though i found that the addition of actual ghosts who interact with people took away from the realisticity of the story 
 but it's pretty charming and moving nonetheless cat's sister maya has cystic fibrosis which is why they had to move to bahia de la luna where fog is ever-present in the air the right place to find ghosts if one wishes to 
 cat and maya's relationship is extremely heart-warming and honest they truly care for one another and not only because they both know they're not going to be sisters for ever plus maya although she is very sick keeps her smiles on at all times; i found her to be tremendously brave 
 the themes explored make this a memorable graphic novel i think anyone looking for an original and atmospheric story should read and it's so masterfully illustrated you'll want to keep it for ever i sure as hell will treasure this copy 
 blog | youtube | twitter | instagram | google+ | bloglovin' 45/5 stars 
 things are getting insane and i love it i have no clue where this story is going to go and i can't wait to see where it takes me :) 45/5 
 i saw the movie adaptation a couple of years ago and ever since then i've wanted to start the graphic novels i'm so happy that i finally did because this definitely didn't disappoint i liked it even more than the movie because the art is used in such a clever way so different than any other graphic novel i've read before (i've only read maus and fun home but those were for school) the humor was great as well and i already ordered the next volume so i can read it soon a masterpiece of graphic novels 
 this edition as the name indicates collects the complete run of ""persepolis""

 i remember the days when we traveled around europe it was enough to carry an iranian passport they rolled out the red carpet we were rich before now as soon as they learn our nationality they go through everything as though we were all terrorists they treat us as though we have the plague 
 persepolis is the masterpiece by marjane satrapi a pseudo-biographical work illustrating her life since 10 years old (1980) until 24 years old (1994) where she experienced her coming-to-life in her native iran during the islamic revolution and the war with iraq along with four years in europe and her return to iran again 
 in this graphic novel you will witness many of the convoluted events happening during the decade of the 80s in the middle east from the point of view of a brave girl that was living at the heart of the incidents 
 marjane is able to present each topic that she wants to expose in titled parts where you learn about relevant facts of iranian's society its past its present and its future 
 however what makes unique persepolis is the brilliant approach by marjane satrapi of those events since while she is fearless to show the brutal side she is also honest in showing her failures and doubts during growing up and even she goes to the funny side of life 
 since it's impossible for any human being to live in constant stressed status people need to breath to liberate the weight of their risky existence in many different ways 
 people needs to smile not matter where they live they need to live 
 and marjane knows that 
 therefore she masterfully is able to tell her lifestory full of political episodes and social chapters but always adding humoristic elements with taste and without ridiculing the seriousness and gravity of the situations 
 anybody can tell a tragedy but 
 a dramedy requires talent tact and wit 
 brace yourself and meet persepolis ""all it takes is one bad day to reduce the sanest man alive to lunacy that's how far the world is from where i am just one bad day"" 
 now this was good and i mean good it's such a simple idea but so real and powerful i mean one bad day is all it takes one push one snap one descent into chaos and it's over once you've crossed that threshold then things will never be the same again and the joker being the sly and brilliant villain that he is wants to share the experience with the world he wants to show humanity that they are not that far from him the first man he wants to reduce is the stalwart commissioner gordon but i think we all know who is intended victim actually is 
 the joker was once normal he had a girlfriend; he had a job but the world shitted on him somewhat chronic and like many people he was forced to turn to crime; he was forced to break society's rules in order to survive that's where it all began that first step into the darkness led to many other steps down the road of corruption it wasn't long before petty crime turned to murder and butchery the joker became ruined and lost himself in his nasty deeds this is a great origin story one that fully lives up to the character immense personality allan more totally nails it 
 ""there is no sanity clause 
 so when you find yourself locked onto an unpleasant train of thought heading for the places in your past where the screaming is unbearable remember there's always madness 
 madness is the emergency exit 
 you can just step outside and close the door on all those dreadful things that happened you can lock them away 
 forever"" 
 and the ending it's all about the ending the joker's personality is infectious at least he wants it to be he's always tried to bring down the good he ruined harvey dent and he has always wanted to ruin the bat and he just may have the end is suggestive of two things: firstly batman strangling the joker in one final heroic act there's some irony in that sentence; secondly batman descending to the jokers level and embracing the insanity of one bad day 
 i'll leave you with this picture and see if you can decide: the white snake 
 i have never said this before and it goes against all my readers' advisory training but anyone who gives this book fewer than 5 stars is just flat-out wrong 
 it is an absolutely stunning book 
 foundling 
 apparently not only can shaun tan draw and paint real good but he is equally skilled at three-dimensional art and here he has created 75 sculptures ranging in size from 2 1/4 - 16 inches illustrating various grimm's tales reminding us how very dark they were in their original undisneyfied form and also how very few of them we actually know 
 the moon 
 i mean seriously - he just sat down one day and made this: 
 the little shroud 
 in addition tan also photographed and digitally edited all the pieces appearing in the book himself which is just showing off at that point 
 the boy who left home to find out about fear 
 the sculptures are perfect - haunting evocative textured suggestive occasionally unfinished or raggedy-looking but they all embody a tone or mood so perfectly compatible with the dark weirdness of the tales 
 fitcher's bird 
 the detail in some of these is remarkable 
 the old man and his grandson 
 simelei mountain 
 excerpts taken from this specific edition of the tales: the complete fairy tales of the brothers grimm accompany each sculpture on the recto and the book supplies a summary of each tale in its backmatter so you can see what you've been missing i know i am not the only person who after reading this is determined to familiarize myself with some of the more obscure grimm tales if anyone has suggestions for the best collection i'm all ears otherwise i'm just gonna buy this pretty one: 
 from neil gaiman's introduction: 
 there is a tactile quality to the shaun tan sculptures they feel primal as if they were made in a long-ago age of the world when the stories were first being shaped and that perhaps the sculptures came first 
 and 
 shaun tan makes me want to hold these tales close to rub them with my fingers to feel the cracks and the creases and the edges of them he makes me want to pick them up inspect them from unusual angles feel the heft and the weight of them he makes me wonder what damage i could do with them how badly i could hurt someone if i hit them with a story 
 these pictures make me want to put the stories in my mouth knowing that i will eventually have to spit them out again reluctantly in words 
 the fox and the cat 
 all of these things are true for me too and additionally i want to find a picture that shows all of the sculptures at once on a bunch of shelves or something just to appreciate the scope of his accomplishment but internet has not provided this visual for me yet the closest i could find is this: 
 which is more frustrating than anything 
 all these review-pictures were taken by me from the book with my little camera and are much more impressive and detailed in the actual book with its tricky-to-photograph glossy paper (or in any professional-type photos that can easily be found online use your googler) 
 here's one for those of you who don't google well: 
 there's also a cool step-by-step description of process here 
 just one-hundred percent impressive in every way this book is a treasure 
 the riddle 
 shaun tan you are great at all things 
 and if you are ever moving home and cannot fit all these sculptures in your cardboard boxes i will take them off your hands i've been hearing about this comic for a long while and now that i finally got a copy and read it i can see what all the fuss is about 
 so yeah i want all of this all the time can we somehow make this happen if i were judging this book solely on its artwork it would be an easy five stars there are five main stories plus an introduction and a conclusion each with their own style of illustration it's not that i love them all equally but i do generally appreciate range and variety : 
 in a way it kind of reminded me of fear(s) of the dark a film in which several different illustrators bring their own brand of creepy to life through unique animation stylings: 
 this book is obviously more limited in its range because it is all coming from a single imagination but as far as artwork goes i dig it 
 however the stories were mostly just okay 
 they are definitely not scary or weren't to me anyway and they fall more on the side of ""atmospheric"" or ""ominous"" than ""you will never sleep again"" 
 which considering this is meant as a ya book is probably for the best but i'm still looking for my big scare and i fear it will never come 
 which is totally the wrong kind of fear 
 an introduction 
 this is just a little tease not so much a story as a setting of the mood for what is to come 
 our neighbor's house 
 this one feels very familiar there's an olde timey new england vibe to it and while i don't think it's actually based on anything it feels like a mashup of a bunch of different stories like something that would be read aloud in a spoooooky voice during a haunted hayride right before costumed people come running out of the woods all clawing and moaning to the delighted shrieks of girl scouts makes me want to drink warm cider 
 a lady's hands are cold 
 this had probably my favorite artwork of the bunch 
 and i enjoyed the way it exploded offa the page 
 and it's also in the running for top story (along with our neighbor's house) this one reads more like a fairy tale than the others; a little hint of bluebeard but with fewer wives more property damage and much less gratitude 
 his face all red 
 i'm honestly not sure what happened in this one maybe i'm missing some subtlety but near as i can figure this is the story arc: 
 -spooky tease/declaration 
 -backtrack 
 -story story story 
 -action 
 -repercussions of action 
 -spooky happenings 
 -investigation 
 -confirmation that previous action occurred 
 -the end 
 i don't understand this at all there's an expectation of some kind of twist or reveal but instead the ending is like someone going through the house on their way to bed: yup door's locked stove's off cat has water everything is where i thought it was 
 what am i missing 
 my friend janna 
 this has the bones of a very traditional ghost story but there's just too much story around what could have been a genuinely spooky read if it didn't meander so much i think horror works best when it is streamlined when there's ambiguity left over for the reader to fill in with their own worst imaginings and also when the journey is straight and fast and decisive like a gunshot or a thunderclap this one is so frontloaded with unfocused exposition at the beginning that you get lulled into what is ultimately a very gentle horror i think the illustrations work particularly well in conjunction with this story but i also think it would have been much more effective if it were whittled down a bit 
 the nesting place 
 another one - no idea really what's going on here i mean i understand the basic plot but it's the details that leave me head-scratching the prologue seems to suggest that the  situation is location-specific but that's clearly not the case nor is it familial although it tangentially affects a family over generations and i know what i just said about ambiguity being good for horror but how does that ending work is it both or migrated and aren't they going to the very same city that was effective as a threat and avoided on the previous page i don't understaaaaaand 
 in conclusion 
 this is another little shorty - the urban legend rim shot to end end the collection on a pop it's a little red riding hood offshoot whose zinger is pretty much the same shape as this joke that i am spoiler tagging for people who don't think pedophile jokes are ever funny: 
 a pedophile walks through the woods with a child the child says ""these woods are scary"" the pedophile says ""tell me about it i have to walk back through here alone"" 
 different punch line but the same basic ""gotcha"" energy 
 i'm giving it a four because i did like the artwork but the stories themselves are pretty patchy so i'm being a bit generous here 
 dear books - please be scarier for me ** spoiler alert ** 
 i was surprised by two things 1 george r r martin can finish a story without killing the protagonist and 2 george r r martin can finish a story this book falls in to the difficult category of ""well-executed but i have no idea how to give it a star rating or if i ever want to read it again or recommend it to anyone"" 
 that said it *was* very well executed and i suppose that's the heart of the matter 
 so yeah five stars if you want a sweet well-rounded story that distantly circles the fact that the main character 
 *spoilers by the way* 
 is a five year old boy who doesn't realize that his mother isn't on a business trip that's she's dead first the reader then the character comes to realize that 
 so yeah if that's what you're looking for in a graphic novel then this one's for you but honestly i don't know what the target audience is for this i'd never give it to my kids 
 maybe it's for the same group of people that like to read those chicken soup for the soul books and cry all day 
 so yeah lot of good stuff here but the core concept isn't really one that i'm looking for more of in my life i cry too much these days anyway i don't need any help 
 ps it also outs santa claus so even if you want your kids to read a book about parent-death you might want to re-consider there if you want to keep that particular piece of myth alive 
 ^^ sorry spoilers about santa to see the full review please visit https://readrantrockandrollcom/2017/ 
 iaeur(tm)ve been pondering about what to say about this book for days it took me awhile to see how i felt about the book and i ended up reading it twice i could feel myself frowning the entire way all the way to the end 
 there are two different storylines parallel to each other the prose is the story of mary in 1982 while the haunting interlaced black and white illustrations are ellaaeur(tm)s story in the present 
 mary is an orphan living at thornhill in 1982 and is waiting to be adopted sheaeur(tm)s one of the only girls left along with a very mean girl who enjoys tormenting and bullying mary to the point that mary remains locked in her room most days 
 she dreads even coming out to eat and spends all of her time in her room making dolls or reading the secret garden maryaeur(tm)s story is told from her diary pages i found it emotional and really couldnaeur(tm)t understand why something wasnaeur(tm)t being done to control the behavior of these girls who were treating her wrongly and bullying her there are spoilers/hints along the way which gives you an idea about the end i thought that was almost too much 
 ellaaeur(tm)s story is quite different told in the present sheaeur(tm)s moved into a house right next door to thornhill and deals with her own set of problems her mother is absent for whatever reason and her father is busy with work-related engagements so ella is left alone most of the time thornhill is viewed from right outside her window and she becomes curious when she sees a girl in the garden there even though thornhill has been shut down since 1982 itaeur(tm)s abandoned but ella is curious and begins to wonder about the girl she sees from time to time she begins exploring the garden because what else is there for her do 
 this is a fairly large book at about 540 pages but many of the pages are illustrations which make it a fairly quick read i found the illustrations paired with maryaeur(tm)s diary haunting and i didnaeur(tm)t want to put it down until i could find out what was going to happen with these two girls i found the book unique chilling and atmospheric but honestly i wasnaeur(tm)t happy with parts of it especially the unexplained abrupt ending overall itaeur(tm)s good and even though itaeur(tm)s juvenile fiction it kept me engaged until the end 
 my rating is 45**** i freaking loved this graphic novel the art work is amaze balls i loved the story line lady mechanika is trying to find out what happened to make her what she is today she's also fights the good fight for any evil out there this is steampunk awesomeness =) 
 i will leave a few pictures so you can see what i'm talking about two of them i took myself from my book and you can tell lol enjoy 
 fin two hours of my life that i will never get back 
 this is the graphic novel edition of ""ghost world"" by fantagraphics books originally published as chapters in the comic book series ""eightball"" #11-18 
 creative team: 
 writer & illustrator: daniel clowes 
 much ado about nothing 
 people who read my reviews know that i'm not usually negative (for not saying of giving 1-star ratings) when i am commenting about my readings and being that negative doesn't cause me any joy sadly when i do feel that it's necessary well i don't hesitate about it even if it's against a generally popular and praised work 
 no book is a $100 bill to be liked by anybody 
 i didn't have a clue about what was about ghost world and after reading it 
 i still don't have a clue about what was about it 
 the main characters of ghost world are enid coleslaw (her dad legally changed his last name from cohn) and rebecca (becky) doppelmeyer both 18-years old girls both just graduated from high school best friends and still looking out for what to do with the rest of their lives 
 the graphic novel doesn't show any north no real storyline just a bunch of unrelated episodes without any clear purpose where enid and becky basically interact with old acquaintances or new people always commenting something negative about them 
 much negative about everything 
 both enid and becky are very mean to everybody they are constantly pointing out their faults calling them with offensive names and generally criticizing them behind their backs and/or in their faces enid and becky also have negative opinions about almost anything around them even enid and becky comment in negative light about themselves 
 in a few cases some of the support characters deserve the negative critique but in most cases enid and becky are just mean without any provocation or justification 
 so i guess that since enid and becky are sooooooo negative about everybody and everything i don't feel so bad myself for being that negative in my review about the graphic novel 
 i have read (and watch) a lot of black comedy products and i have laughed plenty with them but while ghost world tries to be humorous honestly i didn't feel the impulse to laugh with it not in the least 
 much lost about potential 
 it's a shame (at least in my very personal opinion) that ghost world didn't exploit its own storytelling potential since the characters and ambiance were ideal to build a plot in the style of other products like the live-action film amelie or the animated tv series daria 
 curiously enough ghost world ""born"" in 1993 and lasted until 1997; daria began in 1997 and amelie is from 2001 so one could think that maybe just maybe ghost world could serve as an inspiration and/or to open the road for those projects but i don't know for sure about that and after all ghost world is a very pale image in comparison with those mentioned wonderful masterpieces 
 much movie about graphic novel 
 i knew that there is a film adaptation of ghost world but i haven't been able to watch it (yet) after reading this graphic novel i wanted to check (reading it at imdb) the premise in the movie since i wasn't able to understand how somebody would be able to pull a movie out of this 
 i wasn't surprised when i noticed that the movie had key changes in its core plot since the graphic novel doesn't have any plot at all 
 so it's understandable that the film is different in its basics to be able to present a proper storyline to follow 
 and i heard that the movie is far far faaar better product than the original graphic novel happy birthday greg 
 this is a stunning book of sequential art in which the only words are the epigraph and a quote from emerson at the end 
 i was a little concerned with the epigraph initially because it's one of those goopy new age-y sounding statements full of abstractions but signifying nothing: 
 in the animal kingdom animals neither love nor hate each other 
 love and hate are parts of a natural whole a supreme balance many consider to be universal or even divine an elemental love 
 a love that mankind could never experience 
 i'm not really sure how that's supposed to apply to this story unless that's simply the mission statement for the series as a whole in any event it made me very glad that there are no words to the actual story because the artwork speaks for itself loudly clearly 
 ""mankind"" doesn't come into play at all - this isn't one of those ""man is bad and nature suffers"" messages here everything that happens is completely within the natural world there are orcas elephant seals musk oxen rabbits polar bears etc and animals fight each other hunt their prey save their young live and die while a volcano erupts sending burning lava and avalanches throughout their habitats 
 the animals neither speak nor grieve - there are some close calls but also many animals who get crushed burned eaten there are no songs none of the animals make dresses or play the banjo 
 it's ragged brutal survival and the artwork is phenomenal 
 you can almost hear the bears roar 
 swat 
 bearfight 
 it's absolutely magnificent - beautiful and badass and realistic i have already ordered the first book in this series; the tiger and i await the third le lion; being made available in my country 
 and obviously i will be buying this one in hard copy asap 
 ***************************************************** 
 oh my god the artwork 
 so beautiful so badass 
 full review tk but just a heads-up that it's on netgalley right now - 
 https://s2netgalleycom/catalog/book whoa lots of stuff i just watched the first few episodes of the anime recently and this volume had so much action all packed into it (around 6 or 7 episodes' worth) 
 i think i'm going to take my time reading these as i really enjoy being surprised by the show the art style was a bit distracting at times but i really enjoyed this eh this was an okay graphic novel i was hoping for a bit more of an understandable plot i read outlander and this graphic novel sometimes got me confused especially at the beginning also where was jamies curly hair also claire's breasts kept on getting bigger and bigger - ""the mysterious case of the growing breasts"" (sounds like a rated pg-13 nancy drew novel lol) 
 this didn't really convey the exact plot line of outlander which is understandable but it seemed quite off a points although i did enjoy reading from jamie's pov along with others 
 also why is it only 1/2 the book interesting 
 i give this a 35/5 stars 
 i love outlander so this was definitely a different depiction of it but fun to read nonetheless congratulations semifinalist in goodreads' best graphic novels & comics category 2016 
 three stars with room to grow 
 while impatiently waiting for more installments of saga to come out i decided to check out this other brian k vaughan book because i liked the cover the synopsis promised me plucky girls 80's references and this right here is how you get my attention: 
 suburban drama and supernatural mysteries collide in this smash-hit series about nostalgia first jobs and the last days of childhood 
 all my sweet spots = accounted for 
 because yes - plucky girls: 
 80's references: 
 nostalgia (for me anyway - this picture made my heart soften): 
 and there are also some pretty funny 80's-flavored dream sequences: 
 i'm just not hooked yet it's no saga that's for sure but in a more positive light it's actually what i thought lumberjanes vol 1: beware the kitten holy was going to be before realizing that series was for a much younger reading age this one has all the girl-power and female bonding and general badassery-adventure setup as lumberjanes but with significantly more guns cussin' and good-natured pal-ribbin' pterodactyls and actual danger and it is far less pc because it was the 80's my friends and twelve-year-old internetless kids from the suburbs didn't always have access to the rich spectrum of life and they sometimes said ""faggot"" but if time travelers can forgive a kid for their squeamishness: 
 so can we and for being set in midwestern 80's suburbia there's some decent diversity in the characters here - there's a jewish girl and a vietnamese() girl and an adopted girl of indeterminate race and everyone's favorite stereotype: a chain-smoking irish-american lass tough and redheaded and on her way to becoming a criminal just like the rest of her family but apart from her homophobia and the cliche of her she's pretty rad - willing to step up and throw down for her equally-fierce pack of paper girls against the most unexpected foes 
 i didn't always understand what was going on but i'm confident it will all become clearer in future volumes i'm intrigued enough to continue with the series - i'm not in love with it but it's got potential and i'll check back in next volume to see if it's getting there yet if only to enjoy more 80's background details this book started out so deep and sad i was not even 20 pages in and i had already tears in my eyes 
 going into this i was hesitant for reasons i don't even recall but blankets really hit home for me 
 it's an emotional story following the lives of two brothers from childhood to adulthood i was so into the story that i barely noticed the hours going by and i managed to finish it in one sitting the storyline goes through different times without ever seeming abrupt it had the perfect flow and i'm getting really emotional just thinking about everything that happened 
 i enjoyed the family parts of this story more than the relationship bits so when craig started to describe his girlfriend raina (a little to much for my likes) i started to lose my enthusiasm bit by bit but it returned whenever the family showed up especially when the brothers were together it broke my heart when i saw how distant they got with time the parts from their childhood together were one of my favorites in this story 
 it was a lonely lovely and comforting read that will definitely stay with me for a long time 
 *note: i'm an amazon affiliate if you're interested in buying blankets just click on the image below to go through my link i'll make a small commission* 
 this review and more can be found on my blog dammit i love this premise so much 
 can you please do more of it warren please pretty please i am a fan of the spirit and the messaging and the energy of this book but i'm not personally crazy about either the artwork or the story 
 when this book first started making the rounds here on goodreads for some reason i didn't clock that it was ya i saw that people were adding it to their ya shelves but i've come to terms with the fact that as long as there's a teenage character in a book people are gonna shelve it as ya on goodreads regardless of whether it's intended for teen readers or even appropriate for them 
 so when i finally decided to board this lumberjane-bandwagon and found it officially categorized in the teen section of the bookstore it threw me for a loop for a second but then i was all ""i am glad i am now so broad-minded in the scope of my reading that i am not unwilling to read a book for a teen audience"" 
 and yet 
 it just read so young to me young enough that you could probably get away with marketing this to a middle grade audience without any comprehension/content concerns and having already adjusted (not lowered mind you but adjusted) my expectations to teen mode i found myself requiring additional mental adjustments to try to fit in with the enthusiastic fans - to be the thoughtful reader this book deserved 
 maybe i'm just accustomed to the way teens in the ya novels i read sound like they're twenty-five and maybe this is a more accurate representation of how teens really speak and behave but it still felt really childish and i don't think me-as-teen would have liked it i think i would have felt talked-down to the way religious material directed at teens misses that target of age-appropriateness by presenting unilaterally shiny and morally flawless characters who are perky and great at everything and willing to pitch in and fight fire and succor the needy perfect and unstoppable like a fifties housewife on benzos without naturally the benzos 
 as a female-person it's hard not to want to love a book that's so oohrah girl power and full of smart math-loving girlnerds who say things like 
 and that's emphasizing confidence and empowerment and athleticism and building strong female friendships but it's just so excessively ""holy role model batman"" that it becomes off-putting 
 it's a little too much of that tone that irked me in boy meets boy where everything's acceptable and girls can do anything and conflicts are easily resolved in this hunky dory goody goody role modelly wonderland 
 there's no tension here and you know what happens when things are too relentlessly positive right 
 when other perfectly normal emotions go unacknowledged 
 it's not at all bad i guess i'm just too much of an old shriveled husk of cynical coal to not be filled with double-rainbow x chromosomes in response to this i'm perplexed i don't know how old these characters are meant to be i don't understand how the magic works or what the blend of reality and fantasy is meant to serve i don't know why everyone's going crazy for it 
 and that makes me feel lonesome 
 things i did like - 
 fox tummies: 
 every part that had to do with discovery channel-inspired phobias of blood-sucking catfish river monsters murder rivers etc 
 the fact that the pungeon master badge looks deeply ashamed and disappointed in itself as it should 
 titillating subtext 
 and pretty much every loud adorable thing ripley says 
 ripley reminds me of a special girl i knew in the wayback - someone i was very close to and who rubbed off on me a bit so i guess ripley also reminds me of me which makes me like her even more 
 here is a celebration of ripley 
 whose ""hungry"" posture is the same as her ""i have to pee"" posture 
 who is a marine biology enthusiast 
 who likes kittens 
 and also puppies 
 who is willing to fight a rude bird for some chocolate 
 and this especially made me misty thinking about my old galpal who was so refreshingly free from social niceties that when someone pissed her off she'd just pee in their car at a party or something 
 my wonderful little beastgirl 
 i'll probably keep reading because sisterhood but i'm not fangirling it yet 
 ******************************************* 
 35 stars for the reader-who-is-me but i definitely love and respect it more-stars as an objective overseer acknowledging its important contribution to the bookworld this is so so so so good it doesn't try to be disgusting and it doesn't mainly focus on the zombies surprisingly it's more about the little community of survivors and their relationships their helping each other out their trying to find a way out of this pit of death i felt desolate to see some characters gone too soon or left behind but i have some hope of seeing new ones in the future that will make me stop missing the departed ones 
 great great comic series my girlfriend picked this up for my son who has recently turned 7 
 he's a big reader and he loves comics though he hasn't been tested is probably reading years ahead of whatever the standard metric is 
 unfortunately sarah made one of the classic mistakes here and judged a book by its cover in fact she made the mistake twice 
 1 she assumed that because it was a comic it was probably for kids 
 2 she assumed that a book with animal characters is for kids 
 this is a mistake that someone who has better comic literacy never would have made if for not other reason than because they'd read maus at some point in their lives 
 so on one hand it wasn't a good choice because it was too much for my little boy (he read it just fine but it was too violent for him and i think the plot of treachery and betrayal was really beyond what he could understand) 
 but that doesn't mean it isn't a good book it is the art is great and the comic paneling is excellent in a way that i couldn't have understood 5 years ago before i'd read several thousand comics 
 so while it didn't strike home with my boy it struck home with me the story is strong and the storytelling and art are truly beyond the pale 
 what's more the story was legitimately heroic in ways that i've rarely experienced the lion's share of the credit for this should go to the art and storytelling but the fact that the story centers around mice is important too the smaller you are the more bravery means and you can't get much smaller than a mouse 
 so yeah i wouldn't recommend it for kids under 10 or so but if you're older than that it's well-worth your time 
 especially recommended for those of us who always loved reepicheep but wanted a whole book about him being a stone-cold badass there were no words in this graphic novel no dialogs no written sentences no words 
 but as i realized throughout my read they weren't needed the mesmerizing art was enough 
 and what illustrations never have i read such a graphic novel before 
 it was a fast-read i don't think i've even spend thirty minutes to get through it the story was poignant and i loved how realistically it portrayed immigrants and how metaphorically and fantastically the author drew the world-building and settings 
 it didn't actually speak to me to an obvious point as i maybe predicted since even though i am an emigrant too (romania -> canada) i was very young at that time and we had someone to help us unlike the main character who had to find help and shelter by himself still i can perfectly understand the main character's - untold - feelings and relate in a way to him i was just probably more excited than he was and not as confused/lost 
 aside for the graphics and settings what i loved most was the fact that not only we could see the main character's experience at traveling and changing completely of surrounding but also the people that he meets in his way and that give him some support it was breathtakingly captivating 
 i do have a complaint though: it was like i said too short too fast-paced it could have been longer i believe because every scene lasted less than two minutes or so that did give some unrealism to the story - not including the settings which i like to consider well-fitting everything it would also have been interesting to get to know his wife and child better with some more scenes including them and maybe a little more to why he decided to leave his country the blurb does implicitly or explicitly tell us why depending on your point of view but actually seeing it would have given some even more intensity to the story and a solid background although i do understand that this is mainly about adaptation experiences and going forward 
 absolutely recommended not only will it appear spectacular and surprising to lovers of graphic novels or not but it is also short and easy to get into the story ""buildings burn people die but real love is forever"" 
 the crow is a story of love hate violence honor greed revenge and ultimately redemption 
 the world of james o'barr is beautiful despite its darkness 
 there's a very fine line between being a hero and a villian that's the reason i love eric draven so much eric is the perfect example of an antihero he is a good guy forced to do bad things in order to avenge his beloved fianca(c)e he is a complex character you can't help but root for because his rage is justifiable i needed something to take my mind off of the fact that i just finished watching all 9 seasons of the office and paper girls did just that 
 it's a compelling storyline with amazing artwork that had me right from the beginning 
 i was however confused a few times because the storyline moved a little too fast 
 and i wanted more of a backstory to the characters mainly on mackenzie ""mac"" and her group 
 this graphic novel jumps right into the main plot line; monster demons invading earth on halloween which was interesting to read about but after a while i just wanted to get to know the 4 main girls 
 and i'm definitely interested in checking out the next volume because the very last page was incredible 
 35 stars

 this review and more can be found on my blog i run a hand over the sandpaper skin i've read about survivors find themselves grazed from it when the shark glides by 
 everything is teeth 
 this is a family memoir in graphic novel form by evie wyld focusing on her childhood trips to visit relatives in australia and her lifelong fascination with sharks; their role in both her actual experiences and in the realm of her imagination 
 the writing is beautiful: 
 it's not the images that come first when i think of the parts of my childhood spent in australia 
 or even the people it's the sounds 
 - the butcher birds and the magpies that lived amongst us on the back veranda 
 and stronger still the smells - 
 eucalyptus watermelon and filter mud 
 rich and rude and sickly strong 
 most of all the river muddy and lined with mangrove 
 salt and sulphur; 
 at low tide the black mud that smelled bad 
 that had stingray burrows hollowed out in it 
 the smell i associate with the smell of sharks 
 the artwork is also stunning - a combination of cartoon and hyper-realistic pencil drawings which are perfect complements to the text 
 even the endpapers are fantastic: 
 the story itself is fairly quiet this isn't a bleak memoir about childhood trauma or life-changing circumstances; it's more like a series of snapshots of small memories - some good some bad muted by life-distance and riddled with sharks 
 sharks are everywhere in this book and they represent both an alluring magnetism and an embodiment of her fears she is enthralled by the stories her australian family fishermen by trade recount about attacks and near-misses but she also imagines her parents and brother being eaten by sharks if i think the worst then the worst is unlikely to happen 
 sharks are also fun at parties 
 her first childhood crush is on shark attack survivor rodney fox whose story and photographs she discovers in a book about sharks in what has to be one of the most romantic and erotic passages ever involving a love-interest's exposed insides: 
 rodney fox i fall for you at six years old 
 i see right inside your viscera and you tell me about surviving i read about how your abdomen was opened 
 and all your ribs broken your diaphragm punctured 
 lung ripped open shoulder blade pierced 
 spleen uncovered 
 the main artery from your heart exposed 
 the tendons in your hand all cut 
 and how the shark left behind a tooth 
 still stuck in your wrist 
 i see the before photograph impossible red 
 sausages stuffed into an empty carcass 
 the white skin tender swollen and peeling away 
 and i see the after photograph the horsehair 
 stitches that make a perfect semi-circle from 
 shoulder to ribs - a cartoon apple bite 
 and your face: salty eyes 
 strong bone in your nose 
 an expression that said 
 the whole thing was just fine 
 stuck in the mouth wrestling your thumbs into its eyes till it lets go 
 and you feel yourself loose in your skin suit 
 the shark is gone and people are nudging your guts back inside 
 and when you wake again it hasn't changed your face 
 it is all fine 
 i solemnly understand you to be the greatest living man 
 later visiting a shark museum she recognizes him just by a photo of his spleen which is the truest test of devotion and intimacy 
 she also while watching jaws finds other men who appeal to her: i like the moustache on quint and the beard on hooper 
 when she's home in england she regales her school-bullied brother with stories of sharks to distract him from his sadness and has fantasies of shark attacks where no shark attack outside of a syfy movie could be 
 incidentally - this image is actually from ghost shark one of the best syfy shark movies 
 sharks stand in for that nameless dread permeating childhood - for all of the situations you don't understand for the feeling that something bad could happen at any moment sharks are the boogeyman embodying all of life's anxieties lurking in the most unexpected places 
 but they aren't just manifestations of her fears they also inspire awe and respect as the majestic but misunderstood creatures they are when she is taken to ""vic hislop's killer shark show"" by her father featuring the attraction of ""conan the record breaking white pointer"" she is excited wanting to be there for feeding time imagining: 
 great hunks of raw meat 
 bellowing gops of blood against the bone-white teeth 
 but it turns out to be a cheap and sordid spectacle featuring sacking-cloth sharks a video in which vic hislop himself characterizes sharks as ""killing machines with a taste for human flesh"" posing triumphantly with the corpses of sharks cutting them open to reveal their insides and a photo of rodney fox's spleen ""but there are no after photographs with your smiling face"" which reduces him to a victim instead of a survivor worst of all is conan for whom there will be no more gops of blood instead his seventeen-foot corpse is suspended in a tank of nauseatingly dirty water undignified skin flaking away 
 and while many of the images of sharks are sad - hauled out of the water and killed by her relatives cut open to reveal their young (taking ""two puppies back home for frying"") 
 or definned and rolled unceremoniously wastefully back into the water or left to thrash and wear herself out and die it's never preachy just memories of things that happened 
 it's a spectacular book in both words and images and i loved loved loved it 
 one more reminder for me to never go to australia: 45 
 very very very powerful and i like that you see the relationship between spiegelman and his father throughout"
2,fantasy," back when i was first published, people made a lot of comparisons between me and scott lynch. 
 the sentiment was mostly along the lines of ""pat rothfuss is the next scott lynch!"" 
 here's the thing, lies of lock lamora had come out almost exactly a year before my first book, the name of the wind. it was scott's first book, the first in a fantasy series. the world was gritty and real, and it had knocked everyone over with how good it was. 
 so i knew it was a flattering comparison, but at the time, i was kinda irked by it. i remember thinking, ""why do i have to be the next scott lynch? why can't i just be the first pat rothfuss? i'll probably be a lot better at that, i've got way more experience at it if nothing else...."" 
 years later i finally got around to reading lies and enjoyed it. i saw that it was a clever book, and gritty, with a cool world. and there was an orphan boy in it who was a witty, mouthy thief. a while after that, i met scott and really liked him as well. so i let go of what little residual irritation i had, not that there was very much... 
 fast forward to now. this last week i started re-reading lies, and i was absolutely fucking *stunned* by how good it is. the construction of it. the language. the world. the cleverness. the wit. 
 there is nothing i don't like in this book. seriously. okay. fine. one tiny *tiny* quibble. 
 even so, do you know how rare it is for me to say that? right now, in the full flush of this second reading, i think lies is probably in e in my top ten favorite books ever. maybe my top five. 
 it's not really fair to compare the two books. they're different styles. different subjects. different worlds. 
 that said, here's the things that the lies of locke lamora does better than the name of the wind. 
 1. the beginning of his book is stronger than mine. 
 seriously. 50 pages into my book, you'll have reached the point where someone is starting to actually tell a story. 
 50 pages into lies, you know the main character and are halfway into a fucking heist. 
 2. his title is better than mine. 
 don't get me wrong. the name of the wind is a good title, it's the *right* title for my book. but ""the lies of lock lamora"" that's a faboo title right there. 
 and his series title is better than mine too. ""gentleman bastard"" beats ""kingkiller chronicles"" hands-down. 
 3. his cussing is better than mine. 
 not in real life. in real life i cuss like a sailor. but the language in my books is pretty genteel and tame. 
 in lies, lynch's low-life street thugs are vulgarian virtuosos. this might seem like a little thing, but it's not. it builds the world. it shows character. it helps make the story feel truly, perfectly grubby and real. 
 here it is in a nutshell: when i was first published, i was irritated when people compared me to scott lynch. only now do i realize how huge a compliment i was being given. 
 if you haven't read it, you should. if you have read it, you should probably read it again.... ok wow where do i even begin with this. 
 my summarized thoughts are that this was a waste of my time. i've seen a lot of reviews where people say this read like fanfiction and they would be correct. because this is fanfiction. jk rowling did not write this. i will repeat, jk rowling did not write this. 
 with that cleared up, this shouldn't exist. the play was not meant to be read like this, it was meant to be seen. if they wanted a book they should have made a novelized version but instead they took the easy way out. and on top of that, as a script, it was horrible. it's an insult to call this the 8th harry potter book. 
 things i liked: 
 -scorpius is a beautiful ray of sunshine and does not deserve to be associated with this nonsense 
 specific things i didn't like 
 -so many of the characters said and did things that didn't feel genuine to them 
 -ron was pretty much a joke (and i never really cared for him before) but he was basically just there to add comical background noise 
 -voldemort has a daughter???? are.you.serious? 
 -thinking about voldemort procreating makes me want to vomit 
 -the timer turner plot was ridiculous 
 -and also so convenient. everything got wrapped up in a neat little bow 
 -scorpius has a crush on rose. ok suuuuure whatever you say 
 -albus and scorpius are gay and in love. i will fight you on that 
 -harry being a horrible father. and saying it was because he didn't have a father figure to learn from. what! ummmmm hagird? sirius? lupin? why don't you just spit on their graves while you're at it harry 
 one star for the beauty that is scorpius malfoy. zero stars for everything else 
 would i recommend this?? no. 
 i am off to return this and get my money back it was alright. it was just alright. 
 i know i gave this 4 stars, but to be honest, j.k. rowling can write a dictionary with harry potter illustrations and i'd probably give it 4 stars, so my rating is almost irrelevant here, given my extreme bias. 
 the thing is, it was cute, it was sweet, it was entirely nostalgic to see the old crew again, but i hated the play format. as a person who grew up with harry potter, and who is in her early 30s now, i feel like i grew up with harry potter and the crew, and with the advent of this book, i have, in fact, grown old with them. it was lovely to see them again. it was like meeting old friends. 
 i don't feel old. i'm a more responsible person, for sure, but i feel young at heart. when we're young, adulthood, responsibilities, just the prospect of adulting seem so daunting...then one gets there and it's like, well, i'm as immature as i ever was. i love fun as much as i ever did. growing old isn't that bad. and seeing the old crew being as much as they ever were brings joy into my not-yet-old-and-grizzled-heart. 
 i could do without the kids, to be honest. oh, sure, they're little potter and granger-weasley spawns, but come on, nobody ever has and nobody ever will win me over as much as their parents, whom i have loved the instant we met them on the hogwarts express. 
 (ok, maybe not ron...) 
 but i digress. the kids aren't all bad. i rather like little scorpius, actually. 
 scorpius: and it's just like my father's! i got his nose, his hair, and his name. not that that's a great thing either. i mean -- father-son issues, i have them. but, on the whole, i'd rather be a malfoy than, you know, the son of the dark lord. 
 the adults have grown, they've changed. some have changed so much that i hardly recognize them, draco, for instance. i like that he's, well, nicer now, but he doesn't feel like draco, you know? i've been so used to harry and draco doing this... 
 that it's rather discombobulating to see anything otherwise. 
 but yeah, characters are great, but the format. the format. 
 i don't even know it's fair of me to judge this based on the fact that i don't like that it's a play, because for fuck's sakes, it's a play. like, what did i expect? this may be the most confusing review i've ever written. i just don't like the play format. it's meant for the stage. that means it's up to the skill of the actors to portray what is implied. it's up to the audience to interpret nuances. it is almost entirely based on dialogue, and i hate that. i miss rowling's writing. i love rowling's writing, and i wanted more of it. the play brings up so many things that could have been written so much more, had it been expanded into a book format. the children's growing pains, particular that of young albus. harry's feelings as a parent. draco's struggles with who he was and who he is. furthermore, ron is relegated to little more than comic relief. let's be honest, i never liked the guy, but for him to be much of the same character that he ever was conjures up the image of the try-hard middle-aged dude, and i know that ron is more than that. 
 i like it? i don't like it? i don't know. but i would certainly relish watching it on the stage if i ever had the chance. it's bound to be better than on paper. with acol hitting shelves this month, i guess it's time to finally mark it as read...i don't know what else to say, except i've never been prouder of a book, and i really hope my readers enjoy the end of this journey. okay, so the good things: i liked the world/mythology/etc, and was amused by the anne rice reference! and i also liked the subtle pro-gay marriage message. 
 it could have actually been a lot of fun except for the romance part, which went like this: (spoilers!) 
 diana: i am exceptionally good at being a historian of science, and i even have a job at yale! i am also a witch, but i don't use my powers. much. 
 gosh this mysterious manuscript sure is mysterious! 
 matthew: i am tall. i went through your papers and then came to your house and watched you sleep. 
 also, i'm an ancient vampire. 
 diana: um, okay? 
 matthew: say would you like to do some vampire yoga with me? 
 that is not a euphemism, by the way. 
 diana: i guess so. i could do that after i go rowing and then run several miles. 
 matthew: i have a lot of useful information that i'm not going to tell you. 
 also, you smell amazing. i can barely control myself when you're around. 
 diana: oh well, i'm sure it's fine. 
 matthew: i forbid you to do various things. 
 also, your life is in danger so we're going to visit my mom. in france. did i mention i'm french? 
 diana: hey, for serious you can't just tell me what to do all the time. 
 matthew: i am coldly furious. 
 also, it makes me sad when you disobey me. and i hate being sad. 
 you know what, i was sad once a thousand years ago and then i killed a bunch of people. and then it happened this other time and i killed my lover, just so you know. 
 diana: oh, right! silly me. so wilful. anyway, should we have sex now? 
 matthew: what? why would we do that? 
 matthew: oh by the way this is my housekeeper. 
 she is also an ancient vampire, but for some reason i guess she likes keeping house. 
 housekeeper: oh hi, here is some herbal tea! make sure to drink it every day, and don't make any mistakes when you brew it. um, because it might taste bad, not that it's having any effect on you without your knowledge. or anything like that. 
 diana: gosh, thanks! everyone is so nice here. 
 matthew: your eyes are like starlight now 
 diana: i love you! 
 matthew: hang on, i need to go back to england for something. 
 matthew: i am back from england! i love you! 
 diana: i feel our souls are as one! these few short weeks have shown me that you are my one true love! 
 matthew: oh hey did i mention, you know that time i kissed you in front of my mom? well that means we're married. 
 diana: actually you did not mention that. but does this mean we can have sex? 
 matthew: hahahaha don't be silly! 
 matthew: oh and another thing, there is this compact or something that says witches and vampires cannot marry! so there are a bunch more people trying to kill us! 
 diana: what 
 matthew: oh yeah totally! but don't worry because it turns out you are the most magical of all the witches! 
 diana: yeah except my powers are all repressed, anyway i'm just going to go outside for a second and i'm sure i won't get kidnapped and tortured or anything. 
 matthew: i will kill everyone and summon the secret brotherhood of ancient secret knights!! 
 matthew's mom and housekeeper: wow, calm down. 
 matthew: okay i will just kill this one lady then. 
 diana: yay, i learned to fly! i <3 you matthew!! i am so lucky to be your bride! let's go visit my aunt in america. did i tell you i'm from america? 
 anyway, let's have some sex! woo! 
 matthew: i don't know what you're talking about. 
 aunt: why are you drinking contraceptive tea? 
 diana: i have no idea. not because of all the sex i'm having, that's for sure. 
 matthew: what?? i will kill you, housekeeper! 
 diana: never mind, we have to go to the past and do something about that mysterious manuscript. did i mention i loooove you!!!?!?!? 
 matthew: speaking of which, christopher marlowe was totally in love with me! we should go say hi. 
 diana: i see. so is that why we can't have sex? 
 matthew: what? no! it's because of the purity and specialness! 
 matthew: also, have i mentioned how you have alllll of the witch powers? you are the best witch of all time! 
 diana: i love you! 
 the end this book cost me around 600 dollars. 
 when i'm traveling to and from conventions, i use the airplane time to catch up on my reading. a lot of times this means i'm taking the opportunity to read books that have been popular for a while, but that i haven't gotten around to. i feel like i should be aware of the landscape. 
 anyway, on my way home from seattle, i had a layover in minneapolis. i grabbed this book so i'd have something to read while i was eating dinner in the airport. 
 so i ate dinner, and i read the book, and i lost track of time, and i missed my plane. 
 i ended up having to rent a car and drive the three and a half hours back to stevens point. 
 you win this round, cassandra clare.... video review - http://bit.ly/1rlgyvm 
 new addition to my ""all time favorites"" list. possibly new #1 all time favorite. i adored this book. funny and cute and clever with a cool plot and fun world and plenty of squee-inducing moments. i've read the whole book through twice, going on my third read. and there are some chapters i've read at least six or seven times. and the book has been out a week. i'm obsessed. i put the book down and all i want is to pick it up again. aleister crowley, i'm living a charmed life. lady midnight tore me apart then pieced me back together....then tore me apart again. 
 loved this book! 
 a very detailed review will be up on my channel later this week! :) spoilery book discussion here - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_gl7... 
 this was absolutely everything i wanted and never knew i needed. thank you sarah for this perfect beautiful book. 
 here are some of my spoiler-free impressions: 
 dorian. precious cinnamon roll. i can't. 
 aelin. queen of shadows. more like queen of slaying yasssss get it girl. 
 rowan. i'm screaming. 
 chaol. more screaming. 
 aedion!!! lysandra!!! manon!!! arobynn!!!!!!!!! 
 i had about twelve heart attacks while reading this book. it was awesome. this book was outstanding! i don't even understand how sjm was able to make this jump from book one. i mean, this book is leagues above the first in this series. 
 damn. 
 damn. 
 so. good. so this book is coming out on the 28th of october, just two weeks away, and i'm growing increasingly nervous. 
 this isn't an unusual thing. authors are always anxious before the release of a book. we worry if people will like it. we worry about the publisher being satisfied with the sales. we worry about the translations being good. 
 i am all those types of worried. but i have other worries too. 
 one of my biggest concerns is that despite my best efforts to spread the word, people will pick this book up thinking it's book three. (it's not.) if that happens, they can't help but be disappointed. if you take a drink expecting milk and get orange juice instead, you're going to be unhappy. it doesn't matter how good the orange juice is. it's shocking and unpleasant. 
 equally troubling to me is the thought that people will see this book and think, ""oh, i've heard of that rothfuss guy. maybe i'll try him out..."" 
 and then they'll pick up this book and start reading. and it won't make one damn bit of sense to them because they don't have any idea who auri is. because this story is about her. this is auri's book. 
 for all these reasons, i wrote my first ever author's foreword. i expected my editor to cut it. but she didn't. and when i asked her if i could share it here. she said i could. 
 so here it is. 
 * * * 
 you might not want to buy this book. 
 i know, that's not the sort of thing an author is supposed to say. the marketing people aren't going to like this. my editor is going to have a fit. but i'd rather be honest with you right out of the gate. 
 first, if you haven't read my other books, you don't want to start here. 
 my first two books are the name of the wind and the wise man's fear. if you're curious to try my writing, start there. they're the best introduction to my world. this book deals with auri, one of the characters from that series. without the context of those books, you're probably going to feel pretty lost. 
 second, even if you have read my other books, i think it's only fair to warn you that this is a bit of a strange story. i don't go in for spoilers, but suffice to say that this one is... different. it doesn't do a lot of the things a classic story is supposed to do. and if you're looking for a continuation of kvothe's storyline, you're not going to find it here. 
 on the other hand, if you'd like to learn more about auri, this story has a lot to offer. if you love words and mysteries and secrets. if you're curious about the underthing and alchemy. if you want to know more about the hidden turnings of my world.... 
 well, then this book might be for you. i have never wanted so badly for the characters in a book to be real. i want to meet them all the way i want to meet the president, or taylor swift. 
 this story is perfectly told. it is perfectly paced, it is brilliantly written, it is beautifully crafted. 
 andy weir does this incredible thing where he make the reader feel the isolation that mark wagner feels, and he does it so subtly, we don't even realize that he's doing it until it's done. 
 the martian completely captivated me. i couldn't wait to find out what happened next, and i never wanted it to end. i wrote this book, so i'm probably biased. since it's early, and the full jacket copy isn't out, here's a list of things in adsom: 
 -magic 
 -cross-dressing thieves 
 -(aspiring) pirates 
 -londons (plural) 
 -sadistic kings (and queens) 
 -a royal who is equal parts prince harry and jack harkness 
 -more magic (blood magic, elemental magic, bad magic, etc. etc.) 
 -epic magicky fights scenes 
 -angst! 
 -and coats with more than two sides how to write popular ya supernatural literature and defile your spirit! 
 based on the popular ya novel, evermore, and aided by countless more like it, i have compiled an easy to read and follow list of rules for writing a popular series and being able to sell out your soul at the same time. does that sound too convenient? well, it's unbelievably easy to do if you follow my quick and easy program! 
 1. create an 'outcast' heroine. 
 it's important that your primarily female teenage audience can relate to your main character. so whilst you can't have your main character associate herself with being cool, it still has to be obvious to your audience that she totally is. now, meyer's approach of the goose-turned swan-but was really still a goose, bella, associated herself as 'different' and a 'loner' only to arrive at her new school and be immediately popular and accepted by almost everyone. noel's method is different yet in a similar spirit. her protagonist, ever, was incredibly popular at her old school and has decided to be an outcast because she feels that she can't be accepted due to her psychic gift. she also has the ability to perceive someone's personality through the colours that define them. so instead of aligning herself with the shallow, mean and popular crowd, she aligns herself with the shallow and mean loners. 
 it's very important for your protagonists to be 'different' because today's youth despise the sheep mentality and so they all strive to be unique. since they're all different in almost the exact same way, it is relatively easy to emulate this, with as little effort put into characterization as possible, in your female protagonist. 
 as long as she shows no regard for her clothing, appearance or any kind of interest in giving a shit about anyone but herself she will easily pass with young audiences. it will be her ewniqueness that eventually draws the perfect hero to her as opposed to any of the usual elements such as: looks, hygiene, personality or determinable interest in the world outside their own arse. 
 please also remember that she probably should be a reader, preferably of wuthering heights or romeo and juliet and that she should consider everyone around her to have inferior intelligence despite the fact that her reading repertoire extends to only a couple of books. 
 a noticeably absent family is necessary and a completely dead family makes for a better story because then she actually has a perceived reason to be a moody, antisocial, self-absorbed little bitch. do this even though, in all likelihood, she would be all of the above with a perfectly normal family. 
 2. create a perfect hero. 
 it is very important that your hero be perfect in almost every regard. unlike the female protagonist who can disregard her appearance, he must not only be more attractive than a gq model without any of the effort put into his appearance, but he must also be thoughtful, intelligent and mysterious. 
 in no way is he to reflect almost every teenage boy to have ever existed and he must have no desire to find a partner for himself who is in anyway comparable in looks, kindness, intelligence or perfection. 
 if he is a vampire or some such immortal then he must be ridiculously wealthy. if he is a werewolf then he is allowed to be poor but must make up for it with incredible bedroom skills. 
 he needn't have a personality that extends beyond mysterious, sexy and in love with the female protagonist. naturally, in this respect, meyers, mead, marr and stiefvater are something like overachievers - but if noel, saintcrow, clare, kate and fitzpatrick are any indication, then we need know little more about the hero other than the fact that he's gorgeous, has a secret and is in love. history, friends, likes, dislikes, family, passions, interests, hobbies and personality flaws are all negligible information that is taking up precious space in your novel. especially when you could be injecting more drooling from the female protagonist in place of any kind of characterization for your hero. 
 your book will sell better if the hero stalks, follows, obsesses over and actively pursues the heroine beyond any realm of believability. you could triple your audience just by having him watch her sleep. 
 3. create useless friends. 
 it's important to reiterate to the young adult generation that nobody other than the hero is important. since domestic abuse begins with one partner manoeuvring the other to have limited contact with anyone else, we must strive to normalize this in literature. thus the female protagonist shouldn't have anyone close enough to her that she can't break contact or eventually forget about them. it's very important that her full focus, socialization and all of her needs are eventually devoted or met by the male protagonist. 
 to aid this, her friends must be selfish, vain, crazy, slutty, uncaring or in other ways undeserving of the heroine's attentions and affections. it's very important that she never call them on their poor, damaging and graceless friendship but must lovingly worry about them for the minimal amount of time acceptable to the reader before once again completely focusing on the mysterious hero. 
 4. mix in a twisted, convoluted plot designed entirely to provide dramatic and sexy subplot. 
 it's important that the plot, no matter how unlikely, must revolve around the hero saving the heroine. the villains do not necessarily need to have realistic or conceivable motivations for their actions. as long as the hero gets to save the day at least three or four times then your book will be profitable! 
 please remember that the actual plot of your story needn't truly begin until at least 350 pages into your story. the longer you can stall any interesting event occuring, the less thinking you will actually need to do. 
 plus - for free - extras to help 'improve' your novel, the bottom line of your sales, and the expedient destruction of your soul. 
 -how to create a senseless mythology. 
 mythology is more of a concept rather than something that needs to be respected or honoured. vampires don't need to refrain from daylight and angels no longer need to ""fall"" for good they can now be redeemed like us! the good news is that creating your own mythology, disregarding anything written before, allows you to twist and bastardize the plot beyond any recognizably interesting concept! 
 -explanations as to why research could actually damage your profit! 
 research takes time, energy and intelligence. why do it? you've got ten fingers (presumably) and an attention span that extends past anything that could be compared to a gnat (even if it is only barely). simply make it up as you go! for example: ever is psychic. research may tell us that this has something to do with receiving visions of the future or possibly commnicating with ghosts. yet research is boring. instead, she is imbued with the following powers that we guess can kind of be put under a psychic umbrella if we force enough information and logic out of our brains first: mind reading, visions of near-present and future, personal life knowledge of any person she physically touches, seeing ghosts, seeing auras, literary osmosis from touching any written object, drawing the answers from any written question placed before her and any other supernatural abilities that seem convenient at the time. 
 -detailed observations on why the deus ex machina rocks. 
 tying together a plot, even if you work to keep it as non-complicated or infantile as possible, is hard! it's much easier to ignore tying together a number of plot points in any believable fashion and instead rely on some deus ex machina to come in and take care of thoughtful planning for you! 
 -how to expand one, nonsensical idea into a series and why this is more profitable than originality! 
 last, but not least! ensure that your story is somewhat open ended so that you can create a series out of it! research shows that people, even if they are intelligent enough to see that you're writing is becoming progressively shittier and nonsensical, will often still purchase books in the series in order to find out what happens. so rather than creating a new story with new characters, simply beat the same old horse (it needn't really be a horse - simply a pile of shit that's been forced into a horse-like shape) for at least three or more books in order to squeeze every last cent out of the franchise that you can!

 review to come. well, it's done. and it's been a long time coming... 
 back in late 2009 i finally got the book to the point where i was satisfied with it. it was an okay book. it was a book that if i had to publish it, i knew it wouldn't embarrass me. 
 by may 2010 i'd re-written the book to the point where i was happy with it. it was a good book. it was a book i was pleased with. 
 by my final deadline in november 2010, i'd revised things to the point where i was excited about it. it was a great book. it was finally a book i was proud of.... 
 i'm glad my editor gave me enough time for this. i'm glad i have a book i'm excited to have on the shelves. 
 i hope when it comes out on march first, you enjoy it. it was a long time coming.... this first part was originally written in 2012. 
 jesus the book isn't even out yet and you guys are trashing it already. seriously, wait at least until it comes out, read it and then give your opinion. right now it's just useless and pissing all of us fans off. she's not milking this. if she really just wanted more money, she wouldn't work so hard on all of this beautiful material she's creating for us. for us. she doesn't have to do this, she could be working as a doctor or a lawyer and making money. and if you think those two jobs are harder and that writing is easier, you're 100% wrong. it's not easy, it's hard as hell but she does it. and she does it beautifully. it's even harder to get published and get enough books sold. do your research before you go around calling people cash cows. we've all got to make a living. some people do it by working at jobs that they absolutely hate and some, like ms. clare, do it by sticking with what they're passionate about. so what if she makes money? her books are amazing and if you don't like them, that's fine. but it's rude to trash talk a series that isn't even written yet. in fact, it's rude to trash talk anything but the least you could do is hold off until you have something to trash talk. 
 ---- 
 oh my god. i knew this book would be amazing and it was. so. freaking. amazing. 
 cassandra clare, you have done it yet again. you've managed to make me care so much about characters i just met and made me feel their happiness, pain, sadness as if it were my own. i was so sad when i saw the last page. and then the last conversation... really? really?! gah! 
 i really hope that the people who were trash talking have read it and been stunned. she created yet another beautiful masterpiece and i was more than happy to spend money on it. i need more...... as always, after reading something by sanderson, i find myself irritated at how good he is. 
 so let's take it as a given that the book has all the essential ingredients: character, plot, dialogue, mystery, and action. all of these things are there, some of them merely great, most of them included to exceptional degree. 
 what truly impresses me though, is that sanderson has done something extraordinarily unique with this book. something that just isn't done in fantasy. 
 first, sanderson wrote the mistborn trilogy, an amazingly good fantasy trilogy set it in a unique, carefully-constructed world with a well defined magic system. 
 then he moved that world forward 300 years. he evolved it away from the low-industrial/dark-ages culture into a much more modern setting. 
 this simply isn't done. 
 you see, here's the way things work: 
 1. you either write secondary world fantasy which is pretty medievally, or renaissance-y, or occationally dark-ages-ish. maybe you go crazy and make it kinda asian. or you make it bronze age. that's rare though. pretty fringe. 
 2. your other option is to set something in this world. most of the time when you do this, the setting is modern, which gets you urban fantasy. if you're not quite so modern, you get steampunk. if you go back further than that, it's alternate history. but again, that's kinda rare. 
 these are the rules. they're not written down anywhere, but generally speaking, that's how things work. this is just the way things are done. 
 but sanderson has done something different here. two somethings, actually. 
 1. he evolved his world through time, changing the society significantly while staying true to the world he established in the earlier mistborn books. 
 (yeah yeah. there have been a few other authors that have done this. frank herbert, for example. but it's so rare as to be practically unique. and in my opinion sanderson has done it better than herbert did for the simple fact that i want to read sanderson's future books in this world, while i just couldn't make it through the second dune sequel.) 
 2. sanderson has written urban fantasy that isn't set in this world. call it what you want, urban fantasy, qua-western, steampunk, whatever. that's what he did. 
 i read this book and found myself thinking, ""what? you can do that? how come nobody's done this before?"" 
 this is what happens with all truly clever innovation. once someone does it, it seems obvious. it seems like anyone could do it. 
 but everyone didn't do it. sanderson did. that's a very special sort of clever. 
 what's my point? 
 my point is that this book is good, and you should give it a try. 
 my other point is that this book does something different, and pulls it off very smoothly, so you should give it a try. 
 my last point is that sanderson has now been added to a very short list of authors. specifically, the list authors whom i wish to kill so that i might eat their livers and thereby gain their power. 
 so yeah. my hat's off to you, brandon. watch your back. you know, i really hadn't foreseen the publication of something to lengthen harry potter's story after the conclusion that was harry potter and the deathly hallows. 
 so, the way i see it, harry potter and the cursed child is a lovely gift to every harry potter fan out there who has hoped and waited a long time to see their wizard friends again. 
 though the plot holes are very visible and spread throughout the story, they make for charming and heartfelt conversations between characters, so i didn't mind them all that much. 
 the best thing about this #8 harry potter is how nostalgic it makes the reader feel. there are plenty of familiar faces - harry, ginny, draco, hermione, ron, dumbledore, etc - as well as some interesting new ones - albus, rose, scorpius, lily, james... 
 admittedly, it was strange to read this supposedly 8th story in harry potter's world in play format but the truth is, it was extremely easy to imagine everything play out like in a movie, so it all felt alive to me. 
 this isn't a book you have to read but, if you're a diehard harry potter fan, i am going to look at you quite incredulously if you decide not to. i'm sadly not going to be able to tell you that you're making the right choice, because this is so, so charming and fun, but i can understand people wanting to have their own vision of the harry potter cast as adults and their children. yes, it's a bit silly but... i loved it still. 
 blog | youtube | twitter | instagram | google+ | bloglovin' one of my favorite books of the year! i feel like i can't say much because of spoilers, but i love the characters i love the story i love the romance i just love it all. 
 *re-read april 2017 this book totally wrecked me. in the best possible way (because iaeur(tm)m thrilled to cry for a day straight? idk). first of all, the scope of this story is extraordinary. events from the first half that seemed so important at the time now feel like minuscule details in the face of this epic plot. 
 i love how maas writes such complex characters who have had their lives shattered in a variety of ways, yet still keep fighting for each other and work to create a new life with the family they chose. feyreaeur(tm)s growth from the first book where she had such low self-worth is beyond inspirational as she finds the ability to completely forgive & love herself and everything sheaeur(tm)s been. sheaeur(tm)s still a flawed character who makes some sketchy calls and is continually healing. and that's what i love most about this book: every single character is broken and healing. lucien, elain, nesta, cassian, azriel, mor, rhys, amren, even tamlin. everyone. and the amount they care about each other is just 
 maas manages to juggle a wide range of characters in this book, add in even more, and find really creative ways to show whataeur(tm)s happening with other ships besides rhys & feyre. i think if you look at this as just a conclusion to the trilogy then a lot of storylines are kind of underwhelming because it's mostly setting up potential for future books with a lot of the side characters. but i was just excited for any page time for cassian, nesta, elain, and azriel! 
 i also loved how everyone finds a different way to be strong (like in ways besides brute strength) and the story actually shows the horrors of war without glorifying killing. thereaeur(tm)s a theme of the choices & consequences of war and how one life can change the world: it occurred to me today when i sat down to write a review of this book, that i've never gone into detail about my dresden files obsession online. 
 that said, it's certainly there, in bits and pieces, pretty obvious for anyone who is willing to read between the lines. 
 and i've talked about my love for the series in public many, many times. usually in response to the question, ""so what are your favorite books?"" or ""what should i read while i'm waiting for book three to come out?"" 
 but i've never really stated the depth of my love plainly, all in one place, for all the world to see. 
 so. 
 the dresden files is my favorite series ever. i say that both as a writer, and a reader. 
 think about that for a moment. i don't make statements like that casually. 
 as a series, dresden trumps out everything else i've ever read, or am currently reading. that includes books i *overflow* with love for, like lynch's gentleman bastard series. or robin hobb's farseer. or sanderson's mistborn. or abercrombie's first law... 
 i like the dresden files more than i like wizard of earthsea. more than i like zelazny's chronicles of amber. more than gaiman's sandman. more the lord of the rings. 
 as a series, the dresden files even beats out pratchett's discworld. there. i said it. 
 i love these books so much that when ghost story came out, i read the *entire* series starting at book one, so i would be ready for the newest book. 
 then when cold days came out, i read the *entire* series again. 
 that's something i haven't done since high school. i don't have time for that shit. nevertheless, i did it. 
 for this book, skin game, i would probably have done the same thing again. but this time my obsession went even further. i decided to viciously abuse my meager power as an author. i contacted jim's editor and begged for an advance reading copy. 
 she graciously gave me one, probably because the intensity of my request frightened her. plus nobody wants to see a big beardy man cry. it's just not an appealing thing. 
 so what did i think of this book? i loved it. 
 i won't spoil anything. i don't go in for that sort of thing. 
 i'll just say that i loved it. it's everything i'd hoped for. and that jim made me cry, like, four goddamn times in this book. 
 you're walking a thin line, butcher. i'd hate you if i didn't love you so much... ughhhhh i neeeeddd morrrreeeeee ""graceling meets selection"" whatever marketing team came up with that tag for this series clearly never read the book. red queen is game of thrones with katniss as the mockingjay with x-men in a tantalizing ya twist of magical perfection. 
 three quotes that summarize this series spoiler-free: 
 ""anyone can betray anyone."" meet the lannisters silver court and their current royal family. 
 ""make no mistake, my girl. you are playing the game as someone's pawn."" 
 ""i am a fool."" 
 sooooooooo... my initial reaction: 
 i have to wait another year??? let me repeat: i have to wait another year??? 
 ...yeaaaaa, i'm totally cool with that. not. 
 okay, now before i go all crazy fan girl let me start by saying that no one, and i repeat, no one, had higher expectations for this than me (well, maaaaybe victoria:d). i am the world's biggest medieval/dystopian ya fantasy nut & i have been looking for a book like this my whole life. my whole life, people!!! so it isn't a high stretch of imagination to say with all the hype i was expecting to be let down. because let's face it: most of the hype let's you down (thank you million dollar marketing campaigns for all the *cough, cough* next-big-things). 
 (and in case you are wondering i never wanted to read hunger games or harry potter so while those blew my mind in a totally awesome way they were never really on my tbr to begin with, red queen on the other hand has been a book i thought i would love from the beginning). 
 and then the hype got bigger: 
 reviewers i follow and love start saying magical words like ""shatter me,"" ""darkling,"" and ""x-men-like powers."" 
 so this was me one minute before midnight when red queen released: 
 and guess what??? it beat my over-hyped up imagination. this book is now one of my favorites of all time!!! red queen is everything a ya medieval fantasy should be. i loved every minute of it. 
 alright. now to my actual thoughts on this book. i marked the whole thing as a spoiler because i am lazy but yea, trust me when i say you don't want this ruined (so read on at your own peril): 
 1. ""little lightning girl."" okay, yea, the way they use her reminded me a lot of mockingjay. not going to lie. 
 2. cal - shame on you, you hot beautiful prince, you. you were totally scamming and making move's on your brother's girl. i know you are supposed to come off as this nice guy but before maven turned out to be evil i seriously did not like you. i mean i was totally rooting for you and mare (*gasps that dance scene*) but i was mad at you for being the popular/likable guy when you were totally secretly making eyes at your brother's wife that you know he's falling for. that said i still loved your romance scenes and i do like you. i will admit to my sickness. 
 3. maven. maven, maven, maven. hello darkling meets joffrey. kind of like malfoy with a heart. y'all know that scene in harry potter i'm talking about: 
 so needless to say i am secretly in love with him. because i am shameless and always root for the complicated guy and/or villain love interest. 
 #teamwarnerdarklingmorpheusjacedamonsalvatoredaemonblack -and now maven. 
 4. this book totally has a love triangle (maybe more, you can never tell with the childhood friend what's-his-name). but strangely enough i enjoyed it. it played out to my guilty pleasure side. if maven wasn't in this book i would totally be in love with cal, and vice versa. i loved them both. the only other time i have loved both guys in a love triangle was cassandra clare's infernal devices series (and even then i still obviously preferred will, but i was definitely okay with both). 
 5. there were definite cliches/overused tropes: 
 ""you're going to be his brother's wife. and he's going to war."" 
 ""i am the little lightning girl, and i am going to make the world change."" 
 ... but i was down with them. because tropes & cliches are there for a reason. we all secretly love them. we just don't love them when the writing sucks. 
 only trope i hated: the instalove with cal & mare, i was cool with it until (i apologize for the rant) this happened: 
 maven shakes his head. ""he [cal] will always choose you."" 
 >> really? yea, he liked her but now everyone was suddenly ""cal will choose you over his country?"" umm. no. that part annoyed me to no end because while i was down with instalike i was not down with instalove (and i did not interpret cal as that much of an idiot). thank the gods that turned out not to be true. it's cool that cal hesitated but if he had actually chosen mare i would have lost respect for him. instead i gained so much more for him standing up to her and turning her in. way to go, cal!!! 
 6. the brother shade. wtf? why didn't the guard tell her about him if he was still alive? that twist annoyed me. they didn't suspect maven so they had no reason to keep it a secret. maybe i missed something but that was the only plot hole of the book and honestly it was so small i didn't care. 
 7. queen elara (enough said): ""like any wife, she hates her husband for challenging her, and like any queen, she hates the power the king holds over her."" 
 now onto my favorite scene... let's be honest: it was everyone's. we all knew a big twist was coming but it was still so epic. and helloooo darkling aka maven. i knew you were more than just your brother's shadow. 
 ""he rolls his shoulders, cracking his bones to chase away an ache. his motions are sluggish and strange, and when he settles back on his feet, hands on hips, i feel like i'm seeing him for the first time. his eyes are so cold."" 
 the queen was way too much of a biatch to just stand on the sidelines with the most awesome power (whisper!) of all. 
 ""because she already knew. because he is her son. because this was her plan all along."" 
 when malfoy/joffrey listened to cersei lannister maven listened to his mother i had this image in my head: 
 followed by a wish that mare had her powers back to do this: 
 i loved every minute of this book, guys. read it now. i literally bookmarked every single page. and not just the maven parts, guys, all of it!!! 
 and finally my favorite line of the whole book: 
 ""this was the shadow controlling the flame."" 
 yea, i know, i'm #teammaven. i know you are all #teamcal, hence i leave you with this: 
 omg i cannot wait for the next book!!! 'crap! my astronaut crewmates accidentally left me behind on mars! i'm fucked! i'm going to die! oh wait! i just thought of something highly logically unlikely and technically complicated, that i am sure to pull off without a hitch, because did i mention that i am plucky and ingenious? it sure is a good thing that i am super-talented! yay! that worked! i'm not dead! [next chapter] but wait! disaster has struck! shit happens, when you're stuck alone on mars. whatever shall i do? omg, i just had a great idea! it's a good thing i'm so naturally optimistic, because it sure would make for a bummer book if i ever showed any signs of being depressed or having any kind of mental deterioration after spending nearly two years in total solitude! nah, i've got the fightin' spirit! i can create a life support system out of duct tape! what does mars actually look like? is there anything interesting from a scientific perspective about it? who cares! i'm busy growing potatoes in shit and watching three's company! did i mention that disco sucks?' 
 repeat. 
 for a while. 
 i do not get the hype. this was amazing! it was exactly what i wanted from a series finale--epic, intense, emotional, and satisfying! just like with the previous books, i loved the world, the characters, the story, and the writing. this is one of my favorite series of all time, and i'm so so happy with this beautiful conclusion! 
 if you like sci-fi, fairy tale retellings, or you just want to read an epic & satisfying series--you need the lunar chronicles in your life! just. i cant. yes. this book. bless this book!!!!! that ending. damn. i can't even type in complete sentences after reading glass sword (even though i just did)..... little indian boy goes on weird boat ride with mean cat. i finished this book with tears in my eyes and laughter on my lips. 
 just wow, excellent book! nervous, but also so excited to return to this story, these people, this world. 
 lest anyone assume that i'm simply capitalizing on vicious's success, a note: 
 from the beginning, vicious was, in my mind, a series called the villains. ideally one with 3 parts: 
 vicious, vengeful, and victorious. 
 but publishing is a business, and vicious was my first adult genre title, and a seemingly niche one at that. the publisher and i both wanted it to be able to stand alone, so that if it didn't sell well enough to merit a sequel, readers wouldn't feel cheated or abandoned. i've always preferred writing books in a series with their own contained arcs, so it worked for me, but it was always my hope if not my expectation to continue the books. 
 i'm sure there are readers out there who would prefer vicious to stand alone, and it can! simply don't read the subsequent volumes ;) but for those who want more of victor and eli and the rest of the villainous crew, read on. this book is the result of bella swan being thrown into a fantasy world and trying to be katniss everdeen. she did not succeed. 
 ok more review: 
 i genuinely really enjoyed some aspects of this book, but i couldn't stand feyre, or tamlin... or anybody really, except for lucien. i feel like lucien was the only character who had an interesting back story, and he was just a much better presence than either of the main characters. 
 but the instalove. the instalove, guys. it kills me. also verrrrry problematic scenes, like when it was feyre's fault for almost getting raped? can you not? ""go back to your room feyre before i do something bad to you"" wow whoa really not cool. 
 on top of all that, i just found the plot to be incredibly boring. i started getting interested around the 200-page mark, but then it all just went back to being uninteresting again. i know in a status update i said that the book was slow, but what i should have said is that it was boring, because there is a huge difference. a book can be fast-paced and still be boring, and vice versa. i love slow-paced books. have you seen how much i loved the name of the wind and the game of thrones books? those are slow. but not boring. this was boring. 
 that's how i felt anyway, it's my opinion. if you weren't bored by this book, that's awesome. however, i will never lie to you about my opinion. so here we are. let's play a little game of: 
 who am i... 
 -my book starts with me moving to a new location and starting at a new school. 
 -i live with just my dad, but don't worry about him, he's not important. in fact, you'll barely notice he exists at all! 
 -i quickly make friends at my new school. i'm not sure why everyone likes me. i'm not remotely interesting. 
 -i've never had a boyfriend before meeting my love interest and for some reason people at my school find that hard to believe. 
 -as soon as my love interest catches my eye, i can't get him out of my mind. he's the mysterious type, but he only has eyes for me. he quickly becomes my boyfriend and we fall deeply in love. *swoon* 
 -my boyfriend happens to have a sibling who simply adores me. how could she not, i'm so awesome! she has a super special sight too. p.s. her name starts with an ""a."" 
 -my b-b-boyfriend---sorry that was me swooning again; he's so super howt *giggle*---also has another sibling that doesn't seem to like me at first. they are always glaring at me! it unnerves me. but i can get through anything with my boy toy by my side! oh, and p.s. their name starts with an ""r."" 
 -my boyfriend just happens to save my life with his mysterious powers. at first when i confront him about it, he plays it off. it really upsets me. it just wasn't fair!!! 
 -he later tells me that he can't stay away from me any longer and soon after he takes me to his home to really introduce me to his family. 
 -i find out he's been stalking me for a while. but it doesn't bother me. i find it incredibly romantic. 
 -*psst*, if my boyfriend and i were to have a baby, it would be some strange half-breed child. 
 -randomly out of nowhere i'm kidnapped by a tracker. i'm not sure where he came from because this book is all about me and my one true love. 
 -when i'm not hanging out with my boyfriend or getting abducted, i can be found brushing my teeth, eating cereal, doing homework or cooking for my dad. oh, and i hate being the center of attention. i'm so selfless. 
 -by the end of my book, i end up in the hospital. 
 so....who am i? 
 if you guessed bella swan you are correct! but if you guessed megan rosenberg, you are also correct! don't bother looking up to the top of the screen. this is indeed a carrier of the mark review or as i like to call it twilight 2.0 or better yet, carrier of the twilight or twi-remix or twilight goes to ireland or, or, or...okay you get the picture. and no, i'm not kidding all the above actually happens in this book. 
 i feel like i need to start saying how sorry i am to leigh fallon. truly, i am. you see, i'm in the middle of re-reading the twilight series and as a result, i am hyperaware of the twi-likeness this book has. i was really eager to get my hands on carrier of the mark, but you have no idea how disappointed i am in this book. so, it is with a heavy heart that i review twilight carrier of the mark again. 
 seventeen-year-old bella swan megan rosenberg moves to forks ireland after her dad, charlie caleb, accepts and new position at a yacht club. on her first day at school she notices a mysterious boy, named edward cullen adam deris, staring at her. she literally cannot stop thinking about him for the rest of the book. i'm not going to retell the book here, but if you've read twilight just sprinkle on a little air bender, add a pinch of captain planet, and toss a creepy baby on top and you pretty much have the recipe for carrier of the mark. instead, i'm going to be pulling a few select quotes with commentary pour moi. 
 adam randomly confesses his feelings to megan after have several staring contests: 
 they told me from the very beginning that it wasn't safe to 'consort,'"" he said, slightly wincing at the word, ""with you. but i'm not strong enough to stay away."" 
 now where have i heard that before? 
 twilight: 
 he heard the change in my tone. his eyes tightened. ""i don't seem to be strong enough to stay away from you..."" 
 a little pda action: 
 i put my hand on adam's face and felt along his cheek and down along his jaw, reveling in the softness of his skin in comparison to the light stubble. he closed his eyes. 
 ""you have no idea how good that feels,"" he murmured. 
 that sounds so familiar... 
 twilight: 
 ""do you mind?"" i asked, for he had closed his eyes again. 
 ""no,"" he said without opening his eyes. ""you can't imagine how that feels."" he sighed. 
 i lightly trailed my hand over the perfect muscles of his arm, followed the faint pattern of bluish veins inside the crease at his elbow. 
 rosalie rian doesn't like megan at first: 
 ""rian has a tough time accepting who we are and our purpose...i think he's just finding it hard to accept that you would opt in when you have the chance to walk away."" 
 now, who had the same issue? 
 twilight: 
 he sighed deeply. ""rosalie struggles the most with... with what we are. it's hard for her to have someone on the outside know the truth. and she's a little jealous...you're human."" he shrugged. ""she wishes that she were, too."" 
 there is a tracker following megan: 
 it's been years since we have even seen a tracker in ireland."" 
 ""is that what the guy in the theater was? a tracker?"" 
 ""i think so. we can't be sure at the moment, but he fits the usual profile. there's something different this time, though; he's getting around our defenses. we just don't know how he's doing it."" 
 funny that's just who was following bella too. 
 twilight: 
 ""he's a tracker, alice, did you see that? he's a tracker!"" 
 love interest serching for a way to protect heroine from the tracker: 
 ""don't apologize. i hate to see you hurting like that. please believe me when i tell you that i will make you safe."" 
 didn't edward promise the same thing in a very similar situation? 
 twilight: 
 ""soon, as soon as i possibly can. i will make you safe first."" his voice was hard. 
 a bad guy was snooping around megan's room and house. adam has his family guarding her, but somehow they manage to slip through: 
 ""someone was in her room, for christ's sake. in her room!"" 
 ""but i don't think he was still there when megan got home. if he had been, he would have acted right then and there. i'd say her mark was sensing that he'd been there earlier."" 
 rian shook his head. ""how is he getting around our senses? we've always known when the knox are close. this is bad."" 
 can't seem to put my finger on it..oh wait, i can. 
 twilight (eclipse): 
 ""he was in her room, alice. he could have still been there -- waiting for her."" 
 ""i would have seen that."" 
 edward threw his hands up in exasperation. ""really? you're sure?"" alice's voice was cold when she answered. ""you've already got me watching the volturis' decisions, watching for victoria's return, watching bella's every step. you want to add another? do i just have to watch charlie, or bella's room, or the house, or the whole street, too? edward, if i try to do too much, things are going to start slipping through the cracks."" 
 shitdamn 
 oh, but the similarities don't end there. right after adam reveals his feelings to megan, the very next day he takes her to meet his family. and if you remember that is exactly what edward did after he revealed all his feelings to bella in the meadow scene (confessions, chapter 13). aine alice, adam's sister also has a ""sight."" fionn carlisle is adam's adoptive father. adam admitted to stalking megan just like edward did to bella. megan confides in her best friend, caitlin, in math class. what do you know? that's the same place bella confided with jessica at. both adam and edward's eyes change color (interestingly, both share the same original color: green). 
 i just couldn't get past all the twilight references. i'm honestly baffled at how this book got published with all the shocking similarities because carrier of the mark reads just like a twilight fan-fic and not a good one. i'd give this book a freakin' ""a+"" for following the ""twilight book disaster"" recipe to the t, but an all around ""f"" (fail) for ya literature. i went though several different emotions while reading this book: shock, disbelief, finally settling on anger. anger? yes. did the author sit with her editor over tea and crumpets with their twilight copies on their laps pulling plots, quotes, and carbon copies of the characters? did they really think no one would pick up on the similarities?! well, i'll tell you something. my twilight copy is open on my lap right now and i am not amused one bit. this is something i expect from the usual offender cassie clare, not a debut ya author. and, man, i feel so bad writing this review. i absolutely hate giving a 1 star review to debut authors, but wow. i'm just blown this even saw the light of day. 
 and what's a twi-fan-fic without insta-love? this book has plenty of that and co-dependency. keep in mind they have been dating for 2 weeks. let me count the ways: 
 ""i feel like i could take on the world when i'm with you."" 
 i felt a new confidence building. i could take on the world with him by my side. 
 this felt so real. it seemed like my future was suddenly very clear. i had a whole new purpose--and it all revolved around this boy by my side. 
 everything else paled in significance. i could not live without him. as much as it upset me to hurt the others, it was nothing compared to the stabbing pain i felt when i thought of being parted from him. 
 and the more time that went by, the more i realized i could not live without adam. 
 wtf. i'm so tired of co-dependent relationships! is it a wonder why young girls think they need a boyfriend to survive? are these the ideals we want our youth to grow up learning? i don't take issue with megan being in love, but reading the statements above disturbs me. the entire book revolves around how in love she is with adam, so don't expect much of a plot in this book. the major conflict in the story comes out of nowhere and ends before it even begins, just as it did in twilight. 
 and, omg the mythology. it will make your head spin. we learn most of the world through god awful info-dumps. i read those pages over a few times and i still don't understand. perhaps if the author showed the reader instead of telling us, maybe i would have been able to keep up. the only thing i think i understood was that megan is carrier of a specific gene that would enable her to produce children to bear the mark. since carrier's are rare the order (a society that ""looks after"" the marked) specially selects the carrier's mates. i suppose being gay is out if you are a carrier, because you have a duty to produce babies! anyway, apparently it is forbidden for adam and megan to be together because if they have a child it could destroy the world. yeah...i don't get it either. once finding that out, megan decides she doesn't want to be a marked one anymore and help save the world. she wants to be with her romeo. 'cause being in love is more important than the safety of the world, donchaknow. and, please don't get me started on the whole 25-year-old pregnancy. i can't even. 
 fallon, you had all this potential. the setting was perfect: ireland! and you wasted your descriptions on megan eating her wheaties and putting on her red converses? *points to face* this is me not giving two shits. 
 cait, babe, you were right.

 /end rant \(-_-)/ 
 more reviews and more at cuddlebuggery book blog. probably my favorite book of 2015, didn't want it to end so i made it last as long as possible! reader logic: 
 i hate this book. 
 i hate it so much i had to get a new hardback copy to read so i could underline all the parts i hate about it so much and post them on goodreads. 
 i hate it with such a passion i also bought copies for all my friends and family, also in new hardback editions, so they could hate it along with me. 
 when the tv series came on i was so fuming with rage i watched the entire season twice and bought six copies of the dvd, because i could not believe how much i could hate something. 
 i had spent so much time discussing how much i hate this, with all my friends, who hate it too and who all bought copies, i decided to get a george rr martin tattoo on my buttock to show how strong my hatred for his work is. 
 there was such a collectivity at the time--like everyone uniting in hating this together--that some of us formed relationships in hate. i met my wife at a george rr martin convention and we got married as one of the characters, reciting parts of the book for our vows, and paid grrm all our life savings to come read from his horrible book. 
 we hate this beyond belief. maybe one day, we'll read a book we like, and the author can get rich on love. i can't remember the last time a book made my heart feel this empty and this full at the same time. man, what a magnificent installment. the story here is so epic and sprawling, and the way it's told--especially the pacing, how the different story threads were woven together--it was just perfect. not to mention that i love these characters so much it makes my heart ache. waiting for the next book is already causing me pain and we've still got two whole years to go. gah. i am still #teammaven. scroll down to the spoiler portion of my review to read my theory on his redemption arc. i'm either right or dead wrong, but my gut is telling me to there is more to maven than meets the eye. 
 ""mare, i am very afraid for you. things have been done to you, things no person should suffer. you've seen horrible things, done horrible things, and they will change you. i'm so afraid for what you could be, if given the wrong chance."" 
 enter the world of shades of gray. no character will be spared. 
 i finished. and i have many, many thoughts. let me try to get them down coherently in gif's (find my review of red queen here): 
 1. first 50% i was mostly bored. >>not that the writing wasn't amazing, because it was, or because there wasn't action, because there was, but because there was little romance and no maven and no palace and i just wasn't as entertained as the first book. but that all changed the second half when things got good... 
 2. a certain someone's death hit me harder than expected. 
 >> i didn't like this person at all in the first book, and now i'm thinking i should read one of the novellas to get more of this character. 
 3. i really loved mare in this book. 
 >>i'm sure some reviews will say she was moping and angry but honestly she was real. mare struggled to make the right decisions and be who they wanted her to be and she was haunted by the events of book one. (again, this series reminds me a lot of mockingjay-katniss feels, but for me that's a wonderful thing because i loved hunger games and would gladly read scenes like that over and over. i got why it was so hard of her to let go of protecting killorn and move into some sort of friendship with cal. i liked that she didn't know how to interact with the children and people kept looking at her like she was a traitor to both red and silver. i liked the way she kept the notes from maven and the way she and cal still mourned the boy they thought they had known. 
 4. the ending. oh dear lawd that ending. now that was an ending. 
 his expression is unreadable, but his meaning is clear. with one hand, he points at his feet. his fingers whiter than i remember. 
 i do as he says. 
 i kneel. 
 >> read below to understand my thoughts (everything is marked as a spoiler fyi): 
 that ending with maven. i sensed it coming but it was just as epic as i hoped. i felt less chemistry between mare and cal in this book (even though i'm #teammaven i still loved cal in the first) and while i could be dead wrong, here is what i think: 
 victoria is setting us up for a warner-esque (of tahereh mafi's shatter me) love story between mare and maven. i know it makes no sense -he committed countless unexcusable crimes (a la darkling and warner)- but do we know for sure that was him? do we really? did we see him actually hurt anyone in this book? no. okay, well technically, he did hurt mare with that branding thing but.... gah. i just feel like there is some sort of explanation. maybe somehow it protects her? i dunno. i just know there is more to the story. and all of the bad things that did happen, cersei -excuse me, elara, was still alive and well. and do we know why she was in the prison? do we really understand what was happening during that prison break out? why was her hair graying and her appearance worn? i tell you why: because there is more to this whole ""maven is evil"" business than meets the eye. i am getting very strong juliette (of shatter me) vibes where mare is going to start to understand or find out more about maven in the next book and help him struggle to redeem himself by the end of the series. i am wishing for a hea between m&m but most likely i think she will help save him from himself and end up with cal or alone. maven is not pure evil and i don't think he is the villain the way we think he is. i think there are other factors at play that will be revealed -like how we thought warner was pure evil in shatter me only to find his actions explained away in the sequels. 
 ""no one is born a monster."" but i wish some people were. it would make it easier to hate them, to kill them, to forget their dead faces. ""even maven."" i'm sorry but quotes like that hint at my suspicions so well. shades of gray, people, shades of gray. 
 >>now maybe you can think this is just wishful thinking. your reaction to my prediction is probably this: 
 and you can throw a hundred things maven did in my face and tell me i can't explain all of that away. 
 there are people who read shatter me who refused to forgive warner. i realize rooting for maven is crazy to a rational eye, but in books i tend to love and sympathize with the villain and i'm sorry but reading that ending where mare has given herself over to maven in exchange for everyone's freedom... i just know there is so much potential there. 
 maybe i'm wrong and he really is a psychopath. but i got chills with that ending and it was because of what we might see in the next book. i'm sorry but i'm just not getting an epic love story for cal & mare, i think she is going to fall for maven & try to save him from himself in the next two books. i could be dead wrong and i realize i sound crazy, but i'm telling you, i think there is more to maven than the villain victoria has been leading us to believe. she's a master at twists and i am telling you that i think maven is her trump card. i think maven is end game for this series and i do not think he is pure evil even though we've only been offered evidence of the contrary. i'm calling it and if i'm wrong, well maybe i am, but my author instincts are telling me there is more than black and white, evil and good. this series is going to be about shades of gray. 
 final notes: why oh why did i have to wait a whole book to get two scenes with maven? i know why. because victoria is an evil genius and knows she is torturing us but it's exactly what we need to get amped up for the third book (there's four planned now, right?). glass sword did have second-book syndrome -it was building to future events and showing us character development and it was absolutely getting us to see how this world truly functioned, but it was truly necessary for the stage victoria is planning to set. we all saw what she was capable in red queen, and i have faith the next two books will be a non-stop rollercoaster of madness now that she has given us all the building blocks and endeared us to all of the characters (i see what you did there!) so that she can let blood fly in the next. did i love this book more than red queen? no. but i think victoria did an excellent job preparing us for what's to come and building the world none of us really got to see in the first book. this book was fantastic! a thrilling survival story with a hearty dose of humor. the main character mark was such a smartass and i loved it. the voice and the premise hooked me in right away and kept me thoroughly engaged the whole time. my only real issues were that some of the minor characters didn't really stand out as much as they could've, and some of the science heavy bits were a little hard to follow and felt info-dumpy at times. but the human aspect--the heart of the story--was totally on point, and for the most part i just had a great time reading this! 
 overall, this book was exciting and fun and oh man, am i excited for the movie! i would definitely recommend this to anyone who likes survival stories or funny thrillers or sci-fi with an emphasis on the sci! wow. just wow. sarah has done it again! this book was amazing! the romance was borderline new adult which i loved but it was also greatly paced. the plot was so well thought out and executed as well. i highly recommend a court of thorns and roses! eta: i just did my final, final read-through of this book, and i have to say, it was a messy road, and a long revision, but i am really freaking proud of the result. 
 eta: it has a cover!! 
 sin city plus romeo and juliet minus romance plus monsters. 
 this is the strangest book i've ever written. i love it. 
 it's the story of two teens in a broken world, where violent acts breed actual monsters. some are shadows with teeth that feed on flesh and bone. some are corpses that feed on blood. and some can pass for human. those feed on souls. 
 it's the story of kate harker, the only daughter of a crime boss, and august flynn, the son of a man trying to hold his city together. she's a human who wants to be a monster, and he's a monster who wishes he were human. 
 it's dark, and violent, and existential, and the whole thing was inspired by a line from vicious: 
 ""plenty of humans were monstrous, and plenty of monsters knew how to play at being human."" 
 8.3.15: edited to add: and the official title is...this savage song. why song? 
 remember when i said that august was a monster? he's not just any kind of monster, but one of only three soul-eaters in the city. and these rare creatures (he wouldn't like that word) use music to bring the souls of their prey to surface. 
 but it's more than that. this book isn't a solo. it's a duet. a song played by two very different teens trying to survive a very broken world. there are moments of discord, and a few of harmony, and through it all, they have to keep the melody alive. bwahahaha ahh so good! rick does it again! suffice to say, apollo, you are awesome. this book made me literally ""lol"" multiple times and brought a smile to my face seeing old characters i love again. yay! 
 ill be uploading my review to my youtube channel this week! wow that was a great ending to this very fantastical series! i cannot wait to go into more detail in my series review which will be out probably next week. i'll be covering my opinions on all 5 books and then my overall opinion of the series. i am so happy i finally read pjo! this was a ""dam"" good series (lol get it? ""dam"") ok finally i can talk about this book. 
 before i get into it i want to say i learned a big lesson when it comes to sponsored reviews. i was approached to do a sponsored review of this book and at the time my only thoughts were ""hell yeah"" 
 i was planning on reading the book anyways so why not be paid. the contract i had to sign seemed pretty simple, don't spoil things in the book and don't give the book to anyone. then i read the book. i contacted harper letting them know that my review would not be favorable and i would be raising concerns i had over what i viewed as racist stereotypes. then i heard nothing back....for weeks. until about 3 weeks later i got an email saying my sponsorship had been dissolved and that per my contract i could not talk about the book until it's release. which is now, so you better believe i have thoughts. 
 *i want to make a note here because some people are confused. this was not standard practice for a sponsored review. i have never seen or heard of a publisher dissolving a partnership with a booktuber because they didn't like the review. which is why i am still very shocked this happened.* 
 but now instead of telling you why this book is racist, as there are better voices, i will direct you to justina ireland who has spoken out about this book - 
 http://justinaireland.com/dammit-this... 
 what i want to address is the ableism. recently veronica roth did an interview with npr where they discussed how the current gifts in ctm were inspired by chronic pain. the interviewer says that chronic pain can be a gift, to which roth agrees and goes on to say that part of the book is cyra figuring out why her and others are worthy of pain. 
 http://www.npr.org/templates/transcri... 
 * note that roth has said she herself has chronic pain* 
 this to me was so upsetting. i have lived with chronic pain now for 7 years. it is something that has taken over my life and caused a lot of harm. some days it is so bad i can barely sit up, let alone get out of bed. and to see someone equate it with a gift or say people are worthy of it makes me feel sick. whether or not roth has chronic pain herself, i am not one to say she is lying, that does not take away the harm. it is not a magical shield to be pulled out when you've hurt people. 
 twitter threads re: chronic pain 
 https://twitter.com/heatherezell/stat... 
 https://twitter.com/sharpegirl/status... 
 at this point i don't even care to do a real review of this book. i want to put it behind me and never touch on it again. i think the most interesting thing that will come of this series might be a new word. a word readers will forever use to describe a series, that while compelling and wonderful at it's inception, faltered under the weight of an irrational author. you can say: the author harrised the series. (or, ""the book was harrised,"" would be acceptable too...) 
 it is with great sadness i have to report, history did prove the predictor of fate, and the three preceding books delineated into the final wet slap on the pavement. another of harris' literary turds was birthed. but ts eliot was not right, the sookie stackhouse universe did not end with a whimper: it was an apathetic shrug. 
 there are spoilers ahead, many, many, spoilers. 
 i know there are forensic psychologists, and forensic accountants, and forensic anthropologists, and -- well -- it goes on and on. are there forensic editors? or would it be a forensic novelist? maybe we need just a plain 'ol detective? because i don't know how you go from writing a great paranormal romance, beloved by millions, to this piece of crap novel. there has to be some covert, publishing house, hbo royalties, amazon agreement, kind of reason, to make any logical sense of this book... 
 i just can't understand why she ended it the way she did! this is pulp fiction. not marquez. not franzen. hell, it's not even george r r martin. am i crazy? there is a social contract between the readers/buyers of romance novels and the novelists who write them. it's this: the girl ends up with the guy about whom and for which legions of fans have been pining. it's the reason we pick up romance novels in the first place. we want to read about a coupling so intense, it speaks to a deep place inside of us, an atavistic need to be consumed by lust, passion and love. that is the social contract. ....so why at the end of this pulp romance series did i feel like i was reading the white hotel? it. was. awkward. (...and creepy. just to warn you, there is a sex scene. it's bad. like - we should report it to the school's psychologist - bad...) 
 i mean, i see how ms. harris painted herself into a corner with sookie and eric, but that's the beauty of fiction, especially pulp fiction -- you can paint yourself right out. there's no shame in it, because -- we already know it's crap fiction. but it's fun crap fiction, so it's okay, there's no judgement... here watch me do it! 
 ""oh hey sookie, it's me, niall, i'm back. i heard that you used that magic fairy thing i gave you in a selfless act. so guess what? here's another. because you're so cute. and blonde. now you can wish that all vampires revert back to their human state."" (which, by the way, would have been the kindest thing for which any person could have wished.) ""oh really, great grand daddy, thanks, now eric's not shooting blanks and we can make many, many babies together. and we can watch a bunch of thousand year old people try to revert back into their humanity. which would have been way more interesting than reading about me and sam going fucking line dancing!"" 
 as for a review: here goes. it's another bad story. very thin plot with so many holes. there is a whole villain in this novel that goes totally unrevealed. literally harris forgets about him (remember the devil - that wasn't claude, right?). um... there are a lot of casseroles - again. poor fashion choices. a lot of goodbyes, i guess, harris is using this book to say a final goodbye to all of these characters. so for that reason there are a lot of scenes that do nothing to advance the thread of a story. there is some other stuff, but...it...was...too boring to remember. 
 if you want my advice on whether or not to read it, i say do. i mean if you read the first 12, you should finish what you started and finish the series. a least you can accomplish something that the author couldn't....but borrow the book. so good. 
 so freaking good. 
 not just good but great. 
 gahhhhhhhhh 
 p.e.r.f.e.c.t.i.o.n 
 i read queen of shadows back in june but could not say anything about it (not even that i had it!). but now i can and let me tell you, sarah has done it again! i loved qos, so beautiful, bloody and outstanding. oh and...rowan...swoon!!! 
 5/5 stars of course! i got a chance to read an early version of this a little while ago. needless to say, i jumped at it. 
 the reason for this is that so far, i haven't read a book by brandon sanderson that i haven't loved. that means it's quite likely that i'll get a chance to read another good book, which is always welcome. 
 or i'll finally read something of sanderson's i *don't* like. which would thrill me, honestly. 
 why? well, because brandon writes so much faster than me. it only seems fair that some of his stuff should be crap. it just doesn't seem fair that he's brilliant and fast.... 
 unfortunately for my ego, steelheart is another win for sanderson, proving that he's not a brilliant writer of epic fantasy, he's simply a brilliant writer. period. 
 simply said. great book. tight writing. nice take on superheroes. nice world creation. absolutely worth your time. no stars. 
 disclaimer: i read to about 65%. skim read to about 90% and read to the end. also, this review will contain spoilers for the alternate ending that are not in spoiler tags. 
 years ago, when twilight was in its prime, someone told me that breaking dawn was never supposed to happen. that it was the book where stephenie meyer was given free reign to do whatever she wanted because the series was so popular, everyone would buy it regardless of quality, and rake in big dough-cheese for her and her publishers. i don't really know how true that assumption is, but dammit if isn't true for life and death. 
 take me for example: i own all of the twilight books, have read twilight (just the first book) a total of 4 times, 5 if you include this (and i do), written about some of the good that came of the series (i'm not always a fire-breathing bitch queen), made fun of it, enjoyed parts of it, loathed chucks of it and everything else in between. i also attempted to re-read the series back in 2012 for this little thing i started called project: hindsight, and had so much fun reviewing midnight sun (i really wish she'd finish that), but by the time i got to new moon (the book i dislike the most), i just couldn't continue on and abandoned the project. 
 over the past few years, i've settled on generally disliking everything twilight stands for while holding onto a morbid fascination and, begrudgingly, bestowing some sort of respect for a series that put ya literature on the map. 
 so when i heard of life and death, literally the day it released, i knew i'd buy it. no questions asked. i was hoping many of the issues i had with twilight would be corrected with this version. it had so much potential to be great! i never expected there to be huge drastic changes to the story -- i did expect it to be pretty much the same as twilight, so believe me when i say that was the least of its problems. 
 i won't bother reviewing this book, because it's essentially the same as twilight and i've already written a review for that. just swap around the pronouns in your head as you read it. 
 in the forward, stephenie meyer opens with this: 
 ""but i've always maintained that it would have made no difference if the human were male and the vampire female-- it's still the same story. gender and species aside, twilight has always been a story about the magic and obsession and frenzy of first love."" 
 i don't think she was very successful. there were times when i wondered what meyer was truly trying to accomplish here. was she trying to basically say her novel features an unhealthy relationship even with roles reversed? as in, ""hey guys, my book is horrible either way!"" or was her goal to further highlight how twilight had a lot of instances of sexism, including sexual violence against women? because if so, then i suppose, yeah, she was successful. 
 here's a general run down: beau is your classic gary stu who falls for the ultimate manic pixie dream girl, edythe. he has no aspirations to do or be anything until he spots the love of his life in his high school cafeteria. not much has changed with our young, desperate lovers except for their pronouns, but edythe is still a jerk/control freak/stalker and somehow less creepy than edward. and beau is still a very weak character and as interesting as the dirt beneath my shoe. there is an alternate ending which is essentially a pathetic attempt to pack new moon and eclipse into a clusterfuck of info-dumping. but more on that later. 
 what i really want to talk about is the treatment of the female characters. 
 i don't know how this was even possible, but reading life and death actually made me hate twilight even more than i originally did. this is mostly because it became shockingly evident that certain scenes (sexual assault) were purposefully left out in this version because the characters didn't have vaginas. lovely. 
 bella's attempted rape scene has now turned into beau's assault scene. if you remember, in twilight, while bella is getting lost in port angeles, she runs into a group of drunk men who attempt to sexually assault her. this is made clear by their jeers (""don't be like that, sugar."") and edward's later dialogue. but for beau, his assailants are a mix between female and male and have the intention of beating him up because they think he is a cop. the section is entirely re-written with more dialogue, a gun and threats of death. 
 then there is rosalie's rape scene, now changed to royal's assault scene. instead of royal being raped, he's tricked during the wedding and beat up within an inch of his life. now, one could argue the time period and say, ""well, that's happened back then. it's just how things were."" and, maybe, before i read life and death i could have seen that point. but when the two biggest instances of female sexual assault are completely left out when you swap the genders, oy, that's an issue. 
 now that is not to say i wanted to see men get rape in life and death. it's just a glaring problem where i now see those scenes as ""literary rape,"" used as plot devices to add depth and sympathy to rosalie's character, and to give edward a reason to look super heroic in the face of rapists. maggie stiefvater said it best in this is a post about literary rape: 
 ""i'm talking about novels where the rape scene could just as easily be any other sort of violent scene and it only becomes about sex because there's a woman involved. if the genders were swapped, a rape scene wouldn't have happened. the author would've come up with a different sort of scenario/ backstory/ defining moment for a male character."" 
 that is exactly what happened here. 
 one could argue that meyer wrote a more progressive version of twilight with life and death and that's partly true to an extent. edythe does appear to try to make her relationship with beau as equal as possible. but there are constant references to the gender changes as if meyer is trying to prove something to the reader, and they only seemed to further resign me to the fact that meyer has no idea what she's doing. (bold is mine.) 
 his straight gold hair was wound into a bun on the back of his head, but there was nothing feminine about it-- somehow it made him look even more like a man. 
 i fumbled for my wallet. 
 ""um, let me-- you didn't even get anything--"" 
 ""my treat, beau."" ""but--"" 
 ""try not to get caught up in antiquated gender roles."" 
 she turned toward the cafeteria, swinging her bag into place. 
 ""hey, let me get that for you,"" i offered. 
 she looked up at me with doe eyes. ""does it look too heavy for me?"" 
 ""well, i mean..."" 
 ""sure,"" she said. she slid the bag down her arm and then held it out to me, very deliberately using just the tip of her pinkie finger. 
 it was like meyer was shouting me, ""do i impress you?!"" and i kept going: 
 in the hands of a more skilled writer, this might have been pulled off flawlessly. i found the changes she made with beau's narration interesting. meyer mentioned in the forward that bella is more flowery with her words, where beau is not. this is a complete understatement. the one thing twilight actually had going for it, was the occasionally pretty quote. i say occasional, because the novel contains too many short, simple sentences than i usually like in my books. in life and death's case, the writing has been watered down so much that it feels on par with see spot run. and i don't necessarily think this is a gender thing. just because a character is a boy, doesn't mean he can't be articulate or well-versed. 
 ""bonnie, there's something you didn't know about me.... i used to smell really good to vampires."" 
 corny. so very corny. 
 it's not uncommon to discover popular ya authors' inability to write convincing male povs. *cough*veronica roth*cough* and i learned from midnight sun, that it's not exactly meyer's forte either, but c'mon! this was really bad, even for her. 
 the there's beau's obsession with edythe's unhealthy* body. oh, god, i'm so disgusted with this part, and i don't really understand why it was included. 
 ""her pale arms, her slim shoulders, the fragile-looking twigs of her collarbones, the vulnerable hollows above them, the swanlike column of her neck, the gentle swell of her breasts-- don't stare, don't stare-- and the ribs i could nearly count under the thin cotton. she was too perfect, i realized with a crushing wave of despair. there was no way this goddess could ever belong with me."" 
 is this supposed to show beau's unrealistic expectations of women's bodies? that only vampires can achieve this level of ""perfection"" that society constantly forces on us? because there is no other explanation that works well here and i'm really trying to give meyer the benefit of the doubt and throw her a bone. the issue with this theory is, there's no indication in the book that this is an unrealistic view. actually quite the opposite happens later in that same scene: 
 i had a new definition of beauty. 
 sigh. i don't think i need to go into why this is problematic, so i'll just leave that there for your critique. 
 *unhealthy, as in for majority of women, this is an unattainable beauty standard. apologies if that came off as body shaming women/girls where that is their healthy. i'm speaking specifically about society's constant pressure on women and girls to be as thin as possible, many times to the detriment of their physical and emotional health. when beau describes edythe, he focuses so heavily on the sharp angles of her bones and it perpetuates the idea that these characteristics make her more beautiful than others. i find these descriptions irresponsible and feel there could have been a better way to describe her. 
 so let's talk about the ending. this part will have spoilers beyond this point. this is your one and only warning. 
 yes, it's re-written -- horribly, if i'm being honest. during the scene with the ballet studio (which, btw, beau didn't take ballet as a kid because he's a boy. *eyeroll*), everything is pretty much similar expect for the fact that edythe can't suck out all the venom out of beau's body, leaving him only one possible future: becoming a vampire super early and living happily ever after with his bae, edythe. 
 i wouldn't have had an issue with the change if it had actually been written without the massive amounts of info-dumping. it reads like meyer decided last minute that she wanted to only do 2 chapters of the gender swap (which she mentions in the forward), realized she spent all of her deadline time on re-writing the entire book, and quickly wrote an ending hours before she emailed it to her editor. 
 she crams the werewolf history, volturi history, rules of being a vampire, and beau's human funeral altogether and it's just so goddamn messy. it also makes the insta-love look even worse because at least bella had 3 other books and a pining jacob to consider leaving edward. it was just an overall hot ass mess that seemed so out of place. this is why i said they just let meyer do whatever the hell she wants; half that stuff would have never flown with a debut novel or any novel that desired to actually be, you know, good. 
 would i recommend this and should you read it? hard to say. my first response is, ""oh, god, no. don't waste your money."" $12.99 is an unacceptable price for an ebook (thank goodness for kindle returns!). it doesn't really offer anything vital to the twilight fandom/universe and is generally a horrible piece of writing that i want to fling stones at. but then the other half of me enjoys the suffering of my fellow book lovers and is considering purchasing this as a gag joke to both of my lovely co-bloggers. because that's really all this trite, wish-fulfilling, wankfest of a re-imaginging is good for, and i really, really need to stop being so damn curious about everything. but anyway, i'm rambling when all i really want to say is... the ball's in your court now, e.l. james. i eagerly await your newest, fan fiction original book. do you remember that taylor swift song about romeo and juliet, love story? 
 it's lyrics go something like this: 
 i'm a pretty little girl who knows nothing about literature 
 so i sing a song about starcrossed lovers 
 whose only problem is that daddy doesn't approve 
 but it's all good because we get married anyway. 
 just like that cliffnote's story about romeo and juliet! 
 yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeyyyyy! 
 we have a tendency with ya literature today, to have stories with the super duper happiest of happy endings where everything works out and true love's only real complications are external difficulties, and self-esteem issues for the girl. 
 i'm trying to think of the perfect example here and because this review is full of cheap shots at easy targets i'm going to go with... 
 twilight! 
 come on down, bella and edward! 
 now, don't get me wrong. there's nothing wrong with happy endings and butterflies and rainbows and kittens. they're lovely, lovely things and in the hands of an accomplished author, they do well. there's also nothing wrong with having a relationship that's troubled by only external forces. once again, in the right hands it's fine. i'm not being a miserly old grinch here. okay, maybe a little bit, but moving on! 
 the problem is that in real life, relationships are usually impacted by internal factors. so when you base your story on perfection that can only be tainted by evil people trying to destroy your true love, and twist the story to finally reach that happily ever after, then what you sacrifice is often the very real, almost-tangible, relatable emotions that a more realistic, thoughtful storyline could bring. 
 and also, romeo and juliet is a tragedy, taylor swift. 
 thank you, kieran culkan. you're a fresh breeze amongst the stagnant world of apathetic performers. 
 now what i love about laini taylor, other than everything, is that this woman is made of fairytales. i swear she's like woven together by sweet kisses and dewdrops. she's been sung into being by blind minstrels bathed in moonlight. she's wrapped in gossamer and shrived in pure white swan feathers. you know, all that magical shit. she's that. the woman is magic and she writes magic. if anyone could take romeo and juliet, mate it with a ya paranormal romance and produce a love child that people don't want to drown at birth - then it would be laini taylor. 
 this book is powerful, emotive, heart breaking, anguishing! 
 what i'm saying...the point i'm trying to make here...the truth is... laini taylor kicked my heart in the ass. 
 and i liked it! 
 this review can also be found on my blog, cuddlebuggery book blog. love the writing, love the world, love these characters. the ending hurt my soul but fortunately i have book 3 to jump into immediately. so allie is an orphaned teenager in a dystopian fantasy where people are enslaved by vampire masters. then she gets turned into a vampire and struggles with the morality of being a monster. 
 so at first i was like. 
 but then she was like. 
 a comparable representation on the scale of awesomeness - not a literal depiction. 
 and then i was like. 
 right away from the beginning of the novel allie was pretty ass kicking. 
 and then kanin the vampire showed up and i was like. 
 yeah, sure. whatevs. 
 but then he was like. 
 and then i was like. 
 so then allie goes trekking through the woods and i'm like. 
 and then she meets up zeke and i was like. 
 then zeke is like ewwww vampires suck and i was like. 
 then stuff with them happened and i was like. 
 so then i was worried about the writing since i'd been on the fence about the iron fey. but then kagawa did a lot of: 
 and i was like. 
 and then stephanie said the plot was slow, and i was like. 
 and then i got to the end and allie was like. 
 so i was like. 
 this review also appears on our blog, cuddlebuggery i feel empowered by that book, especially the fight scenes. so ba! 4.5 solid i've read this book many different times in many different ways. 
 i read it off the page when it first came out. later, i listened to gaiman's narration of the audiobook when i was sequestered in the north woods of wisconsin in a desperate attempt to finish book two. i watched the movie and enjoyed it. 
 my most recent experience of the book was listening to it with my little boy on a long car ride. i wasn't sure he'd be able to get into it. not because of the vocabulary. he's very sharp for being 4.5. he's good with words. but sometimes he gets a little scared. 
 despite my worries, he seemed to enjoy it. he paid attention, attention, asking for us to turn it back on after we stopped by the side of the road. a day later, he excitedly told me all about the story, apparently forgetting i'd been in the car too. 
 all of that was months ago. fast forward to now.... 
 * * * 
 ""dad,"" oot said. ""do you know the guy who wrote coraline?"" 
 the question caught me by surprise. the two of us were driving to a party together, a friend was having a bonfire and i was amazed that he was thinking about anything other than smores. 
 ""i do,"" i said. ""his name is neil gaiman."" 
 ""do you have his phone number?"" he asked. 
 ""no,"" i said. 
 ""do you know where he lives?"" 
 ""i do,"" i said. 
 ""are you his friend?"" 
 that brought me up short. for oot, that's a simple question. if you meet someone and play with them, they're you're friend. easy. 
 for adults these things are harder. and it's doubly hard for me these days. my life has changed so much over the last five years, and my previously established metric for friendship doesn't work very well any more. 
 you see, for the majority of my life, a friend was someone who would, say, help me move a couch. someone you could bum 10 dollars off of if you needed to. a friend was someone who felt comfortable enough to come over to my house without calling first. then, if i wasn't home, they would let themselves in, eat out of my fridge, and start watching tv. 
 while i'm terribly fond of him, neil gaiman has never done any of these things. 
 then again, neither have any of the other authors i've met over the last few years. i'm painfully aware of the need for new friendship metrics, but i haven't managed to develop a good set yet. 
 that won't make any sense to my boy, but still, i try to be honest with him whenever i can. ""i don't know if we're friends,"" i say. ""but we're colleagues."" 
 ""what's a colleagues?"" he asks, right on cue. 
 ""that means we know each other and do the same job,"" i explain. 
 ""oh yes,"" he says. ""you're both authors."" 
 it makes me proud when he says that. i'm proud that my boy knows i write books. 
 ""do you know his address?"" oot asks, and it takes me a while to realize that he's returning to his previous line of questioning. 
 ""i do,"" i said, not bothering to point out that knowing where someone lives and knowing their address is pretty much the same thing. 
 ""can you send him a letter?"" 
 ""i could,"" i say. 
 oot pauses for a moment then, and i realize that this has been the point of the whole conversation. he wants to send neil gaiman a message. 
 ""what would you like me to write to him?"" i ask. 
 ""you should tell him he *sure* knows how to write a scary story...."" 
 * * * 
 so there you go. you don't really need me to tell you how i feel about one of gaiman's books at this point. you know i love his writing. 
 instead, i'm offering up my boy's unvarnished opinion. did he think the story was scary? absolutely. but he still wanted us to turn it back on as soon as we were back in the car. 
 what's more, he was still thinking about coraline months later. and it was the first book where he's ever shown any interest in contacting the author. 
 so. bravo, neil gaiman. you've managed to win over two generations of the rothfuss household. what does [that lady] see when she looks in the mirror? kelsea wondered. how could a woman who looked so old still place so much importance on being attractive? kelsea saw now that there was something far worse than being ugly: being ugly and thinking you were beautiful. 
 because how dare anyone ugly have confidence in themselves. 
 when i die, i want inscribed on my gravestone ""she read the queen of the tearling."" call me unambitious, but that shall be counted among my proudest accomplishments, because never have i ever read a more painfully long, worthless book. 
 the copywriter who wrote this book's summary compares it to the hunger games and game of thrones; they have clearly read neither. they compared to the world-building to that of the hunger games. they compared the characters to that of game of thrones. 
 are you fucking kidding me? 
 a thousand monkeys typing on a thousand typewriters could write a book that is more similar to those works than anything this book has to offer. 
 this was also the most intensely painful reading experience i have ever had due to the sheer length of the book, aggravated by the fact that the book just dragged on and on and on without a point. this is the book that doesn't end. a good 30% of the book is devoted to traveling. not since the hobbit have i been so fucking bored out of my mind. bilbo baggins could have gone there and back again, and then make another round around middle earth, and sure, why not---take a few years to flutter around rivendell chilling with the elves in the time it took this book to go anywhere. 
 the summary: kelsea raleigh is the new queen of the tearling. her mother, the late queen elyssa has died, and it is time for kelsea to claim the throne. she travels to the new kingdom. she's traveling. she's on a horse. they're slowly making their way to the castle. slooooooooowly. 
 meanwhile, the red queen of mortmesne is wonder where the fuck kelsea is. she's spent the last 19 years searching for her. seriously, where the fuck is the girl? oh, well, the red queen will think about that later. time to fuck some slaves! oh yeah. give it to me, baby. 
 kelsea's still traveling. man, her new guards are really, really good looking. oh, shit, she's kidnapped. but not really, because the kidnappers pretty much let kelsea wander free. 
 oh, whew. she's free. back to traveling! whooo! oh yay, we're at the castle. kelsea makes some fucking stupid decisions and pretty much dooms her country within hours of reaching her new castle. 
 meanwhile, javel, the guard, is telling his story, his sad story of how his wife was lost to him. 
 kelsea's throned queen! yay! she spends a lot of time talking to her advisors. she almost gets killed (several times). 
 meanwhile, the priest, father tyler, is really, really upset at how his life gets flipped turned upside down. 
 the red queen of montmesne is fucking more slaves. where is that dratted kelsea. 
 kelsea thinks she is very plain. she should go on a diet. but no, she shouldn't, because she's plain anyway, and who cares about appearances, anyway. man, kelsea wishes she were pretty. as pretty as her maidservant, the one whose beauty is so valued that she got enslaved and raped for it. 
 meanwhile, javel is still doing shit. talking to people. getting roped into some random-ass plans. 
 father tyler is still moping around. 
 the red queen's pissed off. that fucking kelsea. why does she keep eluding my grasp. and by grasp, the red queen means her minion's grasps, since the red queen is just too important to do anything about hunting kelsea herself. magic, pfft. ugh, whatever. let's get ourselves a 7-year old little boy and bleep him in the bleep bleep. that is so not legal. 
 javel's still talking somehow. 
 kelsea's still talking to people. it sure would be nice if she were pretty. but really, kelsea doesn't have time to think about that right now. there are more important things at hand. like insulting a woman in front of the royal court. 
 fuck, they're traveling again?! 
 the end. 
 765. mother. fucking. pages. 
 the setting: it doesn't make any motherfucking sense. i started this book thinking it was a medieval fantasy. it wasn't. it has an old-world feel. it's not. women are in long dresses. we are riding horses. we're using hawks to hunt. there are kings and queens and magic and castles. what you you mean it's not in the past? what do you mean it's not a fantasy. 
 this is the future? this is a dystopia? we used to be the united states and europe? what the actual fuck? what happened? 
 i seriously do not fucking understand this setting. first off, it is fucking lazy, because the retelling of the history is told by mouth, as a story. 
 ""once upon a time, there was a kingdom called the tearling. it was founded by a man named william tear, a utopian who dreamed of a land of plenty for all. but ironically, the tearling was a kingdom of scarce resources, for the british and americans had not been fortunate in their choice of landing place."" 
 british. american. this is the motherfucking future, people. how the fuck did we get here? and more importantly. where are we? 
 why are all technologies lost? we supposedly got to this place in an event called the crossing. where is this place? are we even on earth? why are there so few survivors? this land is called new europe. we have a town called new london. did it actually pop up out of the ocean? why was the old world destroyed? why did we have to seek refuge in new europe? are we so fucking inconsistent that in all the hundreds of fucking years in which we've settled here that we have lost all the motherfucking techologies of today's time in the future. so much that we don't even have the technology for motherfucking printing presses? we have geneticists. but we don't have the technology to buy books. 
 and why are books rare? because we motherfucking burned them for fuel when we got here. despite the motherfucking forests of oaks that surrounds this new land, they fucking burned books for fuel. 
 that was what had happened to most of the books that originally came over in the british-american crossing: the desperate had burned them for fuel or warmth. 
 there are no doctors. there are, like, 2 doctors in the whole of fucking new london. new civilizations have come up with technology, they've been so much more innovative than this. the medieval ages were more advanced than the tearling, because they don't know how to fucking make gunpowder or cannons. 
 seriously. you expect us to retain absolutely fucking nothing of the knowledge that we have gained for all these years? did you choose the motherfucking dumbest pieces of shits to carry over to the new world? why didn't you choose important people, like scientists, botanists, doctors, instead of a bunch of fucking feeblewitted morons who don't know how to carry over fucking technology from the old world when you crossed over to the new. who fucking burn books for fuel despite being surrounded by trees. 
 fucking dystopian fail. 
 the writing: not since charles dickens have i read such verbosity. there is a reason why this book is so long. it is packed to the brim with the most long-winded, irrelevant description of every fucking thing in the world. 
 introspection? sure. this book has it aplenty. let's describe every single fucking thought that kelsea has ever fucking had in her head. kelsea thinks. a lot. some relevant things. mostly very, very, very idiotic things that make no fucking different whether they were omitted or not. 
 red hair was a recessive gene, and in the three centuries since the crossing, it had bred slowly and steadily out of the population. carlin had told kelsea that some women, and even some men, liked to dye their hair red, since the rare commodity was always valuable. but after about an hour of sneaking looks at the guard, kelsea became certain that she was looking at a true head of red hair. no dye was that good. 
 her dreams? kelsea thinks about them. her opinions about the men? sure, let's have it. kelsea's insecurity? sure, let's have several fucking paragraphs on it. man, her food just tastes fucking terrible tonight. let's describe her thoughts on the venison in excruciating detail. 
 dinner was venison, stringy and only barely edible after roasting over the fire. the deer must have been very old. kelsea had seen only a few birds and squirrels on their ride through the reddick, though the greenery was very lush; there could be no lack of water. kelsea wanted to ask the men about the lack of animals, but she worried that it would be taken as a complaint about the meal. 
 man, it's a motherfucking long journey. after all, the traveling alone takes about 30% of the book. let's just describe every single freaking detail on it. the houses are built with bricks. let's describe the fucking bricks in detail. 
 to the east, kelsea spotted what must be the house of a noble: a high tower made of red brick. real brick! tearling brick was a notoriously poor building material compared to mortmesne's, which was made with better mortar and commanded at least a pound per kilo. carlin had an oven made of real bricks, built for her by barty, and kelsea had wondered more than once whether barty had bought the bricks off the black market from mortmesne. 
 details! details! details! we are fucking drowning in details. the clothes of the noblemen! let's decribe them! one of the ladies wear a hat in the shape of a fish! let's mention that. and while we're at it, let's make fun of her for it! will it ever stop?! 
 the guards: not since monty python and the holy grail have there ever been such irreverent, incompetent fucking royal guards. they are the most fucking pathetic examples of soldiers i have ever fucking encountered. this is kelsea. she is one of the last of her royal line. her life is priceless. she is supposed to be guarded by 9 men. 9 men who are motherfucking blundering assholes because they cannot do anything right. 
 while they are traveling, the men get drunk and sing bawdy songs instead of securing her guard. they are completely fucking shocked that later on in the journey, they are captured. 
 while they are traveling, they are caught again off their guard. kelsea is forced to flee for her life. 
 at the castle, while they are supposed to be watching her back. kelsea gets stabbed---in the back. 
 ...a bolt of pain arrowed all the way down to her toes. 
 stabbed, she thought, dazed. mace didn't cover my back after all. 
 later on, in the bath, kelsea gets cornered by an assassin! she's almost fucking killed again. 
 where are the fucking nitwits guarding her?! 
 guards?! guards?! they are supposed to be subservient. they are supposed to be respectful. they are supposed to be odebient. they are not supposed to talk back to her. oh, sure, they say they're not going to talk back to her. 
 he stared at her without expression. ""i say nothing, lady. that's why i'm a queen's guard."" 
 but words mean fucking nothing. because whatever mace (real name lazarus, head of kelsea's guard) is, it's not fucking subservient. he talks down to her, as if she were an incompetent little girl (well, she is, but she is still the fucking queen). he talks back to her. he disagrees with her. when she's gravely injured, mace nudges her by poking at her with his foot. is this the behavior of a guard towards his queen? i don't think so. 
 mace's boot landed in the small of her back, and kelsea bit her tongue against a scream. 
 kelsea: incompetent nitwit. a heroine who is so astoundingly stupid and unprepared by her fucking mentors that she is unworthy of governing anything but a toy kingdom made of legos. 
 i hope kelsea steps on the pieces. i hope they hurt badly. i hope our aspiring queen is in pain for the torment and the headache and the hangover i experienced while reading this book about one of the most insipid heroine to ever litter the precious pages of a book. 
 she constantly complains about how plain she is. 
 but her face was as round and ruddy as a tomato, and--there was no other word for it--plain. 
 she has the most fucking idiotic thoughts about everything and everything. no subject is too minor for her notice. the rug? oh, it's probably made of deer hide. spare me. 
 she is not a fucking queen. her guardians are incompetent, because she has been so completely fucking sheltered from the world that she doesn't understand anything, but she still knows things. somehow. she has never seen alcohol, yet she knows what alcohol smells like. she knows what alcoholism looks like when she sees it in a man. and she revels in being drunk, cause it's just like in a book, y'all! 
 kelsea woke with an aching head and a parched mouth, but it wasn't until breakfast that she realized it was her first hangover. despite the discomfort, she was charmed to experience something that she'd only read about in a book. an upset stomach was a small price to pay for fiction made real. 
 she cares so much for the fate of her people. kelsea is so incredibly hurt that her people are being sent as slaves to mortmesne---250 a month---that she is willing to renege on the treaty between their countries. within hours of her arrival to the capital, kelsea makes a heroic gesture that completely endangers the peace of two nations. she stops the shipment of slaves. she was warned. she didn't listen. she risks the lives of the entire nation for the sake of a few. 
 ""lady, the mort treaty is specific. there is no appeals process, no outside arbiter. if a single shipment fails to arrive in demesne on time, the mort queen has the right to invade this country and wreak terror. i lived through the last mort invasion, lady, and i assure you, mhurn wasn't exaggerating the carnage. before you take action, consider the consequences."" 
 despite being plain, kelsea is terribly judgmental of looks. she criticizes an old, ugly woman for daring to look beautiful. she is envious of another woman's beauty, despite the fact that that woman's beauty got her raped. 
 kelsea complains a lot about the extravagances at court. the pointless waste of money. so much that she is willing to waste her valuable men's time and her own resources into traveling 2 weeks to get her books from her old home. and right away. it must be done right away. 
 the fetch: a criminal. the projected love interest. a robin hood? not quite. you see, robin hood steals from the rich and actually distributes it to the poor. the fetch? nah. 
 ""well, he's a hero to the common people, lady. every piece of rich man's fortune lost endears him to the poor."" 
 ""does he distribute the money to the poor?"" 
 ""no, lady."" 
 so, um. exactly how is he the hero of the common people? 
 naturally, she should turn him in. kelsea is the queen, she should set an example to her people. put criminals where they belong. 
 or not. 
 kelsea took a deep breath. ""i wouldn't betray him for any number of pounds."" 
 ""ah, christ."" 
 emma, emma watson. i heard that you have signed up for this project. i adore you. you are brilliant. you are gorgeous. you are a goddess, and you have won my heart ever since you stepped onto the screens of harry potter, with your disapproving frown and your frizzy hair, far more beautiful than hermione watson could ever be. but i adored you then, i love you now, and i hope for your sake that the movie adaptation exceeds every aspect of the book, because the book itself has almost no substance to offer. 
 i can't even hate this book because it tries so hard. it is the equivalent of having your 6-year old niece draw a picture of you. sure, you look like a motherfucking moose with butterfly wings for some fucking reason, but hey, it's an a for effort, right? 
 quotes were taken from an uncorrected galley proof subject to change in the final edition. ""good gracious!"" said alice, ""i do believe i'm inside a review!"" 
 she turned to the hatter and the march hare. 
 ""well, let me see. here is the title, and here is the date i read it. that must be today. now i need to explain the plot and the overall point."" 
 ""there is no plot,"" said the march hare disagreeably. 
 ""and there is no point,"" agreed the hatter. 
 he poured a little hot tea on the dormouse's nose, making it wake with a start. 
 ""the book breaks new ground,"" it said rapidly in a high, sing-song voice. ""intentionally eluding easy assignment to any traditional category, it anticipates the twentieth century's fascination with the relationship between the signifier and the signified, and wittily deconstructs the primacy of meaning and the rationality of thought."" then it went back to sleep again, and began to snore gently. 
 ""whatever did that mean?"" asked alice, surprised. 
 ""why is a derrida like a derriere?"" replied the hatter. 
 ""i don't know,"" said alice. 
 ""i don't know either,"" said the hatter triumphantly. 
 ""it would be reasonable"", said alice, in the grown-up tone she had sometimes heard her sister use, ""it would be reasonable for you to explain what the book is about, so that i could put that in my review."" 
 ""it would be reasonable,"" said the hatter, ""to expect hot premarital sex in a stephenie meyer novel. but don't imagine you'll find any."" 
 alice couldn't think of anything to reply to this, so she turned away without another word. when she was almost out of earshot, she thought she heard the hatter shout something after her that might have been ""foucault!"" this was just...so unnecessarily wordy and pretentious. i just did not enjoy it at all. which makes me sad because the summary says it's for fans of harry potter, game of thrones, and world of warcraft. aka three of my favorite things. so how did i loathe this so entirely from page one? i don't know. ""it is our choices, harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities."" chills. 
 (reread) 
 okay duh 5/5 stars. i actually liked this book more than i remembered! this used to be my least favorite of the harry potter books and, while that still might be true, i was more entertained than i expected! i always forget how different book ginny is from movie ginny (way better all around) and how she has such a bigger role in the books than the films. 
 now onto hp and the prisoner of azkaban! now with spoilery rant @ bottom! 
 hush, hush is the story of nora grey, an average high school student going about her business as usual -- until her biology teacher rearranges the class seating and places her next to the dangerous-looking new kid, patch cipriano. nora gets a weird feeling from patch, and things just keep going from bad to worse as nora becomes convinced that she is being stalked, and may even be the target of murderous intentions. add to the list nora's strange feelings about the archangel ride at the amusement park and her constant near death experiences, and well, nora's life is becoming anything but average. 
 when i finished reading hush, hush, i had to mull it over for awhile. i really wasn't sure what to say. i am absolutely enthralled by the cover (athletic looking, darkly mysterious fallen angel, contorted in mid-air in grayscale? what's not to like?). i had to have it because of that cover*. but i had a sneaking suspicion that a cover that good had to be masking something. yep. it's a bright light to dazzle the eyes and make you *ahem* overlook any faults. 
 it didn't work. 
 inside was the most confused, schizophrenic piece of writing i've read in some time. becca fitzpatrick didn't seem to know quite what she wanted, only that it had to be ominous and scary and dangerous -- and titillating, of course, and mysterious and sexy. so with those buzz words in mind, she threw a bunch of things together and let her narrator, nora, sort them out. nora, understandably, had some trouble with this, and the result is a thoroughly frustrating heroine who jumps to insane conclusions based on inane evidence one moment, and the next goes blithely along into obvious danger. 
 patch is intriguing, and perhaps the most consistent character**, and i was fully prepared for an 'anti-hero as the hero' story. i wanted a little boundary-pushing and a not entirely likeable or trustworthy male lead who may or may not redeem himself, but who gives you the dangerous and alluring in spades. for the most part, patch wasn't a let-down in this regard, and as screwed up as it is to like him, he was the stand-out character for me. (not to say i didn't have issues with him, too.) 
 but it wasn't enough. patch's bad boy antics couldn't save this book from itself. it was self-indulgent, cheesy, melodramatic in the worst sense, and confusing. i wanted to like it; i loved the fallen angel premise, the idea of an anti-hero, and bits and pieces of the writing throughout. but hush, hush suffered from too many villains and too much shock and awe, and not enough thought and follow-through. maybe fitzpatrick can pull it together for round two, and with some strong convincing by trusted, like-minded people, i may be willing to give her another chance (never gonna happen). but this was a monstrous let-down for me. you've been warned.*** 
 *we all know how that whole so-pretty-i-just-had-to thing works out. see my guest post on jo's blog about this. 
 **and by 'consistent' i mean he was consistently a douche. vee was pretty consistent too, and was a lot of fun, but she started to get annoying and a little strange... 
 ***you're still going to read it, aren't you? damn you, james porto and your beautiful, beautiful cover! 
 ***here thar be spoilers*** 
 if you haven't read hush, hush and intend to, or if you don't want me dissing the melodrama that is patch and nora, look away....now! 
 commence rant: 
 you already know i had issues with this book. i think a lot of people are going to take offense to the idea of patch as the hero, as teen girls' fantasy, just as they did with edward in twilight. patch goes beyond the simple term ""bad boy"" in that yes, he does actually mean nora harm. consistently. 
 i'm not going to go into that, because frankly, i don't care. he can be an anti-hero all he wants, whatever. if that's where the story's going, fine. most of my issues -- but not all -- lie with nora. 
 here's the thing: 
 nora is that girl you yell at in the horror movie, the idiot that goes up the stairs instead of out the door, or reaches to turn over the downed bad guy just to make sure. we all know that's frustrating, but we've come to expect it in movies, and that dumb big-breasted, scantily clad girl normally gets killed off. 
 nora is so much more frustrating than that. 
 the many sides of nora: she continually suspects patch (and elliot, and just about everyone else in this story), and with good reason. however, she then continually ignores her instincts and puts herself in danger. in fact, she can't seem to agree with herself. she will think to herself that patch is stalking her and trying to kill her, and then within pages think 'oh, but he could never hurt me.' this just cycles and cycles throughout the story. 
 also throughout the story, nora makes insane jumps in logic -- whether they turn out to be true or not, it's not believable when she immediately jumps to the most bizarre conclusions and then acts on them. at the same time, she will be directly confronted with some piece of real evidence, something that would make a normal, non-fictional person take notice and say something's not right here -- and she will completely ignore it. it's like she's being willfully obtuse. 
 examples: 
 * early(ish) in the story, nora hears a voice in her head and thinks patch has ""breached normal communication methods and could, at will, speak to me without ever opening his mouth."" naturally, she thinks she's delusional. hearing your name and a few inane comments would make one think they are imagining things, and this i could buy. even nora not being exactly sure what happened and being creeped out i could buy. but she proceeds to ask patch how he's able to speak directly to her mind, making her look like a loon. 
 i wouldn't be even all that bothered by this, if it was consistent throughout the story; if nora either consistently thought that she was going crazy because of all the implausible things that are happening, i could buy it; if she wanted to prove she wasn't crazy and kept confronting patch and sleuthing, i could buy it. it would be 1 solid choice on becca fitzpatrick's part. she could be the ultra-paranoid girl who thinks she's going crazy and jumps to conclusions about everything. annoying, but doable. but to present this as if it's normal...and i'm out. 
 * conversely, near the near the end of the story when the shit's really beginning to go down and nearly everyone has become a villain, nora and patch walk out of a movie theater to find that ""...both the tires on the driver's side were flat: '""i can't believe it!"" i said. ""i drove over two nails?""' 
 o_o 
 ??? 
 she thinks she's being stalked, she thinks her best friend has been kidnapped by a teenaged murderer named elliot, and by this point she thinks she's the target of not one but two murderous angels, and yet all she can come up with is that she ran over two nails? come on! if nora will jump to conclusions on the barest of evidence, how in hell does she not comprehend the obvious? 
 * throughout the story, nora thinks everyone's out to get her (she's right, but i'll get to that), especially patch. patch is ominous, capital 'o', and yet...and yet, no matter how much nora thinks he's badbadbad, she trusts him. why? 
 weirdest of all, when nora confronts patch about his intentions, 
 he admits he wanted to kill her 
 ; her reaction? 'i know patch could never hurt me' -- and she trusts him implicitly from that point on. really? the whole story, you've suspected him and been insistent that you should stay away on the barest of evidence, but once he's confessed his (albeit previous) intentions of murder, you trust him. 
 really 
 . her sudden bizarre trust of patch comes too late for any real belief in their romance. or her sanity. 
 there is no consistency in nora's thinking. i just can't understand why becca fitzpatrick couldn't pick one nora to write and stick with her. 
 she could have just always thought she was losing her mind; self-doubt would have been interesting, and made her root-forable. 
 if she had just been reckless and always convinced that yes, maybe something is a little off about patch, but she still found herself attracted to him, it would have been interesting, and could have been used to slowly reveal the truth and up nora's anxiety. 
 if nora had just been naive and always convinced that everything was fine despite any indicators, it would have built tension. 
 but combining it all made nora seem confused and a little off herself, and made the writing seem schizophrenic. 
 too many villains: fitzpatrick makes the rookie mistake of lack of restraint. nora suspects everyone, and everyone does in fact seem to be a villain. this makes the book seem unfocused and sort of cheesy. when everyone is under suspicion, and everyone seems to be a bad guy, it makes it seem like no one really is. it's like if you use a really great word once or twice it's going to stand out. but if every word you use is some great, unusual word, none are going to stand out. there's no negative space, no background to make the focal point pop. everywhere nora turns, someone's trying to kill her. it just gets silly after awhile. also, it has the added negative effect of making it hard for fitzpatrick to ""top"" as it were. where does she go from here? if there are 4 different people trying to kill nora in book 1, how many people will there be out for blood in book 2? she didn't leave any room to grow the suspense. 
 another bad thing about the amount of villains and nora's instant suspicion (and the overall over-the-top nature of the book) was that there was precious little suspense. by giving everything away rather freely, fitzpatrick deprived the reader of the slow build-up and the privilege of the mystery; we never got to have any suspicions of our own, or choose sides. there was too much in the way of ominous overtones, and not enough restraint. 
 on a side note, not that i'm calling vee a villain, but even she became a little weird* as the story went on. it's one thing to be the wild and crazy girl in the best friends dynamic, but constantly trying to get your best friend alone with a guy who she says makes her uncomfortable, who she believes broke into her house and may be stalking her, and who she knows was a murder suspect is reckless beyond the pale, and shitty, shitty friendship. 
 *by which i mean she goes from being quirky and funny to a godawful, shitty friend. you know, for no other reason than apparently to help lure nora into bad/ridiculous situations. plot device: 
 the writing overall: i saw glimpses in fitzpatrick's writing that demonstrated how this could have been a good book. she does sexual tension and confrontation scenes fairly well, and there is some good humor. vee -- in the beginning, at least, before she becomes a really reckless, really bad friend -- was pretty amusing as the traditional sidekick. patch had great one-liners, both funny and smoldering. 
 but for all the occasional good, there was quite a bit in the way of bad. the dialogue was often stilted and weird. the analogies were completely out of left field. they were those turns of phrase that you can tell were used because they sounded cool, or because one was needed, but they don't mean anything, or they leave you thinking wtf? ""his eyes looked like they didn't play by the rules."" what does that even mean? what rules do eyes usually play by? does he not blink? this is a mild example, but i got sick of making note of them. i got this really hit-and-miss feel about the writing and the language in the book. pieces of literary crap mixed in with the really good bits blended to form a ""throw it all in and something's bound to work"" style. a total lack of finesse made it hard to want to keep reading -- and made me feel like if i kept rolling my eyeballs, they were going to roll right out of my head. 
 rant complete. so much yes. falling kingdoms crushed my heart but exceeded all my expectations. so good. if you love high fantasy, do yourself a favor and read this book. another amazing novel by rick riordan! cant wait to start the next novel and see how this all ends! this was so great! i absolutely love the world building--there's a cool magic system and lots of different cities/cultures that have really fascinating dynamics. the ensemble cast of characters is also fantastic! they all have interesting backstories and distinct personalities. writing is great, story is awesome, pacing on point. it wasn't quite perfect, but it was pretty freaking close, and i can't wait for the sequel! 
 if you want a fantasy book with an awesome world, a well developed cast of characters, and an exciting heist storyline--this is definitely the book for you. my video review - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbgmr... 
 this was awesome. it did take me a little bit to really get into it, but once i was in, i was so in. it was so atmospheric, and i was really impressed with the details and the amount of research that had to go into writing this. the time travel aspect was fascinating and just straight up cool, i loved our two main characters and was so happy that we got to see from both of their povs. and that ending! let's just say i'm eagerly anticipating book 2. 
 if you're looking for a cool time travel book, or you love atmospheric stories with rich settings and historical details, or if you just want to read an awesome 'questing through time' type adventure, this is probably the book for you! oh my god a dragon. a terrible dragon who kidnaps a village's beautiful young girls. do they get eaten?! do they get tortured?!!! what is their terrible fate?! 
 ""they forget how to live here...[they] remember to be afraid,"" my father said. that was all. 
 then they took their dowry-silver and left. mostly they would go to kralia and go to the university. often as not they married some city man, and otherwise they became scholars or shopkeepers. 
 are you fucking kidding me? 
 *seethes* 
 i swear to god i'm the only one in the world who didn't think this book is the bestest most specialest wonderfulest book ever. for god's sake, emily may loved it, and i highly respect her opinion, but this book is one case where we will have to agree to disagree. 
 frankly, i have no idea why everyone loved this book and thought it was so wonderful. the main character is every bit of a speshul snowflake mary sue. the ""dragon"" (so very disappointing) is an asshole of the fever sort, the kind i deem jericho-fucking-barrons, a term used to describe an asshole who is an asshole only for the sake of being an asshole. he's grumpy, he's grouchy, he is a huge fucking condescending thundercunt of a douchebag just for the plain old reason that he wants to be one. 
 he was irritated with me every time i came into his library, even on the few days that i managed to keep myself in good order: as though i were coming to annoy and interrupt him, instead of him tormenting and using me. and when he had finished working his magic through me and left me crumpled on the floor, he would scowl down at me and call me useless. 
 let's get one thing straight. i like assholes (sometimes), but they have to have character. for example, dr. house. he is filled with snark. he is a jerk. he's oftentimes despicable, but there's a spark in him, a humanity in him that lets me love him and appreciate him no matter what despicable things that comes out of his mouth, because, under it all (and you seriously have to look deep), he is a human being with a good purpose, no matter how harsh his methods. 
 once again, i like assholes. i like anti-heroes, but they have to self-redeeming. the ""dragon"" in this book is none such. 
 ok, back to the plot. it sucked. i didn't really read the synopsis, but i know there was a dragon who kidnapped girls in it. surely a terrible fate, right?! eeeeeeeeeehhhn. wrong. look at the quote at the beginning of my review. essentially the girls are ""kidnapped"" by said ""dragon"" (keep in mind i used quotation marks around dragon), they're educated, they become well-read, and they want to spread their wings. they're given shit tons of money to make a better life for themselves. 
 terrifying. absolutely fucking terrifying. i'm quivering in my boots. 
 the world building is your standard generic fantasy fare. monsters. kings. princes. but the magic. the fucking magic, man.it just highlights what a special freaking snowflake the main character is. there is nothing to catch the imagination. if i shouted out ""merde!!!!"" and butterflies burst into the air and a rainbow forms at my feet, it would essentially be as magical as the shit in this book. 
 i whispered, ""kalikual."" 
 the power rushed out of me. 
 foreign words!!!! so magical!!!one!1 
 the main character, agnieszka, is seriously nothing new. you have read countless incarnations of her in every shitty ya book ever written because she's a special, special girl who doesn't know how special she is. she's just so ordinary and adorably clumsy and plain, y'all! the dragon always, always takes the most special girl! 
 the dragon didn't always take the prettiest girl, but he always took the most special one, somehow. 
 :| <- this is my surprised face. 
 and ag-noying (my new name for her) is just so...so...ordinary! 
 at seventeen i was still a too-skinny colt of a girl with big feet and tangled dirt-brown hair, and my only gift, if you could call it that, was i would tear or stain or lose anything put on me between the hours of one day. 
 you don't say! 
 but of course, there's more to ag-noying than meets the eye, why, she's got magical power that's just waiting to burst from her like a rose from a fermenting pile of steaming poop. 
 my strength welled up through my body and fountained out of my mouth, and where it left me, a trembling in the air began and went curling down around my body in a spiraling path. 
 yeah, yeah. i've read this shit before, and i say no, thank you. i like my main characters average, thank you very much. i like my ""dragons"" with humanity. 
 1 star is a bit harsh, but for all the hype, this book let me down tremendously. ""you ask how much of it was me,"" he whispers. ""some. enough."" 
 dear mare, stop picking the wrong brother. 
 ***warning, spoilers abound, do not continue with this review unless you have read the book.**** 
 first of all, i called it. i knew that we'd be getting lots of maven and seeing the boy behind the villain's mask in this one. and praise the book gods, i'm so glad victoria didn't let me down. she gave us all those moments we hoped for, the explanation, the moments of fragility, the tension, everything... she gave me a beautiful, tragic, tormented villain who fell in love with the wrong girl. 
 ....i say wrong because mare does not deserve this darkling, this twisted warner of a king. her reaction to his kiss, during the vulnerable tenuous moment between the two was what finally convinced me to give up on their love story (whereas in shatter me you could pick up on something in warner & juliette's kiss, here there's nothing. it's gone, alright, i get the message. mare feels nothing but disgust, it's a ""violation of the worst kind"" -she's in control and she'll never pick the villain). while i have never felt the spark between mare and cal (yup, even in this book including that scene), she's never going to be maven's. that's fine, i'll take him. mare doesn't deserve him, even though maven is more like her than cal will ever be. 
 this is a boy who was crippled from birth by an evil woman so terrible he doesn't know what thoughts are his. i just want him to have a happily ever after. but there is none. this boy is darkness incarnate and i have a feeling he's going to end up doing something noble to save cal or mare or his people in the next (final) book (to redeem himself the only way a villain can) and i just can't cope. 
 the first book is still my favorite, but king's cage gave me so many beautiful twisted lines. victoria is a master of powerful prose, and she delivered some exceptional ones --as you might expect, my favorite ones were his. 
 ""love makes you weak. and she's right. i learned that before i even knew you."" 
 ""i'm not a fool, little lightning girl. if you're going to play in my head, i'm going to play in yours. it's what we're good at."" 
 .... i could try to write a review of this entire book, but let's be honest, i read it for maven and i don't have the heart to write everything up because i'm in mourning for a ship that will never sail. 
 (yes, i realize maven does not have blonde hair but this gif fits perfectly) 
 #teammaven my favorite book in this series so far!! ugh so good. this is why i love fantasy so much. after a recent string of okay fantasy novels, a couple of good ones but nothing to get really excited about, i've rediscovered my passion thanks to this book. i'm so impressed, and so in love, i can't begin to describe it. but i can try to give you a feel for the book, if i can figure out where to start and how to do justice to this masterpiece. 
 kvothe (pronounced like ""quothe"") is a world-renowned figure of mystery with a disreputable reputation - a hero or a demon depending on which stories you hear. the real man has hidden himself away at an inn in the middle of nowhere with his apprentice bast - we know not why - and it's not until the chronicler discovers him there that he shows any interest in reliving his past life. insisting that his story will take three days to tell, and that the famous chronicler must write it down exactly as he tells it, he begins to share his story: a child genius growing up with his parents' troupe, performing plays and tricks across the land while being taught ""sympathy"" (magic), history, chemistry etc. by a tinker, abenthy, who had been to the university; to ending up homeless and penniless on the streets of treban, a big port city. it's not until he's fifteen that he makes it to the university, and is accepted, though he's three years younger than is usual. abenthy has taught him well, and combined with his impressive memory, natural talent, quick intelligence and training, he moves quickly up the ranks of the university. 
 there are many adventures and mishaps along the way, and while some plotlines come to a tidy end at the close of this novel, over-arching plotlines and themes have been given a solid foundation to continue on into the next books. it took a surprisingly long time for me to realise the connection between the number of days he will take to tell his story, and that this is ""day one"" in the trilogy - it's told over the course of the first day. the only thing is, he's young yet (chronicler judges him to be about 25, though at times he looks infintely older), and there are things happening in ""real time"" that intrude upon the story, that will need to be resolved i think - so while i have every confidence rothfuss has excellent control over his creation, i would love more than three books :) 
 i can't think of the last time i was this impressed by any story, let alone a fantasy novel. i won't compare it to bloody george r.r. martin like everyone else is doing because i don't see that they have anything in common, really - one is a work of pure genius and the other is utter crap. comparing them only heightens my dislike of a game of thrones. in truth, it's simply a marketing strategy to compare new books to ones that are already really popular, in order to draw in a well-established audience. 
 this is an epic fantasy - epic in scope - but it's also a bildungsroman, a story of a person's life, a life journey (including the quiet moments), which i love. the character development is ludicrously good. the world-building is solid, believable and original - there're enough new elements to keep your interest, but not so many that you get confused and overwhelmed: a perfect balance. the design of ""sympathy"" is original and unique, and makes so much sense that i'm half-surprised it doesn't really work. it's complicated enough to not be trite, but one basic premise is the connection between things, the sympathy they have with each other - if you broke a branch in two, the two halves would still have a connection, like sharing the exact same dna, and so if you control one half you affect the other half. same with two pennies of the same metal, so that, if you were holding one and someone holding the other and they worked a ""binding"" on their half, and, say, lifted it in the air, then your penny would also lift. it's fabulous! it's an intellectual kind of magic, not a ""wave the wand"" type. it takes knowledge, concentration and effort, so in effect, anyone could learn. 
 as for the characters and their growth, i am so impressed and so in love i will no doubt do a bad job of expressing it. while kvothe's story is told in his voice, first person, the present day interludes are told in third person omniscient, but usually from certain characters' points of view. you get a mix of other people's impressions of characters, and a gentle showing that tells us even more. the genius is in how kvothe is portrayed: while telling the story, himself as a young boy, already having experienced tragedy and sorrow and despair, and already feeling the weight of worldly concerns, but still with a lot to learn, comes across strongly. this is counter-balanced with kvothe as a man, having been through all that and more and had it shape him into something subtly different, yet still very much the same person. if it had been written poorly, there would have been discord between the two kvothes, but there isn't. he has so much charisma, and is such a complex sort, that i really felt for him. i may even have a bit of crush, actually. he's not good or evil, but he's suffering from a conscience: he's very human, and lonely, despite the friendship of bast. at the same time, he's a god-like figure, an amazing musician, a skilled fighter, and a powerful magician. one moment he's commanding and chillingly masterful, the next he's doing bast's bidding and fetching food and cutting wood for others. i expect it's his contradictions and complexities that draw me to him. 
 the writing style is smooth, the pacing just right (though the first few chapters take a while to get you into the story, you still need to read them closely because there're a lot of details in them), and the prose isn't cluttered with boring, irrelevant descriptions or pointless details. it's a fat book and a long story, but it flies by. while it needed better proofreading - there were a lot of problems with dialogue punctuation; there were a few lazy typos; he never once used a semicolon when he should have; and he always used ""lay"" instead of ""laid"" (but hey, at least he was consistent) - the prose itself is engaging, often humorous, detailed but not overly so, and never boring. i also loved the little songs and ditties that are included, and the stories within kvothe's story. 
 likewise, the way he doles out the various plots, revealing and hinting at the right moments, building up tension and anticipation, giving clues that start to coalesce into a stunning picture, is, frankly, impressive. the supporting cast, while not as fully explored as kvothe (it is his story, after all), are in their own ways vividly portrayed and gradually explored. there's no chunky exposition or a description of a character shoved at you all at once. it's more a show-not-tell kind of book, appreciating the intellect of its audience and our ability to figure things out for ourselves. nicely done. there was a while there, when i was reading, that the prose gave me the same kind of thrill as reading a sex scene in a romance novel might - but it could have just been the excitment of the story. 
 one last thing (though i could go on forever): i loved what he did with dragons. i won't spoil it by saying more, just that it's original and delightful - this coming from someone who's been known to get a mite bored by dragons in fantasy. 
 i would easily recommend this to anyone who enjoys fantasy, but also to people who enjoy great stories told wonderfully well. as many non-fantasy readers loved harry potter, they would also love this book. an ember in the ashes is truly a unique and captivating book that i recommends everybody reads! cannot wait for the second book in this series =d ** spoiler alert ** 
 the wait is going to kill me. 
 so, rather than wait patiently, i am going to gather various speculations and list facts to keep in mind. 
 please take note: this review contains spoilers for books 1 and 2 
 the doors: 
 so, as the third book in the kingkiller chronicle is named 'the doors of stone,' it is quite obviously required of us to consider the 'doors' of which they are speaking. and so, as perfectionism dictates, i will list every single door that i've noticed. 
 in skarpi's story of lanre, lanre battles a beast that, while he is able to kill said beast, kills lanre as well. however, one line is read pertaining to the beast's death that is not, in fact, read pertaining to lanre's. 
 ""after the battle was finished, and the enemy was set beyond the doors of stone..."" 
 lyra, of course, calls lanre back. this leads me to wonder if the doors of stone have something to do with death, the 'doors to the afterlife' 
 kvothe mentions doors in his mind; four of them, to be exact: sleep, forgetting, madness, and death (another indication that, maybe, death is the 'doors of stone' to which the title is referring.) this also brings me to a certain suspicion about the sleeping mind, but i will return to that later. 
 the main building of the university, mains, is quite literally described as a 'featureless stone block.' this 'featureless stone block,' inevitably, has stone doors. inscribed above these doors are the words 'vorfelen rhinata morie.' 
 in the archives, there are small rooms of stone for people to meet and talk (or have sex, if what fela claims is true). 
 of more importance are the doors of stone that kvothe sees just before he is banned from the archives 
 ""it was quite by accident that i found the four-plate door."" 
 the door is described as 'one seamless slab of grey stone.' four copper plates are on the outside, flush with the stone of the door, which is flush with the frame, which, in turn, is flush with the wall. it is also described as 'not a door for opening, but a door for staying closed.' the word 'valeritas,' is inscribed upon them. 
 there's a ventilation-shaft-like entrance to the archives from the underthing, but i'm not sure whether or not that matters. 
 elodin's cell in haven is made of stone. 
 and, last but not least, the mauthen farm is made with stone reinforcements. stone that is, in fact, dug up from barrows (burial mounds) in the ground, and used to build the house. this house was most likely destroyed by the chandrian. however, that has to do with a certain vase that, again, i will return to later. 
 felurian mentions doors of stone in one of her stories. 
 there are many more doors mentioned below in the comments; i don't have room to add them, or edit completely. 
 the king 
 so, we all know that kvothe is called 'kvothe kingkiller' for a reason. in fact, he says that he earned the name, 'bought and paid for it.' 
 so. nobility that is either a king, or will be a king, in the future: 
 at the top of our list is ambrose, the first born heir to a vintish barony. his father is one of the twelve most powerful men in vintas. he is sixteenth in the peerage. 
 lanre, also known as lord haliax, is a little more than nobility... and i can't see him gaining power enough to be recognized as a king by others, but he must be mentioned. 
 sovoy is of modegan nobility. 
 kvothe's mother and likely aunt meluan lackless are of vintish nobility. 
 maer alveron is said to be higher in the peerage than ambrose. 
 last, and the most painful to admit, is simmon. simmon is said to be of aturan nobility; according to sovoy, he is not high nobility, but he is nobility nonetheless. 
 i feel like kote talks about simmon's innocence so constantly as if to prove a point of surprising his audience in the end. if it is simmon he ends up killing, i wouldn't be terribly surprised. among other references to simmon's 'goodness' is this passage: 
 '""i love you sim."" 
 he looked me over. ""you're drunk."" 
 ""no, it's the truth! you're a good person, better than i'll ever be."" 
 he gave me a look that said he couldn't tell if he was being made fun of or not.' 
 the amyr 
 the amyr are a holy order of the aturan empire created to avenge the fall of myr tariniel, according to skarpi. they are a group of people under selitos, if the stories are to be believed, that hunt the chandrain. the most trusted and powerful of them are known as the ciridae, and their mark is a burning tower. if master archivist lorren is to be believed, they are equal part knight-errant and vigilante. they had judiciary powers and could judge in both religious and secular courts. all of them are exempt from the law, in varying degrees. they were also disbanded 300 years ago. 
 the ruach, named by aleph as the amyr in skarpi's story: 
 tehlu. 
 kirel- tall, burned but left living in the ashes of myr tariniel. 
 deah- a woman having lost two husbands to the fighting in myr tariniel. face, mouth, and heart are cold as stone. 
 enlas- would not carry a sword or eat the felsh of animals, would not speak hard words. 
 geisa- fair, with a hundred suitors in belen before the walls fell. the first woman to know the unasked for touch of man. 
 lecelte- laughed easily and often, even when there was woe thick about him. 
 imet- hardly more than a boy, who never sang and killed swiftly without tears. 
 ordal- the youngest of them all, who had never seen a thing die, a girl with golden hair. 
 anden- a face with burning eyes, his name means 'anger.' 
 it is said that atreyon is one of the amyr. he is, in fact, the one who is subject in the maer's favorite story, a bloody story. 
 sir savien is also mentioned as one of the amyr. 
 kvothe also suspects that the duke of gibea is one of the amyr, or that he worked for them at least. he's a medicinal worker of great skill under the authority of maer alveron. 
 ""none but the most powerful can see them, and only then with great difficulty and at great peril."" 
 kvothe, when he is near death in an alleyway in tarbean, says that he saw a bird of fire and shadow. he thought it was the bird of death, come to greet him, and he is about to slip away when, ironically, a man dressed as encanis gives him a silver talent and warms him. 
 ""the last time [aleph] touched them there was pain, and wings tore from their backs that they might go where they wished. wings of fire and shadow. wings of iron and glass. wings of stone and blood."" 
 kvothe is indeed powerful, and is not death the greatest peril of them all? could they have, in fact, saved him? but why? to spit in the faces of the chandrain who killed his family...? 
 who knows. why not. 
 the university 
 i happened to list a few things, in case i wanted to refer back to them later on: 
 master linguist, chancellor. 
 master rhetorician herma hemm 
 master archivist lorren (amyr?) 
 master arithmetician brandeur 
 master physiker arwyl 
 master chemist mandrag 
 master artificer kilvin 
 master sympathist elxa dal 
 master namer elodin 
 the three most important rules of the chemist: 
 -label clearly 
 -measure twice 
 -eat elsewhere. 
 mains is the oldest building at the university, and, apparently, nearly as complicated as hogwarts castle. 
 it came to my attention that master lorren wanted kvothe to ignore the chandrain and amyr. it makes me wonder. i decided that it was worthy of note. 
 the three cs of sympathy: 
 correspondence: similarity enhances sympathy. 
 consanguinity: once together, always together. 
 conservation: energy cannot be created nor destroyed. 
 (sympathy is based off of the laws of thermodynamics, the quantum entanglement theory, and voodoo dolls.) 
 alder whinn, we hear, went crazy at the university. he now has accommodations at haven, where it seems elodin has a special fondness for him. he demands that whinn should be allowed to come and go as he pleases, and that nothing should be added to his drink or food without his permission. this, i find curious. 
 and, the first name we hear elodin speak. 
 ""cyaerbasalien,"" and the stone broke. or, in this case i suppose, the stone wall moved. either way, he recited the story of taborlin while he did it, replacing taborlin's name with his own. i will return to this later. 
 auri: 
 ""i can tell you stories no one has ever heard before. stories no one will ever hear again. stories about felurian, how i learned to fight from the adem. the truth about princess ariel."" 
 could she be the princess that kvothe claims he 'rescued from the barrow kings'? could she be princess ariel? 
 after all, she does 'pour beer as if she were among kings.' 
 it is mentioned while simmon, wilem, and kvothe are talking of ambrose's revenge methods that a girl named tabitha 'made noise about how ambrose had promised to marry her,' and she disappeared. we know of a young woman, around ambrose's age, that lives alone on a rooftop. kvothe assumes that she must have gone insane from a too weak mind at the university. however, ambrose seems to have friends in very high places. 
 could auri be tabitha? it's a weak idea, sure, but it's still there. 
 auri gives kvothe a key and a ring. could the key be the key to the 'doors of stone?' 
 if you read the slow regard of silent things, she's certainly important enough to the story. 
 the ring is wooden, which is interesting. at the court in vintas in the wise man's fear, wooden rings are exchanged as tokens of hatred. we know that ambrose's family is from vintas. how do you suppose auri came about a ring like that, if the ring is in fact what i assume it to be? and if my earlier theory about auri being tabitha proves true, perhaps the ring came from ambrose. she claims that the ring keeps secrets. 
 it should also be noted that auri gives kvothe 'key, coin, and candle.' taborlin stories mention key, coin, and candle as his three tools. 
 auri's name is in kvothe's mother's trouper name: laurien. not that that should have any significance. 
 ""little moon fae."" 
 the cthaeh 
 he spoke to the cthaeh... he killed a king... could the cthaeh have driven him to do all of the things that he's done? could the entire story merely have been created through the will of the cthaeh? bast seems to think so. 
 denna 
 so, we all know who she is. well, maybe not her name exactly, but we all know that whatever he real name is, it stars with a d. diane. dyanae. denna. 
 it occurs to me that the lay of sir savien triliard may very well describe kvothe and denna's relationship. 
 love lost, than found, than lost again. 
 he lost her when he left the caravan. he found her at the eolian as he is singing this song, but where do you suppose he loses her for the last time? he does, obviously, for she is not present at the waystone, and he crushes a bottle of her favorite wine when driven to despair. 
 as a side note, when she and kvothe talk about the chandrian, there's a pale woman mentioned. could be a coincidence. 
 of course, the song also describes something of lanre's story. he dies and loses lyra, lyra resurrects him and they find each other, then lyra dies and the love is lost again. odd, considering that savien is one of the amyr... 
 there is a lot of mystery surrounding denna's patron. i read theories everywhere. 
 ""i think he's one of the amyr!"" 
 ""i think he's one of the chandrain!"" 
 ""i think it's a plot twist and he's actually a dragon!"" 
 ""i think he's possessed by a skin-dancer!"" 
 sovoy says, when kvothe meets denna again 'for the first time,' that if he promised her anything to repay her that she would order him off to find her a 'leaf from the singing tree' on the other side of the world. 
 i admit it's ridiculous, but when i heard singing tree, i immediately thought of the cthaeh. 
 kvothe also mentions felurian around the same time the 'singing tree' is mentioned. 
 ""i might keep referring to you as felurian, but that would lead to confusion."" 
 felurian and the cthaeh are connected, if you remember. 
 denna has not so far called him ""dulator."" and, if i'm remembering correctly, neither did felurian in wmf. correct me with a direct quote and page number if i'm wrong, please. 
 'my first mentor called me e'lir because i was clever and i knew it. my first real lover called me dulator because she liked the sound of it. i have been called shadicar, lightfinger, and six-string. i have been called kvothe the bloodless, kvothe the arcane, and kvothe kingkiller.' 
 could there be another woman we have yet to meet? 
 kote and the waystone inn 
 bast explains that you don't merely begin to believe that you are the mask you wear, but you also, eventually, become the mask you wear. he wants 'reshi' to open up to chronicler in order to remember when he was a hero. he's already broken down once, i can only imagine what'll happen to him next. 
 it is mentioned that 'kote' means 'disaster.' 
 expect disaster every seven years. 
 kvothe 
 this is a small section, but it has my most recent (and exciting) theory in it. 
 starting with the less important notes: 
 kvothe's eyes: 
 they turn frosty green when he's terrified. 
 muddy when he's in a horrible state of stress. 
 dark when he's angry, protective, or in any way filled with adrenaline (or, as kvothe jokes, 'it could be just old fashioned lust,' which, i suppose, makes sense if i'm right about the adrenaline.) 
 normally, they are a bright green with a gold ring around the pupil. 
 he claims he gets them from his mother... but his mother was dark-eyed. 
 and both of his parents have dark hair, whilst his is a fiery red. 
 well, i say he's a changeling. as do many others. 
 a changeling, in case you are unaware, is a fae infant that is switched with a human infant, in order for the fae infant to grow off of the human's nourishment. sort of like a cuckoo bird. 
 it explains how he picks things up so quickly, it explains why bastas is his student. it explains why he looks so different from his parents. 
 the changeling is mentioned a fair bit in faerie lore, thought not yet in rothfuss's faerie lore. 
 the chandrain 
 this is primarily about the pictures on the vase found by little nina at the mauthen farm. the girl describes seeing a woman holding a broken sword; a man next to a dead tree; a man with a dog biting his leg; a man with white hair and black eyes (cinder, most likely); a man without a face, but rather a hood with nothing inside, a mirror at his feet and moons in different cycles over his head (haliax?); and a woman with some of her clothes off. these are six of the seven. 
 their signs of which i'm aware: 
 blue fire 
 rotting wood 
 rusting metal 
 the sleeping mind 
 kvothe says that the locked memories of his family are behind the doors of his mind. when ambrose breaks his lute, he is reminded of the breaking sound of his father's lute in tarbean, which probably reminds him of his father, the song, the scene of his dead troupe. 
 i believe that kvothe's sleeping mind contains these things, and that when ambrose broke his lute, he released those memories, and along with them, the rest of his knowledge. maybe remembering is the price he has to pay to awaken his sleeping mind. 
 meluan lackless 
 lady lackless. 
 kvothe sings a short tune about her in the beginning of the first book, when he was but a child. his mother scolds him for insulting lady lackless. his mother claimed that she is a real person, who has real feelings. 
 he meets her later, and she seems familiar to him, but he can't quite find out why. 
 lady lackless had a sister that was stolen away from her by the ruh. 
 kvothe's mother was mentioned to once have been nobility. 
 kvothe might still have family. 
 an aunt that shuns him for being edema ruh. an aunt he barely even recognizes. an aunt that, if she recognizes him, refuses to mention it. but still, she is an aunt. 
 as kvothe is so fond of saying, a half of a loaf is better than none, right? 
 the thrice locked box 
 a box to hold the name of the moon, kept by jax in the old faerie story. 
 a box belonging to meluan lackless that does not have a seam. 
 a chest in kote's inn, seamless according to bast, thrice locked. kvothe looks upon the chest with longing. 
 elodin panics at the mention of someone changing their name, referring to their true name. 
 kote. kvothe. 
 just remove that 'v' and 'h' 
 could that chest contain 'kvothe?' is that what kote wants, but can't stand to think about? 
 what does that box contain that is so important to him? his name, his shaed, what? 
 kvothe and elodin 
 kote is to kvothe, as elodin is to taborlin. 
 a possible direct parallel. 
 kote is undercover at an inn. elodin at a school *where he is master namer.* 
 he's been to the faen realm, as he so obviously reveals when he identifies kvothe's shaed. he also, apparently, knows a smattering of ademic. 
 could he have blown past the years of taborlin in fae, and returned as elodin? and, if not... do we know if taborlin had children? that is, if he isn't merely a story... 
 but don't all stories have some truth to them? 
 kvothe tries to open up to the young blacksmith boy at the inn. 
 elodin tries to open up to kvothe at the asylum... in a way. of course, he did order him to jump off a roof. 
 and he tells the story of taborlin, yet he uses his own name in taborlin's place, shattering stone and breaking out of the prison. 
 he seems young, yet seems to possess knowledge of someone much older. 
 maybe i'm thinking about this backwards. time goes by faster for a man in fae than in real life, right? so... if that were so, wouldn't he be older than he actually is...? 
 of course it has flaws... but it makes equal bits of sense and nonsense and, ultimately, it's extremely frustrating. 
 other notable things 
 there are ten words to break a strong man's will... could these ten word have been spoken to kvothe, breaking his power? 
 wisdom precludes boldness. 
 ""the scrael, the war, all my fault."" 
 bast demands of chronicler not to ask kote why he can't do sympathy. 
 the number seven 
 seven chandrain. 
 expect disaster every seven years. 
 seven men didn't cross to tehlu's side in trapis' story. 
 ""is six a good number?"" 
 ""well, for a lucky number i'd have to go down to three, or up to seven.""-kvothe. 
 it took kvothe seven days, start to finish, to memorize all of the runes for sygladry. 
 lackless keeps seven things beneath her black dress. 
 that's it, for now. *i received this arc in exchange for an honest review and honestly? i bloodydamn loved it* 
 you think you've read a dystopian book? quit lying to yourself. that was teenage angst wrapped in a shiny new package, cashing in on the popularity of this genre. 
 you think you've read about evil futuristic regimes? nope, those were one dimensional villains that will look cartoony compared the assholes in this book. 
 you think you've seen hurt and suffering and despair and heartache? you've seen nothing. 
 you think you've seen to the very depths of the depravity mankind is capable of? 
 you've seen nothing. 
 i won't call this book ""the next hunger games"" and nor should anyone else, in my opinion. but i'm sure some degenerate in a pr office will think it's a great idea. my advice? don't listen to that douchebag. to do so would be insulting to red rising. 
 don't get me wrong, i loved the hunger games and there are a few parallels between that series and this book. even so, this book shouldn't be compared to anything. this book is what it is and it stands alone on a desolate field surrounded by the burning embers of its lessers because this book is just...more. it's harder, darker, more emotional, more horrific, more...everything. 
 pierce brown, how the hell do you expect me to read something else after this? or sit around and wait for the next installment? are you writing it? is it already done? is it half done? are you in need of an amateur editor??? i'm the girl for the job! pick me! meeeeee!!!! 
 fyi, my version of editing will be to drool over whatever you produce and provide zero constructive feedback while demanding you write faster and trying to hide the intensity and frequency of my eye twitches. also, there may be threats involving tofu for ""motivational"" purposes. 
 you probably want to know what it's about, right? okay, i'll try to settle down. 
 the story takes place on mars, inside a futuristic colony. our main character, darrow, is the youngest helldiver in memory and he operates a massive and massively complicated drill-like piece of machinery deep within the sulfurous bowels of the planet. he's a red, the caste of people relegated to living like moles. 
 when we meet him, he's under the impression that he and all of his caste are digging helium3 so that one day the surface above will be hospitable for future generations. even though he's just sixteen, he's married and madly in love with his equally young bride, eo. hearing about her through his perspective, you understand why. she's vibrant and beautiful and charming and witty and fierce, the sunshine that lights up their subterranean world. because the book blurb mentions this, i don't feel like i'm spoiling anything by saying that when she dies, a little piece of you may die too, drained away with the tears that will spill from your eyes. what will bubble up to fill the gap it leaves behind is a primeval part of yourself, made of vengeance and anger. 
 this monstrous little piece of you is further fueled by the lies the authorities tell the reds, by the inequality and the forced brutality you're made to bear witness to. by the time you reach the middle of the book you may find that savage part of you has taken over and that you've hate-morphed into a ten foot tall, scale-covered ragebeast armed with razor teeth and three inch claws made for rending the flesh of the golds, the highest caste and the perpetrators of all these crimes. don't be alarmed, it happened to me too. 
 from the mines you watch darrow rise, discover the truth of life on mars, take his first shell-shocked steps on a city street and transform into something nearly as monstrous as your ragebeast. and you're with him all the way, rooting him on, cheering his brilliance and his blood thirst. i absolutely loved his character, loved how his mind worked. and you know what else i loved about him? he's not perfect. he's not some born leader. he does horrific things, makes bad choices and hard decisions. but he learns from his mistakes, becomes better, stronger, smarter. 
 surrounding him is a support cast of miscreants, sycophants, psychopaths, feral children, government men who think themselves gods and the rebel leaders who wait to rise up against them. none of them are one dimensional. all of them pulled some sort of emotion from me, whether it was love or hate or amusement or pity. 
 pair these characters with the sweeping backdrop of a war whose participants have forgotten it is a game and you have one brutal and gorydamn epic novel. 
 this book is a stark foray into survival and society, into the heart of human darkness and the height of its heroism. one part dystopian, one part sci-fi and one part epic war fantasy, it transcends a conventional genre and enters the realms of amazeballs. 
 read it. 
 this review can also be found at the alliterates. here are my reviews of the previous books in this series:

 the assassin's blade 
 heir of fire 
 queen of shadows 
 these two girls said it all simona's review , paige's video 
 *sigh* i'm not sure where to start. i've pretty much loved all the previous books in this series but aghhh this one. 
 welcome to empire of storms the try not to cringe challenge book edition. 
 the first thing that you notice while reading empire of storms is the similarities it has with acomaf. i think that in trying to release two huge books a year sjm doesn't really have enough time to properly edit her books anymore. the two books ended up sounding exactly the same except that acomaf was much, much better. i can imagine sjm getting to eos and being like ughhh i've already written this before. 
 the sex scenes situation: i have nothing against steamy scenes in ya books. i believe it makes the book more realistic and we all love seeing our otp finally getting down to business. however, what i don't like is seeing a ya book turn into straight up erotica. 
 there's a scenes that combines my first two complaints about this book. brace yourself. 
 remember the mountain situation is acomaf? 
 ""rhys roared as he came, slamming in to the hilt. outside, the mountains trembled, the remaining snow rushing from them in a cascade of glittering white, only to be swallowed up by the waiting night below."" 
 well, if rhys can make a mountain tremble imagine what good ol' rowan could do. 
 ""rowan's own release barreled through him at the sight of it, lightning joining wind and ice over the water. 
 aelin held him through it, sending the fire-opal of her magic to twine with his power. on and on, as he spilled himself in her, lightning and flame danced on the sea. 
 the lightning continued to strike, silent and lovely, even after he stilled."" 
 are you cringing yet ? alright, moving on. 
 i'm so done with aelin trying to be sassy all the freaking time and bossing people around. oh, and is it normal that she doesn't share any of her plans with anyone? 
 this book has no diversity whatsoever. every single main character is straight and white af. sjm has like 50 pov characters between her two series, you'd think some of them would be a little different right? right? wrong. 
 also, every single character is blindingly beautiful. 
 oh and let's not forget that most characters are royalty for some reason. 
 you're a queen and you a king ! let's throw a prince in there and another king and another queen. 
 aww my gaawwd ! 
 chaol who? 
 remember that main character we were in love with for three books? 
 nop? okay. 
 characters acting out of character: dorian felt really off in this book. he didn't sound like dorian just like chaol didn't sound like chaol in the previous book but we got rid of that problem now. didn't we? 
 must every single character be in a relationship? 
 i'm seriously not feeling manon and dorian's relationship. i had a feeling she was gay. i don't know maybe it's just me. 
 for some reason the narrative is mostly third person limited but we randomly jump into other people's minds here and there. 
 ps: thanks for everyone who pointed out that aedion is actually bi-sexual i didn't omit this fact on purpose. it just slipped my mind when i was writing the review. 
 i hope i didn't forget anything. anyway, before you bite my head off, i just want to say that i do love sjm's writing and i think the plot of this book and the series as a whole is great. this book could have been amazing if there wasn't so many things annoying me about it. 
 this is just my honest opinion. feel free to leave a comment so we can discuss. stop press:

 how much can i rave about these books? 
 this review contains *spoilers*. 
 i've been waiting for this moment for months now, but i can finally say that i've finished reading the raven king. i was so nervous going into this because my expectations were sky-high, but it is everything i could've dreamed it to be and more. i felt like my heart was cracking throughout this whole experience. 
 depending on where you began the story, it was about gansey and the revelation that he knows that this might be his last year to find the king and complete his ongoing quest once and for all. 
 the raven king is set a week after the events of the last book, maura is back home with artemus, who knows more than he is saying and is acting rather peculiar- especially when gwenllian is around. and blue and her raven boys are still on their quest to find the king. 
 the uncertainty over everything kept me on the edge for the entire story. it felt like the end of everything. 
 i was hooked as soon as i read the first sentence. and i was so into the story that i couldn't stop reading until the last page (and i unfortunately had a huge headache after reading so much). 
 but i laughed, i cried, i mourned. 
 what more could i ask of stiefvater, a master storyteller? 
 she creates these atmospheric, impressionistic scenes with this quiet but impeccable style. 
 i want everyone to know her talents but i don't want to share her with anyone. 
 for the past month i've talked and ranted so much about these characters that even my mom got invested and was waiting for me to tell her what happened in the final book. (by the way, she said that gansey wasn't going to die) (thanks mom for believing.) 
 as i mentioned before, it starts with gansey's incredibly rich and unique tale and continues with his found family. 
 ""where the hell is ronan?"" gansey asked, echoing the words that thousands of humans had uttered since mankind developed speech."" 
 what is my review worth without mentioning ronan too many times? 
 but seriously, he continues to amaze me and he's just an all-time favorite of mine that i won't be letting go of any time soon. 
 also, i'm in love with this fanart of him: 
 source 
 ""gansey asked, ""do you have time to run an errand with us? do you have work? homework?"" 
 ""no homework. i got suspended,"" blue replied. 
 ""get the fuck out,"" ronan said, but with admiration. ""sargent, you asshole."" 
 blue reluctantly allowed him to bump fists with her as gansey eyed her meaningfully in the rearview mirror."" 
 my life, i love ronan too much. my new goal is for him to say the exact same things to me. 
 ""for what?"" 
 ""emptying another student's backpack over his car. i don't really want to talk about it."" 
 ""i do,"" ronan said. 
 ""well, i don't. i'm not proud of it."" 
 ronan patted her leg. ""i'll be proud for you."" 
 he's seriously the best. 
 ""strange he hadn't had a premonition of what this place would become to him all those months ago. "" 
 adam perfectly described how i feel about this series. these books have become my home and i cannot believe it took me so long to discover. i love it in a way that nearly overwhelms me with gratitude 
 i also loved that this book focused on the romance (among many other happenings), and it was slow, uncertain and exquisitely written. my heart is still happy and beating like crazy. 
 ""each of the trees they passed sounded with a processed thud, until the sound around them was the pulsing electronic beat that invariably played in ronan's car or headphones. 
 ""oh god,"" gansey said, but he was laughing. ""do we have to endure that here, too? ronan!"" 
 ""it wasn't me,"" ronan said. he looked to blue, who shrugged. he caught adam's eye. when adam's mouth quirked, ronan's expression stilled for a moment before turning to the loose smile he ordinarily reserved for matthew's silliness. adam felt a surge of both accomplishment and nerves. he skated an edge here. making ronan lynch smile felt as charged as making a bargain with cabeswater. these weren't forces to play with."" 
 and while i'm on the topic of ronan, i finally got to see him with his brothers and it was too good to be true. i was so happy maggie included it. 
 ""where are you? in your room?"" 
 ""dur."" 
 ""i'm serious."" 
 ""hur."" 
 ""matthew."" 
 ""yah, yah, i'm in my room. sl hates you. it's like two or sumthin'. whatdya want?"" 
 ronan didn't reply right away. matthew couldn't see him, but he was curled on his bed back at monmouth, forehead resting on his knees, one hand gripping the back of his own skull, phone pressed to his ear. ""just to know you're all right."" 
 "" 'm all right."" 
 ""go to sleep, then."" 
 ""still sleeping now."" 
 the brothers hung up."" 
 ronan is seriously messing me up. i love him with all my heart. 
 and another favorite part in this book was when declan and ronan finally sat down and just talked. 
 ""declan started: ""we need to talk about your future."" 
 ""no,"" ronan said. ""no, no, we don't."" 
 he was already most of the way out of the car, leaves snapping dead under his shoes. 
 ""ronan, wait!"" 
 ronan did not wait. 
 ""ronan! before he died, when he and i were out together, dad told me a story about you."" 
 it was wickedly unfair. 
 it was wickedly unfair because there was nothing else that would have stopped ronan from walking away."" 
 why does his childhood make me cry? 
 ""declan paused then, sighing, as if the weight of the story was a tangible thing, and he needed to take a moment to regain his strength. it was true that the memory of the ritual was heavy enough. ronan was all tangled up in half-formed images of his father sitting on the end of matthew's bed, the brothers tumbled together at its head, his mother perched on that tatty desk chair no one else would sit at. she loved these stories, too, especially the ones about her."" 
 i really love hearing about his childhood. 
 ""on the outside, the three lynch brothers appeared remarkably dissimilar: declan, a butter-smooth politician; ronan, a bull in a china-shop world; matthew, a sunlit child. 
 on the inside, the lynch brothers were remarkably similar: they all loved cars, themselves, and each other."" 
 ronan and his family are unlike anyone else and i love how everyone is involved in this book and that the adults care about the kids and vice versa and nobody is excluded and it's just great great great. 
 also great great great, were adam and ronan: 
 ""what are you trying to find out?"" 
 adam described the circumstances surrounding his eye and his hand with the same level tone he would use to answer a question in class. he allowed ronan to lean in to compare his eyes - close enough that ronan felt his breath on his cheek - and he allowed ronan to study the palm of his hand. the latter was not strictly necessary, and they both knew it, but adam watched ronan closely as he lightly traced the lines there."" 
 maggie knows exactly where to hit home for me. 
 ""why are we here?"" he asked. 
 ""wrong devil,"" adam replied quietly. 
 it had not been that long since the court case against his father. he knew that ronan remained righteously furious over the outcome: robert parrish, a first-time offender in the eyes of the court, had walked away with a fine and probation. "" 
 ""what ronan didn't realize was that the victory hadn't been in the punishment. adam didn't need his father to go to jail. he had merely needed someone outside the situation to look at it and confirm that yes, a crime had been committed. adam had not invented it, spurred it, deserved it. it said so on the court paperwork. robert parrish, guilty. adam parrish, free."" 
 i love adam and yes, he continues to break my heart. adam is the one i related to the most, and i'm so proud of him and his character growth. and i love how ronan and adam support one another. 
 i was barely recovering from them when i got to see gansey and blue being so sweet. all i can say is that gansey has got a way with words. 
 ""it was this: gansey starting down the stairs to the kitchen, blue starting up, meeting in the middle. it was gansey stepping aside to let her pass, but changing his mind. he caught her arm and then the rest of her. she was warm, alive, vibrant beneath the thin cotton; he was warm, alive, vibrant beneath his. blue slid her hand over his bare shoulder and then on to his chest, her palm spread out flat on his breastbone, her fingers pressed curiously into his skin. 
 i thought you would be hairier, she whispered. 
 sorry to disappoint. the legs have a bit more going on. 
 mine too."" 
 i'm really glad he and blue stopped trying to hide their relationship from the group. and gansey being, as maggie said in her recap, a dick but not a dick: 
 ""he gathered himself. adam saw his gaze land on blue. judging, perhaps, whether or not she knew what he was about to say, or whether he should say it. he touched his thumb to his lower lip, caught himself at it, lowered his hand. 
 ""blue and i have been seeing each other,"" he said. ""i don't want to hurt any feelings, but i want to keep seeing her. i don't want to hide it any more. it's eating me, and nights like this, having to stand here and look at blue with her face like this and pretend like --"" he drew himself to a stop, a full stop, a silence so intense that no one tipped any other sound into it. then he finished, repeating, ""i cannot ask you to do things i haven't been doing myself. i'm sorry for being a hypocrite."" 
 ""blue took gansey's hand. 
 adam was glad she did. 
 ""gross,"" ronan said, which was the most juvenile response possible. 
 but gansey said, ""thanks for the input, ronan,"" with a proper look on his face again, and adam saw how cleverly ronan had released the tension of the moment. they could all breathe again."" 
 this is exactly why i love ronan so much. if anyone asked me why, i would just show this one quote. 
 i think this book might be my favorite in the series because so much happened and i am in awe by maggie stiefvater's ability to write something so beautiful and descriptive, so exciting and so heartbreaking. 
 and as she also promised in her recap, henry cheng shows up more and i really liked him in this book, which i honestly wasn't expecting. 
 ""what are you doing here!"" blue demanded. she was feeling - she wasn't sure. she was feeling a lot. 
 ""i'm here to talk about the men in your life. to talk about the men in my life. i like the dress, by the way. very boho chic or whatever. i was on my way home, and i wanted to find out if you had a good time at the toga party and also make sure that our plans for zimbabwe were still on. i see you tried to claw your own eye out; it's edgy."" 
 ""blue said, ""i can't get in this car. do you see what's happening behind me? i don't even want to look."" 
 henry said, ""how about you give me the finger and shout at me now and withdraw with your principles?"" he smiled winningly and held up three fingers. he counted to two with devil horns. 
 ""this is incredibly unnecessary,"" blue told him, but she could feel herself smiling. 
 ""life's a show,"" he replied. he counted one with his middle finger, and then his face melted into exaggerated shock. 
 blue shouted, ""drop dead, you bastard!"" 
 ""fine!"" henry screamed back, with slightly more hysteria than the role required."" 
 he was such an intriguing character, especially with the whole robobee situation. 
 and then the book circles back to ronan and adam, and i'm not freaking out or smiling or anything like that: 
 ""he wordlessly crossed the floor and sat beside adam on the mattress. when he held out his hand, adam put the model into it. 
 ""this old thing,"" ronan said. he turned the front tyre, and again the music played out of it. they sat like that for a few minutes, as ronan examined the car and turned each wheel to play a different tune. adam watched how intently ronan studied the seams, his eyelashes low over his light eyes. ronan let out a breath, put the model down on the bed beside him, and kissed adam."" 
 he surprised me so much that my heart started beating too fast. it was such a perfectly build up moment and i'm speechless and in love and in tears and and and. time stopped for me. this is giving me life right now, this is giving me so much life. 
 ""he was pretty sure he had just been ronan's first kiss."" 
 i reread that page so many times that i now remember every single word. someone finally got kissed, my favorite someone, and it was such a genuine and real moment. too good for words. 
 i was speechless for so long, but henry managed to perfectly describe how i was feeling: 
 ""his mother was the only one who knew what henry meant when he said that he wasn't good with words. she was always trying to explain things to his father, especially when she had decided to become seondeok instead of his wife. it is that, she for ever said, but also something more. "" 
 this is exactly how i feel when i try to explain my love for this series and the characters within. 
 but then, you know what's happening next, the most painful moment that i dreaded and hoped hoped hoped wouldn't happen. (but secretly wanted to see played out-- but also didn't.) 
 ""tell me where owen glendower is,"" he said to the darkness. crisp and sure, with the same power he had used to command noah, to command the skeletons in the cave. ""show me where the raven king is."" 
 ""wait. you're going to junk up your nice coat, white man. take this."" he shouldered out of his aglionby sweater and proffered it. 
 ""so you're literally giving me the shirt off your back,"" gansey said, swapping him for his coat. he was grateful. he looked up to henry. ""see you on the other side. excelsior."" 
 i started crying here because no, henry, no. 
 but then gansey and the group find glendower and go in, only to find it to be not as they imagined: 
 ""the only thing was that gansey had always feared that he would find glendower just a little too late. minutes, days, months after death. but this man had been dead for centuries. the helmet and skull were only metal and bone."" 
 ""gansey touched the skull, the raised cheekbone, the face of his promised and ruined king. everything was dry and gray. 
 it was over. 
 this man was not going to ever be anything to gansey. 
 ""gansey?"" blue asked. 
 every minute was giving way to another and then another, and slowly it sank into his heart, all the way to the centre: 
 it was over."" 
 but it wasn't really. 
 ""one of the great things about blue sargent was that she never really gave up hope. he would have told her this, but he knew it would only upset her more. he said, ""i can't watch ronan die, blue. and adam - and matthew - and all this? we don't have anything else. you already saw my spirit. you already know what we chose!"" 
 blue closed her eyes, and two tears ran out of them. she did not cry noisily, or in a way that asked him to say anything different. she was a hopeful creature, but she was also a sensible creature."" 
 i was hopeful till the last page. 
 ""there was no time. 
 ""thanks for everything, henry,"" gansey said. ""you're a prince among men."" 
 henry's face was blank. 
 blue said, ""i hate this."" 
 it was right, though. gansey felt the feeling of time slipping - one last time. the sense of having done this before. he gently laid the backs of his hands on her cheeks. he whispered, ""it'll be ok. i'm ready. blue, kiss me."" 
 the power to stay quiet in the middle of the night while crying was nearly impossible, especially when listening to sad music. 
 ""he pulled back from her. 
 out loud, with intention, with the voice that left no room for doubt, he said, ""let it be to kill the demon."" 
 right after he spoke, blue threw her arms tightly around his neck. right after he spoke, she pressed her face into the side of his. right after he spoke, she held him like a shouted word. love, love, love. 
 he fell quietly from her arms. 
 he was a king."" 
 maggie really knew how to destroy me, i needed him back. 
 ""ronan crouched beside him, black still smeared on his face under his nose and around his ears. his dreamt firefly rested on gansey's heart. ""wake up, you bastard,"" he said. ""you fucker. i can't believe that you would ..."" 
 and he began to cry."" 
 ""i just don't understand,"" henry said. ""i was so sure that this was going to ... change everything. i didn't think it would end like this."" 
 ""i always knew it was going to end like this,"" she said, ""but it still doesn't feel right. would this ever feel right?"" 
 would it? 
 ""the minute hand quivered. it quivered again. 
 blue was already tired of a timeline without gansey in it. 
 adam looked up from where he was folded in the grass. his voice was small. ""what about cabeswater?"" 
 ""what about it?"" ronan asked. ""it's not powerful enough to do anything any more."" 
 ""i know,"" adam replied. ""but if you asked - it might die for him."" 
 i seriously cannot remember a time when i've felt so deeply for a character's (near) death. 
 ""the last tree fell, and the forest was gone, and everything was absolutely silent. 
 blue touched gansey's face. she whispered, ""wake up."" 
 i truly applaud stiefvater for everything she managed to conclude in this book. she really brought him back. and ronan and adam and blue and everyone and just thank you. 
 ""he closed his eyes and he began to dream."" 
 this review and more can be found on my blog. it's harry freakin potter of course i love it 
 *reread in march 2017 (for the first time in like 5 years)(still wonderful) right after i finished this book, i had a bit of an accident. i was running with a pair of lightsabers when i tripped and fell and accidentally sliced the entire book to shreds!! maybe it's not a good idea to run with lightsabers... 
 city of fallen angels is amazing - oh wait, that was weird, my keyboard cut me off. this is some sort of conspiracy isn't it? like the way that certain unnamed sites sometimes don't like to publish non-glowing reviews. i never write those. *angelic smile* oh, did that angelic smile make me look like jace? he's such a pretty, shiny angel. *sigh* 
 as i was saying... this book is amazingly unnecessary. i'm sorry, fangirls. please don't eat me. 
 here is a general rundown. no specific twists are revealed just vaguely referenced, so possible spoilers: 
 part one 
 ch 1-2: simon talks to people. jace and clary talk to each other and kiss. 
 ch 3-5: simon talks to new guy. jace and clary talk to each other. 
 ch 6-8: clary talks to people. simon and jace talk about clary. 
 ch 9: jace, clary and simon all make out...oops, i mean, jace and clary make out. simon bites, ummmm, talks to girls and has relationship issues. 
 part two 
 ch 10-11: new guy is revealed. dun, dun, dun. blah, blah. an attack!! wonder woman saves the day. (wow, something actually happened.... for two seconds) vampire chat. 
 ch 12-13: people talk about the vampire chat. jace and clary do stuff. 
 ch 14-15: jace has issues. chatty, chatty, chatty. 
 ch 16-17: jace goes emo. weird stuff is revealed. 
 ch 18-19: clary believes in jace. things happen. 
 ch 20: chatting again. lovey dovey stuff. but wait - someone is alive! (luke skywalker scream - everyone join in with their best squeaky voice) nooooooooooo! 
 i have never given out a one star rating before. never! so trust me, i don't take this lightly at all and i don't enjoy being negative. making light of a bad situation is just something i try to do. however, i don't like disliking things and i never try to be flat out hateful about anything. to love everything would be great, but that's just not realistic. 
 don't just write me off as a hater and leave it at that. i actually really liked the original series. 
 let me explain - while knowing nothing of clare's plagiarism or the controversy surrounding the books, the need for something similar to buffy overwhelmed me, leading to the discovery of the urban fantasy genre. my first experience with this genre was the mortal instruments which had just released the third book. out of pure desperation, the fact that it was a derivative was not even almost a deterrent. clare told a fast-paced and action filled ya suspense, which was exactly what i needed at the time. 
 the first three mortal instruments had this addictive quality that made you need to read more, which led me to read this one. so while i still hold true to my original feelings of the first books and have a sick yet fond place in my heart for them, i truly feel that this particular series should have ended where city of glass left us. 
 it saddens me to think that i may have contributed to the mass production of unnecessary sequels. or to clare's dragon horde of gold. oh well, she's rolling in it, already. what exactly she deserves to be rolling in... i'll leave up to interpretation. this is a joke. no speculation is actually necessary. she's rolling in money. okay? are you happy?! you better be. 
 regardless of how much she has made, it is respectable for anyone to make bookoos of cash doing what they love. as long as they aren't hurting or taking advantage of anyone, there's no problem with it. although, sometimes large companies can take advantage of small time authors or even gullible readers, so it's a good thing that i got this from my library and didn't pay any of my own money (however, my library surely made a contribution). 
 it's too bad lesser-known books and their authors don't get the opportunities and the recognition that some of these more mainstream novels do. but that isn't how the industry works right now. hype sells. controversy sells. 
 fellow girl-power groupies: don't kill me. i liked jace in the original books. but i soon realized how destructive this small adoration can become. 
 now, fangirl mobbing is truly my greatest fear. so i don't want to piss anyone off, but jace is prick. a hot one, yes, and i readily admit to secret desires of being pursued by a ""bad boy"". but seriously? calm yourselves. he's fictional. 
 by the way that girls talk about him, you would think that his saliva is made of awesomesauce. 
 or that his face is made of the ark of the covenant. don't look directly at him! your skin might melt off. 
 i wanted to like this and wanted my jace crush to transfer over to this book. i swear i did. and maybe i was prepared to not like it because of a few certain friend reviews *cough* jillianhellionmajavinaya *cough* but i tried. really. enjoying this just wasn't in my power. 
 objectivity is something we should all strive for with every read. even after hearing bad things about a specific book, one can still have an open mind. when reviewing, we aren't trying to prove anyone right or wrong, we are just giving our own impressions about the book. 
 sometimes when an avid reader reads a mega-hyped book such as this, we can take on a similar persona to that of bill and ted. they are all about the excellent adventure. first and foremost with ya fantasy - we, mostly, want to be entertained. all the better if we learn something or absorb a good message while doing it, but the entertainment part is essential. 
 why i didn't like this book 
 not funny. at the time, i thought there was quite a bit of good humor in the originals. this one: nada. or maybe i've just outgrown it. the corners of my mouth never even lifted. in fact, a scowl probably made an appearance or two....or twenty. this book is to ""funny"" what vampires are to ""real"". (hint: they aren't) 
 not entertaining. every few pages i felt the need to go for a spin in my car with my head hanging out the window just to stay awake. the suspense, the tension, the action - everything i liked about the originals was gone. i'd say this book is about 1% action, 99% chatting. i may have entertained myself about this book, but this book did not entertain me. not for one second. 
 not new. this was a rehash of every conversation jace and clary and simon had in the first books that took up an entire book. clary, i love you but i can't because i think i'm evil. jace, you're so emo. simon, you're my best friend. this is a repeat. a rerun. and not even a funny rerun. it's like that sucky episode of friends with alec baldwin in it that no one cares to remember. 
 not inspiring. unlike most of my favorite books, there wasn't anything to take away from this book. if we are not going to be entertained then shouldn't we at least learn something or feel like we derived some deeper meaning from the book? 
 both ender's game and the hunger games had serious messages about war. the giver teaches us that human emotion is essential to our lives. what did city of fallen angels teach us? serious spoiler ahead. dont click unless you really want to know. that it is okay to be a prick because you've been possessed by a demon? maybe there was some deeper message and i just didn't see it because i was so bored. if so, i apologize for my oversight. 
 let's end on a high note, shall we? so i'll leave you with this: 
 even if i don't particularly like a book, i can usually find something good about having spent my time on it. this one was much more difficult to find that ""good part"", but i still managed to. 
 so despite not laughing once as a result of a joke in the book, i found myself, alone, laughing hysterically in my room about how horribly pointless this book was or about random crap that i find funny, usually involving jace and clary. somehow, i managed to amuse myself. 
 seriously. dumb stuff dances through my head like a frisky stallion does through a meadow full of unicorns. i wonder if jace is part unicorn, because unicorns are made of awesomesauce and rainbows..... i bet jace is made of rainbows. or at least, clary seems to think so - just wait until she figures out that he has no pots of gold. 
 and before i go find something awesome to read, i have something to ask you: 
 question: quick! both jace and clary are drowning. you can only save one. what should you do? 
 answer: let them both drown and read a different book!! this was funny and weird and fascinating and i had such a good time reading it! i just loved seeing how everything unfolded from this different perspective. it made twilight fresh and exciting again, and i really enjoyed it! ""i'm going to keep going until i succeed -- or die. don't think i don't know how this might end. i've known it for years."" -- harry potter 
 most seventeen-year olds don't view the possibility of an early death as being, well, possible. but then again, most seventeen-year olds haven't come face-to-face with death almost half a dozen times before their first kiss either. 
 in harry potter and the deathly hallows, the seventh and final installment of the ridiculously popular harry potter series, j.k. rowling brilliantly ties up every loose end that she has planted over the last ten years since the very first outing of the series was published in 1997. truly, rowling has learned exactly what her fans want and subsequently delivers a book that answers every potterhead's questions -- and then some. 
 not only does deathly hallows revisit key places and characters from all of the previous six books, but rowling even manages to make clever references to previous bits of dialogue from her earlier books. case in point: near the end of the first potter book, after hermione fails to see the magical solution to saving the trio from a nasty patch of devil's snare, harry's best mate ron bellows ""have you gone mad? are you a witch or not?"" now, six years later, hermione finally gets her revenge on her red-headed friend when ron believes that all is lost until hermione yells to him ""are you a wizard, or what?"" thus reminding ron to use his wand to solve their problem. subtle references such as this are a large part of what makes rowling's books so enjoyable to re-read as there are always deeper meanings and additional allusions that are often only discovered via multiple read-throughs. 
 harry's bold statement regarding his own potential death is also a prime example of how much rowling truly wrote harry's last tale for her long-time fans. this line seems to read as a secret ""shout-out"" to the potterites who have also known for years that the series might not end happily ever after. the prophecy in the fifth book revealed that ""neither shall live while the other survives"", and therefore by the end of book seven either harry or voldemort had to die. rowling cleverly fills her last installment with so many twists, turns and complications, however, that it becomes practically impossible to determine which way this book is going to end. 
 more than any of the other potter books, deathly hallows is a true quest narrative, with the trio spending the majority of the story hunting for horcruxes and hallows whilst evading capture by voldemort's death eaters. the multiple close-calls that all three main characters find themselves in throughout the book add to the tension that continues to build until the predictably bloody battle at the end of the tale. the book does, after all, chronicle a brutal war, so be prepared for a lot of killing and, consequently, a lot of tears. 
 this is not to say that deathly hallows doesn't offer up a great deal of laughs as well. the hilarious twins fred and george weasley make several appearances to ensure that the book isn't all doom and gloom. by far, the funniest part of the story is the secret radio show potterwatch, anonymously hosted by former hogwarts quidditch commentator lee jordan with special appearances from fred, george, and ex-defence against the dark arts professor remus lupin. rowling perfectly mixes this blend of humour, tragedy and adventure so that her epic-length novel never lags or drags. 
 to write a 607 page book that millions of die-hard fans around the world are able to devour in less than 24 hours is no mean feat, but rowling's farewell to the boy who lived is an incredibly gripping page-turner that will leave all potter lovers immensely satisfied. before i start my review, can we just take a minute to admire this beautiful piece of art featuring my favorites: 
 source 
 ""i will have you without armour, kaz brekker. or i will not have you at all."" 
 this review contains *spoilers*. 
 the wait for this grandiose sequel has been all-consuming, i've been thinking about the dregs for months and months now, so getting back into their lives has been one of the most rewarding experiences. 
 the book opens on wylan still wearing kuwei yul-bo's features since nina didn't trust herself with her powers now. it had been just under a week since the dregs reached ketterdam, almost a month since they'd left djerholm. and they're all fighting to get inej back before van eck could have his way with her. 
 they were almost out of time. but none of them knew the real game kaz ""dirtyhands"" brekker - the smooth, smart, criminal mastermind - was running. 
 and so, piece by piece, the plan to rescue inej had come together. 
 things were about to get dangerous. 
 ""why do you guys say that, anyway? no mourners, no funerals? why not just say good luck or be safe?"" 
 ""we like to keep our expectations low."" 
 literally one of my most pressing questions for the sequel was answered so quickly!! 
 but the days until van eck's deadline were dwindling, and to get inej back, they would need surprise on their side. only one shot at getting the wraith out of this situation. 
 but before all that can happen, we get to read from the pov of my favorite warrior: inej ghafa, legend of the barrel. and let me tell you, she is one of the most strong and determined and courageous characters i've known, so watching her doubt herself and her saints damn near broke me. what she had to go through in her first chapter left me both shaking and trembling. ghafa has my soul, heart and my enter being wrapped around her pinky. 
 ""when fear arrives, something is about to happen."" 
 meanwhile, the dregs have gathered enough intel to get their girl the hell out of van eck's hole. i felt truly terrified for inej because that brute managed to get into her head, but she was done being frightened of this man. and so was i--thanks to both her and the man of the hour, my favorite bastard of the barrel: kaz brekker with that demonic cane. 
 you know, i forgot for a second there just how dark he can be when it comes down to business. but he's called dirtyhands for a reason, and we're reminded just exactly what he had done to earn his reputation. 
 ""sometimes, the only way to get justice is to take it for yourself."" 
 i'm still furious at myself for believing that that smug merch son of a bitch could outthink kaz brekker. and with the help of his loyal dregs, they manage to get inej of out harm's way... but not without trouble coming their way. the kind of trouble even jan van eck hadn't foreseen: shu with wings (!!) looking to hunt and capture grisha. 
 but the deal is the deal and van eck has to pay up--dirtyhands is not someone to piss off. they'd set out to get inej back from van eck and they had. but they're not done with the merch. and the plan the dregs have set is so intricate that it will be the end of the van eck empire, without a shadow of a doubt. 
 okay so, here's the official plan to both earning their thirty million kruge and obliterating the devil himself: they're going after van eck's sugar crop, since he controls the silos where the supply is produced: 
 * thanks to wylan's weevil they can destroy the sugar in van eck's silos without being exposed. 
 * ""my father can weather a loss. the other merchants, the ones who own the sugar in his silos, will be hit worse."" 
 * and once the other merchants learn that van eck has been buying up sugar that isn't stored in his silos (thanks to kaz purchasing shares on behalf of van eck), his reputation will be annihilated. 
 ""van eck's reputation will take a hit when the sugar is lost. but when the people who paid him to keep it safe find out he profited from their loss, they'll look more closely at those silos."" 
 ""and find the remnants of the weevil,"" finished wylan. 
 ""destruction of property, tampering with the markets,"" inej murmured. ""it will be the end of him."" 
 * they'll get the weevil into the silos by letting tiny and ferocious inej do what she's best at: climbing up twenty stories high and walking a high wire from one silo to the next...no biggie. 
 * and while doing all of the above, they're also going to get the rest of the grisha out of the city, at nina's request. 
 a ship to ravka with twenty passengers (including kuwei) is conspicuous, so they're going to steal van eck's own transport to remain obscure. they couldn't just be smarter than their opponent, they had to be relentless. 
 * i just... why is everything so damn complicated with the dregs. they're nothing if not ambitious. 
 ""you couldn't go to war with an upstanding merch like van eck, not if you were a thug with a reputation dirtier than a stable hand's boot sole. to win, kaz would have to level the field. he would show the world what he already knew: despite his soft hands and fine suits, van eck was a criminal, just as bad as any barrel thug--worse, because his word was worth nothing."" 
 it's a known fact that kaz brekker is a smooth, smart, criminal mastermind, but he also hurts for his big, criminally inclined family. and watching him realize just that was one of my most cherished scenes. 
 ""he was going to break my legs ,"" she said, her chin held high, the barest quaver in her voice. ""would you have come for me then, kaz? when i couldn't scale a wall or walk a tightrope? when i wasn't the wraith anymore?"" 
 dirtyhands would not. the boy who could get them through this, get their money, keep them alive, would do her the courtesy of putting her out of her misery, then cut his losses and move on. 
 ""i would come for you,"" he said, and when he saw the wary look she shot him, he said it again. ""i would come for you. and if i couldn't walk, i'd crawl to you, and no matter how broken we were, we'd fight our way out together--knives drawn, pistols blazing. because that's what we do. we never stop fighting."" 
 i cant stop thinking about this without getting goosebumps. damn you, kaz. 
 you know, speaking of which, wylan finding out that his mother was still alive and in an insane asylum because of rotten van eck, made me want to string his father up in a barren field and let the vultures have at him, to quote jesper. 
 but seriously that whole situation made my heart race. i couldn't believe to what levels of evil van eck would sink. the only silver lining was the whole plan kaz had in store for the devil. and hopefully seeing wylan reunite with marya hendriks. i'm always weak for stories reuniting mother and son. always. 
 also, jesper trying to cheer wylan up made me shed a tear or two... 
 ""hey,"" jesper said, giving him a shake. ""hey. your father could have made a lot of choices when he found out you couldn't read. hell, he could have said you were blind or that you had trouble with your vision. or better yet, he could have just been happy about the fact that he had a genius for a son."" 
 ""i'm not a genius."" 
 ""you're stupid about a lot of things, wylan, but you are not stupid. and if i ever hear you call yourself a moron again, i'm going to tell matthias you tried to kiss nina. with tongue."" 
 wylan wiped his nose on his sleeve. ""he'll never believe it."" 
 ""then i'll tell nina you tried to kiss matthias. with tongue."" 
 they seriously deserve the world and so much more. they all did. 
 this was them at their best. 
 and then halfway through the book, the plan suddenly changes because ketterdam has turned on kaz. ""but if you couldn't open a door, you just had to make a new one."" and that's what dirtyhands excels at. 
 ""i know how to do it,"" kaz said slowly. ""how to get kuwei out, get the grisha out, get our money, beat van eck, and give that son of a bitch pekka rollins everything he has coming to him."" 
 nina raised a brow. ""is that all?"" 
 ""how?"" asked inej. 
 ""this whole time, we've been playing van eck's game. we've been hiding. we're done with that. we're going to stage a little auction. right out in the open."" he turned to face them, and his eyes gleamed flat and black as a shark's. ""and since kuwei is so eager to sacrifice himself, he's going to be the prize."" 
 my heart leapt like a horse clearing a jump. kuwei is going to auction himself with the hopes that the ravkans will end up buying him. it was the best chance they had of getting kuwei to ravka and saving grisha lives. to quote brekker, it was a mad, spiky monster of a plan, and that was what it had to be for them to succeed. 
 seriously though, how does bardugo keep up with herself? there were so many twists and turns that left my mind spinning even after having closed my eyes. the whole storyline is just so lancing--we know where the end-game is supposed to be, but to get there the dregs would have to go through hell and back. and damn, that they did. 
 but before hell comes their way, kaz and inej share an intimate moment that left me undone. he had gone to great lengths to prove he was capable of anything. 
 ""the sickness was there, the need to run, the need for something else too. kaz thought he knew the language of pain intimately, but this ache was new. it hurt to stand here like this, so close to the circle of her arms. it isn't easy for me either. after all she'd endured, he was the weak one. but she would never know what it was like for him to see nina pull her close, watch jesper loop his arm through hers, what it was to stand in doorways and against walls and know he could never draw nearer."" 
 i'll be 100% honest, this choked me up a little bit. 
 ""before he even knew what he intended, he lowered his head. she drew in a sharp breath. his lips hovered just above the warm juncture between her shoulder and the column of her neck. he waited. tell me to stop. push me away. 
 she exhaled. ""go on,"" she repeated. finish the story."" 
 my heart should not be making that sound. 
 ""the barest movement and his lips brushed her skin--warm, smooth, beaded with moisture. desire coursed through him, a thousand images he'd hoarded, barely let himself imagine--the fall of her dark hair freed from its braid, his hand fitted to the lithe curve of her waist, her lips parted, whispering his name. 
 all of it there and then gone. "" 
 this is heaven, what i truly want. i have no words to thank you for this. 
 seriously, leigh can write evocative, raw and hauntingly powerful scenes like nobody's business. 
 ""two of the deadliest people the barrel had to offer and they could barely touch each other without both of them keeling over. but they'd tried. he'd tried. maybe they could try again."" 
 they truly deserve their happy ending. 
 but in the end, it all came down to this: ""brekker, his wraith queen, his rotten little court of thugs."" because no matter what would happen, the dregs had a way of rewriting their own rules. 
 i mean, that ending... that ending was every bit as epic as i had anticipated. it either would've gone brilliantly or in total disaster, but that's generally the way this crew likes to work. 
 also, one last minor thing: i was on the edge the whole time to see who would survive, even though the table of contents kind of gave away who lives, who dies, who tells their story... but i cannot, for the life in me, believe matthias helvar got killed off by a young druskelle. this is not what i want. this is not what i planned. 
 ""after all their mad escapes and close calls, he'd started to believe the six of them were somehow charmed, that his guns, kaz's brains, nina's wit, inej's talent, wylan's ingenuity, and matthias' strength had made them somehow untouchable. they might suffer. they might take their knocks, but wylan was right, in the end they were all supposed to stay standing. 
 ""no mourners,"" said jesper, surprised by the ache of tears in his throat. 
 ""no funerals,"" they all replied softly."" 
 my eyes burned, tears streaming down my cheeks. i was whispering ""come back to me,"" right there with nina. 
 i just... i was rooting for everyone to have their happy ending. everyone. so this death came as such a shocking reveal. i felt sorrow dragging at my heart for hours after that. and i'm still not over it. 
 this saintsforsaken book has taken away a piece of my heart with that ending. i've got this ache in my chest that won't go away. i want to be free. but i know i won't be forgetting the dregs anytime soon. 
 5/5 stars

 this review and more can be found on my blog. okay, i'll admit it. i haven't read the whole anthology. but i'll admit i'm rather proud of the story i've got in here. it's called ""the lightning tree."" 
 it's got bast in it. the heat of the incinerator wrapped around inej like a living thing, a desert dragon in his den, hiding from the ice, waiting for her. she knew her body's limits, and she knew she had no more to give. she'd made a bad wager. it was as simple as that. the autumn leaf might cling to its branch, but it was already dead. the only question was when it would fall. 
 let go, inej. her father had taught her to climb, to trust the rope, the swing, and finally, to trust in her own skill, to believe that if she leaped, she would reach the other side. would he be waiting for her there? let go, inej. should she jump now or simply wait for her body to give out? 
 my mind is spinning. i tend to prefer simplicity in books. i hate a ridiculously complicated plot. i hate unnecessary characters. for the young adult genre, this book can best be described as epic, because. it. is. huge. it is complicated. it's like 
 ocean's eleven 
 for the ya fantasy crowd in the very best of ways. 
 there are 6 main characters. typically, that's 4 more than i'd like. the book's downfall is also what makes it great, and it's why i docked a star. it's epic. perhaps too epic. too complicated books tend to confuse me and let's face it, a large cast with different povs tend to make it extremely confusing for the reader - and it is, to an extent, true in this book. it is nonstop action with nary a moment to breathe. there is a cast of characters in the beginning, and by god, you'll need it. sometimes i felt like i was memorizing things for a test. 
 but the good is that the characters are all bad-ass. the packleader is an anti-hero, which, in my opinion, is the best kind of character. 
 kaz narrowed his eyes. ""i'm not some character out of a children's story who plays harmless pranks and steals from the rich to give to the poor."" 
 i like them dirty. and the book moves at a breakneck speed that'll guarantee the reader's interest. 
 there's magic - naturally. but a different kind of magic than such was found in the grisha. the characters are well-written, they're a ragtag band of misfits, and not exactly friends, but all are united for a common mission, and most importantly, they each have a purpose. there are no redundant, extraneous characters, but each character is doing this for their own reason. 
 four million kruge, freedom, a chance to return home. she'd said she wanted these things. but in her heart, she couldn't bear the thought of returning to her parents. could she tell her mother and father the truth? would they understand all she'd done to survive, not just at the menagerie, but every day since? could she lay her head in her mother's lap and be forgiven? what would they see when they looked at her? 
 the female characters are kick-ass. they're feminine, but not useless. they don't try too hard to be rebels to be bad-ass, to deny their own nature to prove they can play with the boys, they're just themselves...that's confusing, i know, but i can't describe it any other way. 
 there is romance, but so little of it, and what little there is felt natural and unobtrusive. a blossoming from grudging tolerance to like, to possibly something more. but i consider this a great book, because the romance is not intrusive in any way. 
 every time she moved, the reindeer cloak parted, revealing a flash of round calf, white skin, the shadow between her breasts. it was deliberate. he knew it. she was trying to rattle him. he needed to focus on the fire. he'd almost died, and if he didn't get a fire started, he still might. 
 nina snorted and lay down in the nest of pelts, propping herself on one elbow. ""for saint's sake, druskelle, what's wrong with you? i just wanted to be warm. i promise not to ravish you in your sleep."" 
 ""i'm not afraid of you,"" he said irritably. 
 her grin was vicious. ""then you're as stupid as you look."" 
 he stayed crouching beside the fire. he knew he was meant to lie down next to her. the sun had set, and the temperature was dropping. he was struggling to keep his teeth from chattering, and they would need each other's warmth to get through the night. it shouldn't have concerned him, but he didn't want to be near her. because she's a killer, he told himself. that's why. she's a killer and a witch. 
 halle-freaking-lujah! survival + rationality > romance!!!!!! *wipes away tear* i never thought i'd see the day. i said it before and i will say it again, the dark artifices is cassandra clare's most sophisticated work yet. 
 (heads up: my goodreads review is spoiler free but hopefully later this week i'll be posting my spoiler-filled and probably way too long video review to my youtube channel: youtube.com/emmmabooks) 
 lord of shadows is the sequel we've all been waiting for. it has the same amount of high-intensity, beautifully constructed, and deep, yet comedic content we love to see from the shadowhunter chronicles . lord of shadows delves deeper into the shadowhunter world than we've ever seen before. from the repercussions of the cold peace, the rising tensions between downworlders and shadowhunters, to the nuclear bombs waiting to detonate between character relationships, everything about this series expands into a bigger and better tale than i could have anticipated. i had so many theories going into this book and while some were confirmed, some were *basically* correct, others were thoroughly off but the execution was much greater than anything i could have imagined. anything i could have asked for was either delivered as i wanted, or something i didn't even know i wanted until it was given to me. 
 i loved that we were able to get more perspective from a variety of other characters (kit, ty, livvy, dru, & diana). while i feel every character in this series has grown from book one to two, it really was a pleasure to learn more about this specific set of characters and get to know them better. we do also get four cameos from tmi characters which i was totally satisfied with and happy to see. but i do specifically feel that emma, julian, mark, and cristina have done more maturing than most. i just feel that with all the burdens each of them carry, they begin to face them head-on, which made me very proud. i think any reader who loves the tda characters will be impressed with the character development in the sequel! 
 as per usual, the plot of the next installment of the shadowhunter chronicles is insane. i love how effortlessly the stories of tmi, tid, even a bit of tlh, and somethings i can allude to for twp are implemented into the present series. i loved all of the different journeys our protagonists went on; from london, to cornwall, to faerieland, to idris, there's so much adventure and excitement to love. of course, within that comes all of the devastation which no one is prepared for, but still flawlessly written, nonetheless. 
 as always, i have to applaud cassie for continuing to grow and improve her craft. i truly believe every single book in the shadowhunter chronicles gets better and better as the story deepens. i'm particularly impressed because i saw risks with lord of shadows that weren't always taken in past books and i stand by all decisions made (yes, even each of the deaths!) i'm satisfied, elated, heart-broken, and blown away all in one. 
 of course, i'd highly recommend reading lord of shadows. i cannot wait for you all to experience this story! i go so emotional at the end, so good! 4.25 wow!! woo hoooo!!! feyre is rock!! this book is rock!!!! 
 bwahahahaha feyre!! my girl, that's it! that's it! yesss!! *dies* the next book! *dies!!* rhys rhys!! my... mineeee!!!! love it! romance! night court!! this book!!! yes yes! <3 4.5 
 i loved this! a review will be up on my channel on friday! (obviously a reread) *cries* i didn't enjoy this book as much as i should have. i kept distracting myself with the thought, ""why the hell haven't i read more of neil gaiman's books?"" then i would have to tell myself to shut up, because i'm reading one right now, and i can return to berating myself later. 
 neil gaiman really understands fantasy. he understands that it isn't elves dancing in a forest and drunk dwarves mining for gold with improbably well maintained beards. no, fantasy is a reflection of reality, but fantastic. it isn't an alternate reality, but reality through the lens of imagination, and possibly some mind altering substances. 
 not only does he capture the essence of fantasy perfectly, but he does so with the trickiness and charming language that seems to be uniquely in the realm of british humorists. he rarely describes anything in a completely straightforward manner, instead choosing to almost fool the reader into visualizing his delightful (or, when appropriate, very undelightful) characters and events. 
 i couldn't help but to be completely charmed by and immersed into london below, right up until the point when some jackass started to wonder, ""why the hell haven't i read more of neil gaiman's books?"" 
 ============== 
 so, a few years later, and a lot of people seem to like this review, still. i've decided to abuse the popularity of this review to attempt to steer fans of neverwhere towards a few other books that i think they will enjoy. despite the theme of the review being ""read more neil gaiman"", the books listed below are actually by different authors, since i think i've already made it clear that you should read more neil gaiman. so, aside from all of those, here are a few other recommendations: 
 1. bridge of birds, by barry hughart - an epic, hilarious mythological adventure. 
 2.wool, by hugh howey - a pretty dark and serious tale of people living underground on a ruined world. 
 3. the baroque cycle, by neal stephenson - a globetrotting adventure set among a lovingly researched historical backdrop. 
 4. little brother, by cory doctorow - a nerd finds himself suddenly and unexpectedly being stalked by his own government, and doesn't think it's so cool. oooooooooh sooooooooooo goooooooooooddd hidden oracle 
 so fun and hilarious 
 i heart apollo 
 (a haiku book review in honor of the god of poetry) sigh... i just can't cassandra clare's extra jem & tessa story!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 after the bridge: the full story (jem/tessa) 
 http://cassandraclare.tumblr.com/post... 
 okay so i'm pretty sure anything i say will be a spoiler since everyone knows how hardcore i ship jem & tessa so my reading thoughts will be in the spoiler tag. 
 do not read it if you do not want to know what happens!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 also warning that the comments of this post now have spoilers. 
 i'm also going to start posting spoiler fan art there so keep away from the comments of this review until you finish reading. 
 you can dm me to discuss the spoiler stuff. 
 but keep calm jessa fans and wait for the epilogue :-d 
 dying to know what people think of the ending?!?!?! i don't know whether to love it or hate it. i mean it feels like a cheap ploy to keep both sides happy but i feel like i should just be happy with that. the epilogue is a jessa shippers dream come true! but even though it is technically a happy ending i was balling my eyes out through the entire book. i mean jem was so sweet, adorable, loving, selfless and perfect!!! he didn't want anyone to get hurt over him and just loved with all his heart. he is seriously like the most perfect character ever. <3 omg i love you james carstairs!!!! i cried when he found out about will's feelings and said he would have broken off the engagement. i cried when he said that he wanted tessa to grow to love will. i cried when he said he wanted to see charlotte's baby. i cried when he said silent brotherhood was his only choice. then i really seriously balled my eyes out when jem said goodbye to tessa and will. they had to live without him?!?!!? omg!!! then i as so happy during the epilogue that i cried some more. finally 130 years later he gets to have a happy life with tessa!!!!!!!!!!!! i wonder if we will get to see him and tessa together in the mortal instruments?! or the dark artifices?!?!?! i'm still kind of confused by the timelines of all this?! i believe mortal instruments is 2007 and the epilogue was 2008 so maybe a chance for dark artifices?! 
 so things that did piss me off. really?!?! jem was dying and tessa didn't sleep with him but right after they thought jem died she slept with will because she thought he might die?!?!?! and then at least after that they took time but i thought it was because will was giving tessa time to grieve and himself time to grieve but really he was just scared that tessa wouldn't love him like she did jem?! well of course not because jem is so much better than you! but whatever will died and now tessa is with jem!!!!! over all her lifetime with will and 71 years after his death she still never stopped loving jem or wearing his necklace!!!!!!!!!!! awwwwwwww!!! 
 favorite quotes - spoilers 
 ""i love you,"" she said. 
 he looked at her with a light in his thin face that made it more beautiful. ""wo xi wang ni ming tian ke yi jia gei wo."" 
 ""you..."" she drew her brows together. ""you want to get married? but we already are engaged. i do not thing on can get engaged twice."" 
 ""i said i would marry you tomorrow if i could."" 
 ""there will be another time,"" she said. ""another day, another dress. a time when you are well and everything is perfect."" 
 ""there is no such thing as prefect, tessa."" 
 foreshadowing to their future wedding that takes place after the epilogue?!?! 
 ""it is a strange thing, to be in love,"" he said. ""it changes you."" 
 ""zhe shi jie shang, wo shi zui ai ne de,"" he whispered. 
 she understood it. in all the world, you are what i love the most. 
 ""tessa, did you imagine that there exists any quarrel, large or small, that could make me stop loving you?"" 
 ""did you like it?"" he said. ""i could have given you...jewelry, but i wanted it to be something that was wholly yours. that no one else would hear or own. and i am not good with words, so i wrote how i felt about you in music."" he paused. ""did you like it?"" 
 ""then you did like it."" 
 ""it was like i saw your soul in the notes of the music. and it was beautiful."" 
 ""every heard has its own melody,"" he said. ""you know mine."" 
 ""i would give you everything of myself,"" he said. ""i would give you more in two weeks than most men would give you in a lifetime."" 
 ""when two people are as one in their inmost hearts, they shatter even the strength of iron or bronze."" 
 ""i can choose to be as much for her as i can be, to burn as brightly for her as i wish."" 
 ""you asked me if i have loved anyone but will,"" she said. ""and the answer is yes. i have loved you. i always have, and i always will."" 
 clockwork princess snippets! 
 tessa reached to brush the damp hair from his forehead. he leaned into her touch, his eyes closing. ""jem--have you ever--"" she hesitated. ""have you ever thought of ways to prolong your life that are not a cure for the drug?"" 
 at that his eyelids flew open. ""what do you mean?"" 
 she thought of will, on the floor of the attic, choking on holy water. ""becoming a vampire. you would live forever--"" 
 he scrambled upright against the pillows of the bed. ""tessa, no. don't--you can't think that way."" 
 ""is the thought of becoming a downworlder truly so horrible to you?"" 
 ""tessa ..."" he exhaled slowly. ""i am a shadowhunter. nephilim. like my parents before me. it is the heritage i claim, just as i claim my mother's heritage as part of myself. it does not mean i hate my father. but i honor the gift they gave me, the blood of the angel, the trust placed in me, the vows i have taken. nor, i think, would i make a very good vampire. [redacted for spoilers] i would no longer be will's parabatai, no longer be welcome in the institute. no, tessa. i would rather die and be reborn and see the sun again, than live to the end of the world without daylight."" 
 ""a silent brother, then,"" she said. 
 his eyes softened slightly. ""the path of silent brotherhood is not open to me."" 
 ----- 
 will's eyes met tessa's as she came closer, almost tripping again over the torn hem of her gown. for a moment, they were in perfect understanding. jem was what they could still look each other straight in the eye about. on the topic of jem, they were both fierce and unyielding. tessa saw will's hand tighten on jem's sleeve. ""she's here,"" he said. 
 jem's eyes opened slowly. tessa fought to keep the look of shock from her face. his pupils were blown out, his irises a thin ring of silver around the black. ""ni shou shang le ma, qin ai de?"" he whispered. ""are you hurt, my love?"" 
 omg what happened to jem?!?!?! cries! 
 ----- 
 ""wo wei ni xie de,"" he said, as he raised the violin to his left shoulder, tucking it under his chin. he had told her many violinists used a shoulder rest, but he did not: there was a slight mark on the side of his throat, like a permanent bruise, where the violin rested. 
 ""you -- made something for me?"" tessa asked. 
 ""i wrote something for you,"" he corrected, with a smile, and began to play. 
 ----- 
 ""though will was saying earlier,"" tessa added, ""that heroes all come to bad ends, and he could not imagine why anyone would want to be one, anyway."" 
 ""ah."" jem's hand squeezed hers briefly, and then let it go. ""well, will is looking at it from the hero's viewpoint, isn't he? but as for the rest of us, it's an easy answer."" 
 ""is it?"" 
 ""of course."" his voice was almost a whisper now. ""heroes endure because we need them. not for their own sakes. if will ..."" 
 ----- 
 ""you do not want to help us,"" will said to magnus. ""you do not want to position yourself as an enemy of mortmain's."" 
 ""well, can you blame him?"" woolsey rose in a whirl of yellow silk. ""what could you possibly have to offer that would make the risk worth it to him?"" 
 ""i will give you anything,"" said tessa in a low voice that will felt in his bones. ""anything at all, if you can help us help jem."" 
 magnus gripped a handful of his black hair. ""god, the two of you. i can make inquiries. track down some of the more unusual shipping routes. old molly --"" 
 ""i've been to her,"" will said. ""something's frightened her so badly she won't even crawl out of her grave."" 
 woolsey snorted. ""and that doesn't tell you anything, little shadowhunter? is it really worth all this, just to stretch your friend's life out another few months, another year? he will die anyway. and the sooner he dies, the sooner you can have his fiancee, the one you're in love with."" he cut his amused gaze toward tessa. ""really you ought to be counting down the days till he expires with great eagerness."" 
 who is this woolsey douchebag and where is he so i can shove my foot up his ass?! 
 swoon for jem 
 http://www.cassandraclare.com/my-writ... 
 the greatest scene ever from clockwork prince in jem's pov! 
 or i will freak out... 
 i am freaking out over the one little teaser from this book 
 and the gold of her ruined wedding dress. 
 who ruined her wedding dress!!! no! they better get married! aliens, hot aliens? daemon black???? yes please! 
 loved this book, read it in 2012 but decided to come back and write a review for it. this is actually the book that made me start book blogging! e.l. james runs out of ideas and desperately rewrites fifty shades of grey from christian's perspective. 
 stephenie meyers ""celebrates"" twilight by swapping genders but maintaining heteronormative ideals. 
 e.l. james rewrites fifty shades of grey but where they're all dalmatians this time. 
 stephenie meyers sets twilight in johannesburg 
 e.l. james makes fifty shades of paper dolls 
 ladies - it's time to cut the cord on this and write some new shit. leave the man alone, people! ""i know where you sleep, bard."" 
 she smirked. ""then you know i sleep with knives."" 
 * 
 it's hard to believe that a gathering of shadows comes out in less than three months!!!"," back when i was first published people made a lot of comparisons between me and scott lynch 
 the sentiment was mostly along the lines of ""pat rothfuss is the next scott lynch"" 
 here's the thing lies of lock lamora had come out almost exactly a year before my first book the name of the wind it was scott's first book the first in a fantasy series the world was gritty and real and it had knocked everyone over with how good it was 
 so i knew it was a flattering comparison but at the time i was kinda irked by it i remember thinking ""why do i have to be the next scott lynch why can't i just be the first pat rothfuss i'll probably be a lot better at that i've got way more experience at it if nothing else"" 
 years later i finally got around to reading lies and enjoyed it i saw that it was a clever book and gritty with a cool world and there was an orphan boy in it who was a witty mouthy thief a while after that i met scott and really liked him as well so i let go of what little residual irritation i had not that there was very much 
 fast forward to now this last week i started re-reading lies and i was absolutely fucking *stunned* by how good it is the construction of it the language the world the cleverness the wit 
 there is nothing i don't like in this book seriously okay fine one tiny *tiny* quibble 
 even so do you know how rare it is for me to say that right now in the full flush of this second reading i think lies is probably in e in my top ten favorite books ever maybe my top five 
 it's not really fair to compare the two books they're different styles different subjects different worlds 
 that said here's the things that the lies of locke lamora does better than the name of the wind 
 1 the beginning of his book is stronger than mine 
 seriously 50 pages into my book you'll have reached the point where someone is starting to actually tell a story 
 50 pages into lies you know the main character and are halfway into a fucking heist 
 2 his title is better than mine 
 don't get me wrong the name of the wind is a good title it's the *right* title for my book but ""the lies of lock lamora"" that's a faboo title right there 
 and his series title is better than mine too ""gentleman bastard"" beats ""kingkiller chronicles"" hands-down 
 3 his cussing is better than mine 
 not in real life in real life i cuss like a sailor but the language in my books is pretty genteel and tame 
 in lies lynch's low-life street thugs are vulgarian virtuosos this might seem like a little thing but it's not it builds the world it shows character it helps make the story feel truly perfectly grubby and real 
 here it is in a nutshell: when i was first published i was irritated when people compared me to scott lynch only now do i realize how huge a compliment i was being given 
 if you haven't read it you should if you have read it you should probably read it again ok wow where do i even begin with this 
 my summarized thoughts are that this was a waste of my time i've seen a lot of reviews where people say this read like fanfiction and they would be correct because this is fanfiction jk rowling did not write this i will repeat jk rowling did not write this 
 with that cleared up this shouldn't exist the play was not meant to be read like this it was meant to be seen if they wanted a book they should have made a novelized version but instead they took the easy way out and on top of that as a script it was horrible it's an insult to call this the 8th harry potter book 
 things i liked: 
 -scorpius is a beautiful ray of sunshine and does not deserve to be associated with this nonsense 
 specific things i didn't like 
 -so many of the characters said and did things that didn't feel genuine to them 
 -ron was pretty much a joke (and i never really cared for him before) but he was basically just there to add comical background noise 
 -voldemort has a daughter areyouserious 
 -thinking about voldemort procreating makes me want to vomit 
 -the timer turner plot was ridiculous 
 -and also so convenient everything got wrapped up in a neat little bow 
 -scorpius has a crush on rose ok suuuuure whatever you say 
 -albus and scorpius are gay and in love i will fight you on that 
 -harry being a horrible father and saying it was because he didn't have a father figure to learn from what ummmmm hagird sirius lupin why don't you just spit on their graves while you're at it harry 
 one star for the beauty that is scorpius malfoy zero stars for everything else 
 would i recommend this no 
 i am off to return this and get my money back it was alright it was just alright 
 i know i gave this 4 stars but to be honest jk rowling can write a dictionary with harry potter illustrations and i'd probably give it 4 stars so my rating is almost irrelevant here given my extreme bias 
 the thing is it was cute it was sweet it was entirely nostalgic to see the old crew again but i hated the play format as a person who grew up with harry potter and who is in her early 30s now i feel like i grew up with harry potter and the crew and with the advent of this book i have in fact grown old with them it was lovely to see them again it was like meeting old friends 
 i don't feel old i'm a more responsible person for sure but i feel young at heart when we're young adulthood responsibilities just the prospect of adulting seem so dauntingthen one gets there and it's like well i'm as immature as i ever was i love fun as much as i ever did growing old isn't that bad and seeing the old crew being as much as they ever were brings joy into my not-yet-old-and-grizzled-heart 
 i could do without the kids to be honest oh sure they're little potter and granger-weasley spawns but come on nobody ever has and nobody ever will win me over as much as their parents whom i have loved the instant we met them on the hogwarts express 
 (ok maybe not ron) 
 but i digress the kids aren't all bad i rather like little scorpius actually 
 scorpius: and it's just like my father's i got his nose his hair and his name not that that's a great thing either i mean -- father-son issues i have them but on the whole i'd rather be a malfoy than you know the son of the dark lord 
 the adults have grown they've changed some have changed so much that i hardly recognize them draco for instance i like that he's well nicer now but he doesn't feel like draco you know i've been so used to harry and draco doing this 
 that it's rather discombobulating to see anything otherwise 
 but yeah characters are great but the format the format 
 i don't even know it's fair of me to judge this based on the fact that i don't like that it's a play because for fuck's sakes it's a play like what did i expect this may be the most confusing review i've ever written i just don't like the play format it's meant for the stage that means it's up to the skill of the actors to portray what is implied it's up to the audience to interpret nuances it is almost entirely based on dialogue and i hate that i miss rowling's writing i love rowling's writing and i wanted more of it the play brings up so many things that could have been written so much more had it been expanded into a book format the children's growing pains particular that of young albus harry's feelings as a parent draco's struggles with who he was and who he is furthermore ron is relegated to little more than comic relief let's be honest i never liked the guy but for him to be much of the same character that he ever was conjures up the image of the try-hard middle-aged dude and i know that ron is more than that 
 i like it i don't like it i don't know but i would certainly relish watching it on the stage if i ever had the chance it's bound to be better than on paper with acol hitting shelves this month i guess it's time to finally mark it as readi don't know what else to say except i've never been prouder of a book and i really hope my readers enjoy the end of this journey okay so the good things: i liked the world/mythology/etc and was amused by the anne rice reference and i also liked the subtle pro-gay marriage message 
 it could have actually been a lot of fun except for the romance part which went like this: (spoilers) 
 diana: i am exceptionally good at being a historian of science and i even have a job at yale i am also a witch but i don't use my powers much 
 gosh this mysterious manuscript sure is mysterious 
 matthew: i am tall i went through your papers and then came to your house and watched you sleep 
 also i'm an ancient vampire 
 diana: um okay 
 matthew: say would you like to do some vampire yoga with me 
 that is not a euphemism by the way 
 diana: i guess so i could do that after i go rowing and then run several miles 
 matthew: i have a lot of useful information that i'm not going to tell you 
 also you smell amazing i can barely control myself when you're around 
 diana: oh well i'm sure it's fine 
 matthew: i forbid you to do various things 
 also your life is in danger so we're going to visit my mom in france did i mention i'm french 
 diana: hey for serious you can't just tell me what to do all the time 
 matthew: i am coldly furious 
 also it makes me sad when you disobey me and i hate being sad 
 you know what i was sad once a thousand years ago and then i killed a bunch of people and then it happened this other time and i killed my lover just so you know 
 diana: oh right silly me so wilful anyway should we have sex now 
 matthew: what why would we do that 
 matthew: oh by the way this is my housekeeper 
 she is also an ancient vampire but for some reason i guess she likes keeping house 
 housekeeper: oh hi here is some herbal tea make sure to drink it every day and don't make any mistakes when you brew it um because it might taste bad not that it's having any effect on you without your knowledge or anything like that 
 diana: gosh thanks everyone is so nice here 
 matthew: your eyes are like starlight now 
 diana: i love you 
 matthew: hang on i need to go back to england for something 
 matthew: i am back from england i love you

 the end this book cost me around 600 dollars 
 when i'm traveling to and from conventions i use the airplane time to catch up on my reading a lot of times this means i'm taking the opportunity to read books that have been popular for a while but that i haven't gotten around to i feel like i should be aware of the landscape 
 anyway on my way home from seattle i had a layover in minneapolis i grabbed this book so i'd have something to read while i was eating dinner in the airport 
 so i ate dinner and i read the book and i lost track of time and i missed my plane 
 i ended up having to rent a car and drive the three and a half hours back to stevens point

 loved this book 
 a very detailed review will be up on my channel later this week :) spoilery book discussion here - https://wwwyoutubecom/watchv=l_gl7 
 this was absolutely everything i wanted and never knew i needed thank you sarah for this perfect beautiful book 
 here are some of my spoiler-free impressions: 
 dorian precious cinnamon roll i can't 
 aelin queen of shadows more like queen of slaying yasssss get it girl 
 rowan i'm screaming 
 chaol more screaming 
 aedion lysandra manon arobynn 
 i had about twelve heart attacks while reading this book it was awesome this book was outstanding i don't even understand how sjm was able to make this jump from book one i mean this book is leagues above the first in this series 
 damn 
 damn 
 so good so this book is coming out on the 28th of october just two weeks away and i'm growing increasingly nervous 
 this isn't an unusual thing authors are always anxious before the release of a book we worry if people will like it we worry about the publisher being satisfied with the sales we worry about the translations being good 
 i am all those types of worried but i have other worries too 
 one of my biggest concerns is that despite my best efforts to spread the word people will pick this book up thinking it's book three (it's not) if that happens they can't help but be disappointed if you take a drink expecting milk and get orange juice instead you're going to be unhappy it doesn't matter how good the orange juice is it's shocking and unpleasant 
 equally troubling to me is the thought that people will see this book and think ""oh i've heard of that rothfuss guy maybe i'll try him out"" 
 and then they'll pick up this book and start reading and it won't make one damn bit of sense to them because they don't have any idea who auri is because this story is about her this is auri's book 
 for all these reasons i wrote my first ever author's foreword i expected my editor to cut it but she didn't and when i asked her if i could share it here she said i could 
 so here it is 
 * * * 
 you might not want to buy this book 
 i know that's not the sort of thing an author is supposed to say the marketing people aren't going to like this my editor is going to have a fit but i'd rather be honest with you right out of the gate 
 first if you haven't read my other books you don't want to start here 
 my first two books are the name of the wind and the wise man's fear if you're curious to try my writing start there they're the best introduction to my world this book deals with auri one of the characters from that series without the context of those books you're probably going to feel pretty lost 
 second even if you have read my other books i think it's only fair to warn you that this is a bit of a strange story i don't go in for spoilers but suffice to say that this one is different it doesn't do a lot of the things a classic story is supposed to do and if you're looking for a continuation of kvothe's storyline you're not going to find it here 
 on the other hand if you'd like to learn more about auri this story has a lot to offer if you love words and mysteries and secrets if you're curious about the underthing and alchemy if you want to know more about the hidden turnings of my world 
 well then this book might be for you i have never wanted so badly for the characters in a book to be real i want to meet them all the way i want to meet the president or taylor swift 
 this story is perfectly told it is perfectly paced it is brilliantly written it is beautifully crafted 
 andy weir does this incredible thing where he make the reader feel the isolation that mark wagner feels and he does it so subtly we don't even realize that he's doing it until it's done 
 the martian completely captivated me i couldn't wait to find out what happened next and i never wanted it to end i wrote this book so i'm probably biased since it's early and the full jacket copy isn't out here's a list of things in adsom: 
 -magic 
 -cross-dressing thieves 
 -(aspiring) pirates 
 -londons (plural) 
 -sadistic kings (and queens) 
 -a royal who is equal parts prince harry and jack harkness 
 -more magic (blood magic elemental magic bad magic etc etc) 
 -epic magicky fights scenes 
 -angst 
 -and coats with more than two sides how to write popular ya supernatural literature and defile your spirit 
 based on the popular ya novel evermore and aided by countless more like it i have compiled an easy to read and follow list of rules for writing a popular series and being able to sell out your soul at the same time does that sound too convenient well it's unbelievably easy to do if you follow my quick and easy program 
 1 create an 'outcast' heroine 
 it's important that your primarily female teenage audience can relate to your main character so whilst you can't have your main character associate herself with being cool it still has to be obvious to your audience that she totally is now meyer's approach of the goose-turned swan-but was really still a goose bella associated herself as 'different' and a 'loner' only to arrive at her new school and be immediately popular and accepted by almost everyone noel's method is different yet in a similar spirit her protagonist ever was incredibly popular at her old school and has decided to be an outcast because she feels that she can't be accepted due to her psychic gift she also has the ability to perceive someone's personality through the colours that define them so instead of aligning herself with the shallow mean and popular crowd she aligns herself with the shallow and mean loners 
 it's very important for your protagonists to be 'different' because today's youth despise the sheep mentality and so they all strive to be unique since they're all different in almost the exact same way it is relatively easy to emulate this with as little effort put into characterization as possible in your female protagonist 
 as long as she shows no regard for her clothing appearance or any kind of interest in giving a shit about anyone but herself she will easily pass with young audiences it will be her ewniqueness that eventually draws the perfect hero to her as opposed to any of the usual elements such as: looks hygiene personality or determinable interest in the world outside their own arse 
 please also remember that she probably should be a reader preferably of wuthering heights or romeo and juliet and that she should consider everyone around her to have inferior intelligence despite the fact that her reading repertoire extends to only a couple of books 
 a noticeably absent family is necessary and a completely dead family makes for a better story because then she actually has a perceived reason to be a moody antisocial self-absorbed little bitch do this even though in all likelihood she would be all of the above with a perfectly normal family 
 2 create a perfect hero 
 it is very important that your hero be perfect in almost every regard unlike the female protagonist who can disregard her appearance he must not only be more attractive than a gq model without any of the effort put into his appearance but he must also be thoughtful intelligent and mysterious 
 in no way is he to reflect almost every teenage boy to have ever existed and he must have no desire to find a partner for himself who is in anyway comparable in looks kindness intelligence or perfection 
 if he is a vampire or some such immortal then he must be ridiculously wealthy if he is a werewolf then he is allowed to be poor but must make up for it with incredible bedroom skills 
 he needn't have a personality that extends beyond mysterious sexy and in love with the female protagonist naturally in this respect meyers mead marr and stiefvater are something like overachievers - but if noel saintcrow clare kate and fitzpatrick are any indication then we need know little more about the hero other than the fact that he's gorgeous has a secret and is in love history friends likes dislikes family passions interests hobbies and personality flaws are all negligible information that is taking up precious space in your novel especially when you could be injecting more drooling from the female protagonist in place of any kind of characterization for your hero 
 your book will sell better if the hero stalks follows obsesses over and actively pursues the heroine beyond any realm of believability you could triple your audience just by having him watch her sleep 
 3 create useless friends 
 it's important to reiterate to the young adult generation that nobody other than the hero is important since domestic abuse begins with one partner manoeuvring the other to have limited contact with anyone else we must strive to normalize this in literature thus the female protagonist shouldn't have anyone close enough to her that she can't break contact or eventually forget about them it's very important that her full focus socialization and all of her needs are eventually devoted or met by the male protagonist 
 to aid this her friends must be selfish vain crazy slutty uncaring or in other ways undeserving of the heroine's attentions and affections it's very important that she never call them on their poor damaging and graceless friendship but must lovingly worry about them for the minimal amount of time acceptable to the reader before once again completely focusing on the mysterious hero 
 4 mix in a twisted convoluted plot designed entirely to provide dramatic and sexy subplot 
 it's important that the plot no matter how unlikely must revolve around the hero saving the heroine the villains do not necessarily need to have realistic or conceivable motivations for their actions as long as the hero gets to save the day at least three or four times then your book will be profitable 
 please remember that the actual plot of your story needn't truly begin until at least 350 pages into your story the longer you can stall any interesting event occuring the less thinking you will actually need to do 
 plus - for free - extras to help 'improve' your novel the bottom line of your sales and the expedient destruction of your soul 
 -how to create a senseless mythology 
 mythology is more of a concept rather than something that needs to be respected or honoured vampires don't need to refrain from daylight and angels no longer need to ""fall"" for good they can now be redeemed like us the good news is that creating your own mythology disregarding anything written before allows you to twist and bastardize the plot beyond any recognizably interesting concept 
 -explanations as to why research could actually damage your profit 
 research takes time energy and intelligence why do it you've got ten fingers (presumably) and an attention span that extends past anything that could be compared to a gnat (even if it is only barely) simply make it up as you go for example: ever is psychic research may tell us that this has something to do with receiving visions of the future or possibly commnicating with ghosts yet research is boring instead she is imbued with the following powers that we guess can kind of be put under a psychic umbrella if we force enough information and logic out of our brains first: mind reading visions of near-present and future personal life knowledge of any person she physically touches seeing ghosts seeing auras literary osmosis from touching any written object drawing the answers from any written question placed before her and any other supernatural abilities that seem convenient at the time 
 -detailed observations on why the deus ex machina rocks 
 tying together a plot even if you work to keep it as non-complicated or infantile as possible is hard it's much easier to ignore tying together a number of plot points in any believable fashion and instead rely on some deus ex machina to come in and take care of thoughtful planning for you 
 -how to expand one nonsensical idea into a series and why this is more profitable than originality 
 last but not least ensure that your story is somewhat open ended so that you can create a series out of it research shows that people even if they are intelligent enough to see that you're writing is becoming progressively shittier and nonsensical will often still purchase books in the series in order to find out what happens so rather than creating a new story with new characters simply beat the same old horse (it needn't really be a horse - simply a pile of shit that's been forced into a horse-like shape) for at least three or more books in order to squeeze every last cent out of the franchise that you can

 april 2017 - reread in prep for acowar glorious thrilling and completely enthralling -- acowar was everything i hoped for and then some this is how you end a series -- with love and hope and happiness painting the grand finale maas deserves thunderous applause yet again 
 review to come well it's done and it's been a long time coming 
 back in late 2009 i finally got the book to the point where i was satisfied with it it was an okay book it was a book that if i had to publish it i knew it wouldn't embarrass me 
 by may 2010 i'd re-written the book to the point where i was happy with it it was a good book it was a book i was pleased with 
 by my final deadline in november 2010 i'd revised things to the point where i was excited about it it was a great book it was finally a book i was proud of 
 i'm glad my editor gave me enough time for this i'm glad i have a book i'm excited to have on the shelves 
 i hope when it comes out on march first you enjoy it it was a long time coming this first part was originally written in 2012 
 jesus the book isn't even out yet and you guys are trashing it already seriously wait at least until it comes out read it and then give your opinion right now it's just useless and pissing all of us fans off she's not milking this if she really just wanted more money she wouldn't work so hard on all of this beautiful material she's creating for us for us she doesn't have to do this she could be working as a doctor or a lawyer and making money and if you think those two jobs are harder and that writing is easier you're 100% wrong it's not easy it's hard as hell but she does it and she does it beautifully it's even harder to get published and get enough books sold do your research before you go around calling people cash cows we've all got to make a living some people do it by working at jobs that they absolutely hate and some like ms clare do it by sticking with what they're passionate about so what if she makes money her books are amazing and if you don't like them that's fine but it's rude to trash talk a series that isn't even written yet in fact it's rude to trash talk anything but the least you could do is hold off until you have something to trash talk 
 ---- 
 oh my god i knew this book would be amazing and it was so freaking amazing 
 cassandra clare you have done it yet again you've managed to make me care so much about characters i just met and made me feel their happiness pain sadness as if it were my own i was so sad when i saw the last page and then the last conversation really really gah 
 i really hope that the people who were trash talking have read it and been stunned she created yet another beautiful masterpiece and i was more than happy to spend money on it i need more as always after reading something by sanderson i find myself irritated at how good he is 
 so let's take it as a given that the book has all the essential ingredients: character plot dialogue mystery and action all of these things are there some of them merely great most of them included to exceptional degree 
 what truly impresses me though is that sanderson has done something extraordinarily unique with this book something that just isn't done in fantasy 
 first sanderson wrote the mistborn trilogy an amazingly good fantasy trilogy set it in a unique carefully-constructed world with a well defined magic system 
 then he moved that world forward 300 years he evolved it away from the low-industrial/dark-ages culture into a much more modern setting 
 this simply isn't done 
 you see here's the way things work: 
 1 you either write secondary world fantasy which is pretty medievally or renaissance-y or occationally dark-ages-ish maybe you go crazy and make it kinda asian or you make it bronze age that's rare though pretty fringe 
 2 your other option is to set something in this world most of the time when you do this the setting is modern which gets you urban fantasy if you're not quite so modern you get steampunk if you go back further than that it's alternate history but again that's kinda rare 
 these are the rules they're not written down anywhere but generally speaking that's how things work this is just the way things are done 
 but sanderson has done something different here two somethings actually 
 1 he evolved his world through time changing the society significantly while staying true to the world he established in the earlier mistborn books 
 (yeah yeah there have been a few other authors that have done this frank herbert for example but it's so rare as to be practically unique and in my opinion sanderson has done it better than herbert did for the simple fact that i want to read sanderson's future books in this world while i just couldn't make it through the second dune sequel) 
 2 sanderson has written urban fantasy that isn't set in this world call it what you want urban fantasy qua-western steampunk whatever that's what he did 
 i read this book and found myself thinking ""what you can do that how come nobody's done this before"" 
 this is what happens with all truly clever innovation once someone does it it seems obvious it seems like anyone could do it 
 but everyone didn't do it sanderson did that's a very special sort of clever 
 what's my point 
 my point is that this book is good and you should give it a try 
 my other point is that this book does something different and pulls it off very smoothly so you should give it a try 
 my last point is that sanderson has now been added to a very short list of authors specifically the list authors whom i wish to kill so that i might eat their livers and thereby gain their power 
 so yeah my hat's off to you brandon watch your back you know i really hadn't foreseen the publication of something to lengthen harry potter's story after the conclusion that was harry potter and the deathly hallows 
 so the way i see it harry potter and the cursed child is a lovely gift to every harry potter fan out there who has hoped and waited a long time to see their wizard friends again 
 though the plot holes are very visible and spread throughout the story they make for charming and heartfelt conversations between characters so i didn't mind them all that much 
 the best thing about this #8 harry potter is how nostalgic it makes the reader feel there are plenty of familiar faces - harry ginny draco hermione ron dumbledore etc - as well as some interesting new ones - albus rose scorpius lily james 
 admittedly it was strange to read this supposedly 8th story in harry potter's world in play format but the truth is it was extremely easy to imagine everything play out like in a movie so it all felt alive to me 
 this isn't a book you have to read but if you're a diehard harry potter fan i am going to look at you quite incredulously if you decide not to i'm sadly not going to be able to tell you that you're making the right choice because this is so so charming and fun but i can understand people wanting to have their own vision of the harry potter cast as adults and their children yes it's a bit silly but i loved it still 
 blog | youtube | twitter | instagram | google+ | bloglovin' one of my favorite books of the year i feel like i can't say much because of spoilers but i love the characters i love the story i love the romance i just love it all 
 *re-read april 2017 this book totally wrecked me in the best possible way (because iaeur(tm)m thrilled to cry for a day straight idk) first of all the scope of this story is extraordinary events from the first half that seemed so important at the time now feel like minuscule details in the face of this epic plot 
 i love how maas writes such complex characters who have had their lives shattered in a variety of ways yet still keep fighting for each other and work to create a new life with the family they chose feyreaeur(tm)s growth from the first book where she had such low self-worth is beyond inspirational as she finds the ability to completely forgive & love herself and everything sheaeur(tm)s been sheaeur(tm)s still a flawed character who makes some sketchy calls and is continually healing and that's what i love most about this book: every single character is broken and healing lucien elain nesta cassian azriel mor rhys amren even tamlin everyone and the amount they care about each other is just 
 maas manages to juggle a wide range of characters in this book add in even more and find really creative ways to show whataeur(tm)s happening with other ships besides rhys & feyre i think if you look at this as just a conclusion to the trilogy then a lot of storylines are kind of underwhelming because it's mostly setting up potential for future books with a lot of the side characters but i was just excited for any page time for cassian nesta elain and azriel 
 i also loved how everyone finds a different way to be strong (like in ways besides brute strength) and the story actually shows the horrors of war without glorifying killing thereaeur(tm)s a theme of the choices & consequences of war and how one life can change the world: it occurred to me today when i sat down to write a review of this book that i've never gone into detail about my dresden files obsession online 
 that said it's certainly there in bits and pieces pretty obvious for anyone who is willing to read between the lines 
 and i've talked about my love for the series in public many many times usually in response to the question ""so what are your favorite books"" or ""what should i read while i'm waiting for book three to come out"" 
 but i've never really stated the depth of my love plainly all in one place for all the world to see 
 so 
 the dresden files is my favorite series ever i say that both as a writer and a reader 
 think about that for a moment i don't make statements like that casually 
 as a series dresden trumps out everything else i've ever read or am currently reading that includes books i *overflow* with love for like lynch's gentleman bastard series or robin hobb's farseer or sanderson's mistborn or abercrombie's first law 
 i like the dresden files more than i like wizard of earthsea more than i like zelazny's chronicles of amber more than gaiman's sandman more the lord of the rings 
 as a series the dresden files even beats out pratchett's discworld there i said it 
 i love these books so much that when ghost story came out i read the *entire* series starting at book one so i would be ready for the newest book 
 then when cold days came out i read the *entire* series again 
 that's something i haven't done since high school i don't have time for that shit nevertheless i did it 
 for this book skin game i would probably have done the same thing again but this time my obsession went even further i decided to viciously abuse my meager power as an author i contacted jim's editor and begged for an advance reading copy 
 she graciously gave me one probably because the intensity of my request frightened her plus nobody wants to see a big beardy man cry it's just not an appealing thing 
 so what did i think of this book i loved it 
 i won't spoil anything i don't go in for that sort of thing 
 i'll just say that i loved it it's everything i'd hoped for and that jim made me cry like four goddamn times in this book 
 you're walking a thin line butcher i'd hate you if i didn't love you so much ughhhhh i neeeeddd morrrreeeeee ""graceling meets selection"" whatever marketing team came up with that tag for this series clearly never read the book red queen is game of thrones with katniss as the mockingjay with x-men in a tantalizing ya twist of magical perfection 
 three quotes that summarize this series spoiler-free: 
 ""anyone can betray anyone"" meet the lannisters silver court and their current royal family 
 ""make no mistake my girl you are playing the game as someone's pawn"" 
 ""i am a fool"" 
 sooooooooo my initial reaction: 
 i have to wait another year let me repeat: i have to wait another year 
 yeaaaaa i'm totally cool with that not 
 okay now before i go all crazy fan girl let me start by saying that no one and i repeat no one had higher expectations for this than me (well maaaaybe victoria:d) i am the world's biggest medieval/dystopian ya fantasy nut & i have been looking for a book like this my whole life my whole life people so it isn't a high stretch of imagination to say with all the hype i was expecting to be let down because let's face it: most of the hype let's you down (thank you million dollar marketing campaigns for all the *cough cough* next-big-things) 
 (and in case you are wondering i never wanted to read hunger games or harry potter so while those blew my mind in a totally awesome way they were never really on my tbr to begin with red queen on the other hand has been a book i thought i would love from the beginning) 
 and then the hype got bigger: 
 reviewers i follow and love start saying magical words like ""shatter me"" ""darkling"" and ""x-men-like powers"" 
 so this was me one minute before midnight when red queen released: 
 and guess what it beat my over-hyped up imagination this book is now one of my favorites of all time red queen is everything a ya medieval fantasy should be i loved every minute of it 
 alright now to my actual thoughts on this book i marked the whole thing as a spoiler because i am lazy but yea trust me when i say you don't want this ruined (so read on at your own peril): 
 1 ""little lightning girl"" okay yea the way they use her reminded me a lot of mockingjay not going to lie 
 2 cal - shame on you you hot beautiful prince you you were totally scamming and making move's on your brother's girl i know you are supposed to come off as this nice guy but before maven turned out to be evil i seriously did not like you i mean i was totally rooting for you and mare (*gasps that dance scene*) but i was mad at you for being the popular/likable guy when you were totally secretly making eyes at your brother's wife that you know he's falling for that said i still loved your romance scenes and i do like you i will admit to my sickness 
 3 maven maven maven maven hello darkling meets joffrey kind of like malfoy with a heart y'all know that scene in harry potter i'm talking about: 
 so needless to say i am secretly in love with him because i am shameless and always root for the complicated guy and/or villain love interest 
 #teamwarnerdarklingmorpheusjacedamonsalvatoredaemonblack -and now maven 
 4 this book totally has a love triangle (maybe more you can never tell with the childhood friend what's-his-name) but strangely enough i enjoyed it it played out to my guilty pleasure side if maven wasn't in this book i would totally be in love with cal and vice versa i loved them both the only other time i have loved both guys in a love triangle was cassandra clare's infernal devices series (and even then i still obviously preferred will but i was definitely okay with both) 
 5 there were definite cliches/overused tropes: 
 ""you're going to be his brother's wife and he's going to war"" 
 ""i am the little lightning girl and i am going to make the world change"" 
  but i was down with them because tropes & cliches are there for a reason we all secretly love them we just don't love them when the writing sucks 
 only trope i hated: the instalove with cal & mare i was cool with it until (i apologize for the rant) this happened: 
 maven shakes his head ""he [cal] will always choose you"" 
 >> really yea he liked her but now everyone was suddenly ""cal will choose you over his country"" umm no that part annoyed me to no end because while i was down with instalike i was not down with instalove (and i did not interpret cal as that much of an idiot) thank the gods that turned out not to be true it's cool that cal hesitated but if he had actually chosen mare i would have lost respect for him instead i gained so much more for him standing up to her and turning her in way to go cal 
 6 the brother shade wtf why didn't the guard tell her about him if he was still alive that twist annoyed me they didn't suspect maven so they had no reason to keep it a secret maybe i missed something but that was the only plot hole of the book and honestly it was so small i didn't care 
 7 queen elara (enough said): ""like any wife she hates her husband for challenging her and like any queen she hates the power the king holds over her"" 
 now onto my favorite scene let's be honest: it was everyone's we all knew a big twist was coming but it was still so epic and helloooo darkling aka maven i knew you were more than just your brother's shadow 
 ""he rolls his shoulders cracking his bones to chase away an ache his motions are sluggish and strange and when he settles back on his feet hands on hips i feel like i'm seeing him for the first time his eyes are so cold"" 
 the queen was way too much of a biatch to just stand on the sidelines with the most awesome power (whisper) of all 
 ""because she already knew because he is her son because this was her plan all along"" 
 when malfoy/joffrey listened to cersei lannister maven listened to his mother i had this image in my head: 
 followed by a wish that mare had her powers back to do this: 
 i loved every minute of this book guys read it now i literally bookmarked every single page and not just the maven parts guys all of it 
 and finally my favorite line of the whole book: 
 ""this was the shadow controlling the flame"" 
 yea i know i'm #teammaven i know you are all #teamcal hence i leave you with this: 
 omg i cannot wait for the next book 'crap my astronaut crewmates accidentally left me behind on mars i'm fucked i'm going to die oh wait i just thought of something highly logically unlikely and technically complicated that i am sure to pull off without a hitch because did i mention that i am plucky and ingenious it sure is a good thing that i am super-talented yay that worked i'm not dead [next chapter] but wait disaster has struck shit happens when you're stuck alone on mars whatever shall i do omg i just had a great idea it's a good thing i'm so naturally optimistic because it sure would make for a bummer book if i ever showed any signs of being depressed or having any kind of mental deterioration after spending nearly two years in total solitude nah i've got the fightin' spirit i can create a life support system out of duct tape what does mars actually look like is there anything interesting from a scientific perspective about it who cares i'm busy growing potatoes in shit and watching three's company did i mention that disco sucks' 
 repeat 
 for a while 
 i do not get the hype this was amazing it was exactly what i wanted from a series finale--epic intense emotional and satisfying just like with the previous books i loved the world the characters the story and the writing this is one of my favorite series of all time and i'm so so happy with this beautiful conclusion 
 if you like sci-fi fairy tale retellings or you just want to read an epic & satisfying series--you need the lunar chronicles in your life just i cant yes this book bless this book that ending damn i can't even type in complete sentences after reading glass sword (even though i just did) little indian boy goes on weird boat ride with mean cat i finished this book with tears in my eyes and laughter on my lips 
 just wow excellent book nervous but also so excited to return to this story these people this world 
 lest anyone assume that i'm simply capitalizing on vicious's success a note: 
 from the beginning vicious was in my mind a series called the villains ideally one with 3 parts: 
 vicious vengeful and victorious 
 but publishing is a business and vicious was my first adult genre title and a seemingly niche one at that the publisher and i both wanted it to be able to stand alone so that if it didn't sell well enough to merit a sequel readers wouldn't feel cheated or abandoned i've always preferred writing books in a series with their own contained arcs so it worked for me but it was always my hope if not my expectation to continue the books 
 i'm sure there are readers out there who would prefer vicious to stand alone and it can simply don't read the subsequent volumes ;) but for those who want more of victor and eli and the rest of the villainous crew read on this book is the result of bella swan being thrown into a fantasy world and trying to be katniss everdeen she did not succeed 
 ok more review: 
 i genuinely really enjoyed some aspects of this book but i couldn't stand feyre or tamlin or anybody really except for lucien i feel like lucien was the only character who had an interesting back story and he was just a much better presence than either of the main characters 
 but the instalove the instalove guys it kills me also verrrrry problematic scenes like when it was feyre's fault for almost getting raped can you not ""go back to your room feyre before i do something bad to you"" wow whoa really not cool 
 on top of all that i just found the plot to be incredibly boring i started getting interested around the 200-page mark but then it all just went back to being uninteresting again i know in a status update i said that the book was slow but what i should have said is that it was boring because there is a huge difference a book can be fast-paced and still be boring and vice versa i love slow-paced books have you seen how much i loved the name of the wind and the game of thrones books those are slow but not boring this was boring 
 that's how i felt anyway it's my opinion if you weren't bored by this book that's awesome however i will never lie to you about my opinion so here we are let's play a little game of: 
 who am i 
 -my book starts with me moving to a new location and starting at a new school 
 -i live with just my dad but don't worry about him he's not important in fact you'll barely notice he exists at all 
 -i quickly make friends at my new school i'm not sure why everyone likes me i'm not remotely interesting 
 -i've never had a boyfriend before meeting my love interest and for some reason people at my school find that hard to believe 
 -as soon as my love interest catches my eye i can't get him out of my mind he's the mysterious type but he only has eyes for me he quickly becomes my boyfriend and we fall deeply in love *swoon* 
 -my boyfriend happens to have a sibling who simply adores me how could she not i'm so awesome she has a super special sight too ps her name starts with an ""a"" 
 -my b-b-boyfriend---sorry that was me swooning again; he's so super howt *giggle*---also has another sibling that doesn't seem to like me at first they are always glaring at me it unnerves me but i can get through anything with my boy toy by my side oh and ps their name starts with an ""r"" 
 -my boyfriend just happens to save my life with his mysterious powers at first when i confront him about it he plays it off it really upsets me it just wasn't fair 
 -he later tells me that he can't stay away from me any longer and soon after he takes me to his home to really introduce me to his family 
 -i find out he's been stalking me for a while but it doesn't bother me i find it incredibly romantic 
 -*psst* if my boyfriend and i were to have a baby it would be some strange half-breed child 
 -randomly out of nowhere i'm kidnapped by a tracker i'm not sure where he came from because this book is all about me and my one true love 
 -when i'm not hanging out with my boyfriend or getting abducted i can be found brushing my teeth eating cereal doing homework or cooking for my dad oh and i hate being the center of attention i'm so selfless 
 -by the end of my book i end up in the hospital 
 sowho am i 
 if you guessed bella swan you are correct but if you guessed megan rosenberg you are also correct don't bother looking up to the top of the screen this is indeed a carrier of the mark review or as i like to call it twilight 20 or better yet carrier of the twilight or twi-remix or twilight goes to ireland or or orokay you get the picture and no i'm not kidding all the above actually happens in this book 
 i feel like i need to start saying how sorry i am to leigh fallon truly i am you see i'm in the middle of re-reading the twilight series and as a result i am hyperaware of the twi-likeness this book has i was really eager to get my hands on carrier of the mark but you have no idea how disappointed i am in this book so it is with a heavy heart that i review twilight carrier of the mark again 
 seventeen-year-old bella swan megan rosenberg moves to forks ireland after her dad charlie caleb accepts and new position at a yacht club on her first day at school she notices a mysterious boy named edward cullen adam deris staring at her she literally cannot stop thinking about him for the rest of the book i'm not going to retell the book here but if you've read twilight just sprinkle on a little air bender add a pinch of captain planet and toss a creepy baby on top and you pretty much have the recipe for carrier of the mark instead i'm going to be pulling a few select quotes with commentary pour moi 
 adam randomly confesses his feelings to megan after have several staring contests: 
 they told me from the very beginning that it wasn't safe to 'consort'"" he said slightly wincing at the word ""with you but i'm not strong enough to stay away"" 
 now where have i heard that before 
 twilight: 
 he heard the change in my tone his eyes tightened ""i don't seem to be strong enough to stay away from you"" 
 a little pda action: 
 i put my hand on adam's face and felt along his cheek and down along his jaw reveling in the softness of his skin in comparison to the light stubble he closed his eyes 
 ""you have no idea how good that feels"" he murmured 
 that sounds so familiar 
 twilight: 
 ""do you mind"" i asked for he had closed his eyes again 
 ""no"" he said without opening his eyes ""you can't imagine how that feels"" he sighed 
 i lightly trailed my hand over the perfect muscles of his arm followed the faint pattern of bluish veins inside the crease at his elbow 
 rosalie rian doesn't like megan at first: 
 ""rian has a tough time accepting who we are and our purposei think he's just finding it hard to accept that you would opt in when you have the chance to walk away"" 
 now who had the same issue 
 twilight: 
 he sighed deeply ""rosalie struggles the most with with what we are it's hard for her to have someone on the outside know the truth and she's a little jealousyou're human"" he shrugged ""she wishes that she were too"" 
 there is a tracker following megan: 
 it's been years since we have even seen a tracker in ireland"" 
 ""is that what the guy in the theater was a tracker"" 
 ""i think so we can't be sure at the moment but he fits the usual profile there's something different this time though; he's getting around our defenses we just don't know how he's doing it"" 
 funny that's just who was following bella too 
 twilight: 
 ""he's a tracker alice did you see that he's a tracker"" 
 love interest serching for a way to protect heroine from the tracker: 
 ""don't apologize i hate to see you hurting like that please believe me when i tell you that i will make you safe"" 
 didn't edward promise the same thing in a very similar situation 
 twilight: 
 ""soon as soon as i possibly can i will make you safe first"" his voice was hard 
 a bad guy was snooping around megan's room and house adam has his family guarding her but somehow they manage to slip through: 
 ""someone was in her room for christ's sake in her room"" 
 ""but i don't think he was still there when megan got home if he had been he would have acted right then and there i'd say her mark was sensing that he'd been there earlier"" 
 rian shook his head ""how is he getting around our senses we've always known when the knox are close this is bad"" 
 can't seem to put my finger on itoh wait i can 
 twilight (eclipse): 
 ""he was in her room alice he could have still been there -- waiting for her"" 
 ""i would have seen that"" 
 edward threw his hands up in exasperation ""really you're sure"" alice's voice was cold when she answered ""you've already got me watching the volturis' decisions watching for victoria's return watching bella's every step you want to add another do i just have to watch charlie or bella's room or the house or the whole street too edward if i try to do too much things are going to start slipping through the cracks"" 
 shitdamn 
 oh but the similarities don't end there right after adam reveals his feelings to megan the very next day he takes her to meet his family and if you remember that is exactly what edward did after he revealed all his feelings to bella in the meadow scene (confessions chapter 13) aine alice adam's sister also has a ""sight"" fionn carlisle is adam's adoptive father adam admitted to stalking megan just like edward did to bella megan confides in her best friend caitlin in math class what do you know that's the same place bella confided with jessica at both adam and edward's eyes change color (interestingly both share the same original color: green) 
 i just couldn't get past all the twilight references i'm honestly baffled at how this book got published with all the shocking similarities because carrier of the mark reads just like a twilight fan-fic and not a good one i'd give this book a freakin' ""a+"" for following the ""twilight book disaster"" recipe to the t but an all around ""f"" (fail) for ya literature i went though several different emotions while reading this book: shock disbelief finally settling on anger anger yes did the author sit with her editor over tea and crumpets with their twilight copies on their laps pulling plots quotes and carbon copies of the characters did they really think no one would pick up on the similarities well i'll tell you something my twilight copy is open on my lap right now and i am not amused one bit this is something i expect from the usual offender cassie clare not a debut ya author and man i feel so bad writing this review i absolutely hate giving a 1 star review to debut authors but wow i'm just blown this even saw the light of day 
 and what's a twi-fan-fic without insta-love this book has plenty of that and co-dependency keep in mind they have been dating for 2 weeks let me count the ways: 
 ""i feel like i could take on the world when i'm with you"" 
 i felt a new confidence building i could take on the world with him by my side 
 this felt so real it seemed like my future was suddenly very clear i had a whole new purpose--and it all revolved around this boy by my side 
 everything else paled in significance i could not live without him as much as it upset me to hurt the others it was nothing compared to the stabbing pain i felt when i thought of being parted from him 
 and the more time that went by the more i realized i could not live without adam 
 wtf i'm so tired of co-dependent relationships is it a wonder why young girls think they need a boyfriend to survive are these the ideals we want our youth to grow up learning i don't take issue with megan being in love but reading the statements above disturbs me the entire book revolves around how in love she is with adam so don't expect much of a plot in this book the major conflict in the story comes out of nowhere and ends before it even begins just as it did in twilight 
 and omg the mythology it will make your head spin we learn most of the world through god awful info-dumps i read those pages over a few times and i still don't understand perhaps if the author showed the reader instead of telling us maybe i would have been able to keep up the only thing i think i understood was that megan is carrier of a specific gene that would enable her to produce children to bear the mark since carrier's are rare the order (a society that ""looks after"" the marked) specially selects the carrier's mates i suppose being gay is out if you are a carrier because you have a duty to produce babies anyway apparently it is forbidden for adam and megan to be together because if they have a child it could destroy the world yeahi don't get it either once finding that out megan decides she doesn't want to be a marked one anymore and help save the world she wants to be with her romeo 'cause being in love is more important than the safety of the world donchaknow and please don't get me started on the whole 25-year-old pregnancy i can't even 
 fallon you had all this potential the setting was perfect: ireland and you wasted your descriptions on megan eating her wheaties and putting on her red converses *points to face* this is me not giving two shits 
 cait babe you were right 
 i'll leave you with a definition from webster:

 ok i'm done 
 /end rant \(-_-)/ 
 more reviews and more at cuddlebuggery book blog probably my favorite book of 2015 didn't want it to end so i made it last as long as possible reader logic: 
 i hate this book 
 i hate it so much i had to get a new hardback copy to read so i could underline all the parts i hate about it so much and post them on goodreads 
 i hate it with such a passion i also bought copies for all my friends and family also in new hardback editions so they could hate it along with me 
 when the tv series came on i was so fuming with rage i watched the entire season twice and bought six copies of the dvd because i could not believe how much i could hate something 
 i had spent so much time discussing how much i hate this with all my friends who hate it too and who all bought copies i decided to get a george rr martin tattoo on my buttock to show how strong my hatred for his work is 
 there was such a collectivity at the time--like everyone uniting in hating this together--that some of us formed relationships in hate i met my wife at a george rr martin convention and we got married as one of the characters reciting parts of the book for our vows and paid grrm all our life savings to come read from his horrible book 
 we hate this beyond belief maybe one day we'll read a book we like and the author can get rich on love i can't remember the last time a book made my heart feel this empty and this full at the same time man what a magnificent installment the story here is so epic and sprawling and the way it's told--especially the pacing how the different story threads were woven together--it was just perfect not to mention that i love these characters so much it makes my heart ache waiting for the next book is already causing me pain and we've still got two whole years to go gah i am still #teammaven scroll down to the spoiler portion of my review to read my theory on his redemption arc i'm either right or dead wrong but my gut is telling me to there is more to maven than meets the eye 
 ""mare i am very afraid for you things have been done to you things no person should suffer you've seen horrible things done horrible things and they will change you i'm so afraid for what you could be if given the wrong chance"" 
 enter the world of shades of gray no character will be spared 
 i finished and i have many many thoughts let me try to get them down coherently in gif's (find my review of red queen here): 
 1 first 50% i was mostly bored >>not that the writing wasn't amazing because it was or because there wasn't action because there was but because there was little romance and no maven and no palace and i just wasn't as entertained as the first book but that all changed the second half when things got good 
 2 a certain someone's death hit me harder than expected 
 >> i didn't like this person at all in the first book and now i'm thinking i should read one of the novellas to get more of this character 
 3 i really loved mare in this book 
 >>i'm sure some reviews will say she was moping and angry but honestly she was real mare struggled to make the right decisions and be who they wanted her to be and she was haunted by the events of book one (again this series reminds me a lot of mockingjay-katniss feels but for me that's a wonderful thing because i loved hunger games and would gladly read scenes like that over and over i got why it was so hard of her to let go of protecting killorn and move into some sort of friendship with cal i liked that she didn't know how to interact with the children and people kept looking at her like she was a traitor to both red and silver i liked the way she kept the notes from maven and the way she and cal still mourned the boy they thought they had known 
 4 the ending oh dear lawd that ending now that was an ending 
 his expression is unreadable but his meaning is clear with one hand he points at his feet his fingers whiter than i remember 
 i do as he says 
 i kneel 
 >> read below to understand my thoughts (everything is marked as a spoiler fyi): 
 that ending with maven i sensed it coming but it was just as epic as i hoped i felt less chemistry between mare and cal in this book (even though i'm #teammaven i still loved cal in the first) and while i could be dead wrong here is what i think: 
 victoria is setting us up for a warner-esque (of tahereh mafi's shatter me) love story between mare and maven i know it makes no sense -he committed countless unexcusable crimes (a la darkling and warner)- but do we know for sure that was him do we really did we see him actually hurt anyone in this book no okay well technically he did hurt mare with that branding thing but gah i just feel like there is some sort of explanation maybe somehow it protects her i dunno i just know there is more to the story and all of the bad things that did happen cersei -excuse me elara was still alive and well and do we know why she was in the prison do we really understand what was happening during that prison break out why was her hair graying and her appearance worn i tell you why: because there is more to this whole ""maven is evil"" business than meets the eye i am getting very strong juliette (of shatter me) vibes where mare is going to start to understand or find out more about maven in the next book and help him struggle to redeem himself by the end of the series i am wishing for a hea between m&m but most likely i think she will help save him from himself and end up with cal or alone maven is not pure evil and i don't think he is the villain the way we think he is i think there are other factors at play that will be revealed -like how we thought warner was pure evil in shatter me only to find his actions explained away in the sequels 
 ""no one is born a monster"" but i wish some people were it would make it easier to hate them to kill them to forget their dead faces ""even maven"" i'm sorry but quotes like that hint at my suspicions so well shades of gray people shades of gray 
 >>now maybe you can think this is just wishful thinking your reaction to my prediction is probably this: 
 and you can throw a hundred things maven did in my face and tell me i can't explain all of that away 
 there are people who read shatter me who refused to forgive warner i realize rooting for maven is crazy to a rational eye but in books i tend to love and sympathize with the villain and i'm sorry but reading that ending where mare has given herself over to maven in exchange for everyone's freedom i just know there is so much potential there 
 maybe i'm wrong and he really is a psychopath but i got chills with that ending and it was because of what we might see in the next book i'm sorry but i'm just not getting an epic love story for cal & mare i think she is going to fall for maven & try to save him from himself in the next two books i could be dead wrong and i realize i sound crazy but i'm telling you i think there is more to maven than the villain victoria has been leading us to believe she's a master at twists and i am telling you that i think maven is her trump card i think maven is end game for this series and i do not think he is pure evil even though we've only been offered evidence of the contrary i'm calling it and if i'm wrong well maybe i am but my author instincts are telling me there is more than black and white evil and good this series is going to be about shades of gray 
 final notes: why oh why did i have to wait a whole book to get two scenes with maven i know why because victoria is an evil genius and knows she is torturing us but it's exactly what we need to get amped up for the third book (there's four planned now right) glass sword did have second-book syndrome -it was building to future events and showing us character development and it was absolutely getting us to see how this world truly functioned but it was truly necessary for the stage victoria is planning to set we all saw what she was capable in red queen and i have faith the next two books will be a non-stop rollercoaster of madness now that she has given us all the building blocks and endeared us to all of the characters (i see what you did there) so that she can let blood fly in the next did i love this book more than red queen no but i think victoria did an excellent job preparing us for what's to come and building the world none of us really got to see in the first book this book was fantastic a thrilling survival story with a hearty dose of humor the main character mark was such a smartass and i loved it the voice and the premise hooked me in right away and kept me thoroughly engaged the whole time my only real issues were that some of the minor characters didn't really stand out as much as they could've and some of the science heavy bits were a little hard to follow and felt info-dumpy at times but the human aspect--the heart of the story--was totally on point and for the most part i just had a great time reading this 
 overall this book was exciting and fun and oh man am i excited for the movie i would definitely recommend this to anyone who likes survival stories or funny thrillers or sci-fi with an emphasis on the sci wow just wow sarah has done it again this book was amazing the romance was borderline new adult which i loved but it was also greatly paced the plot was so well thought out and executed as well i highly recommend a court of thorns and roses eta: i just did my final final read-through of this book and i have to say it was a messy road and a long revision but i am really freaking proud of the result 
 eta: it has a cover 
 sin city plus romeo and juliet minus romance plus monsters 
 this is the strangest book i've ever written i love it 
 it's the story of two teens in a broken world where violent acts breed actual monsters some are shadows with teeth that feed on flesh and bone some are corpses that feed on blood and some can pass for human those feed on souls 
 it's the story of kate harker the only daughter of a crime boss and august flynn the son of a man trying to hold his city together she's a human who wants to be a monster and he's a monster who wishes he were human 
 it's dark and violent and existential and the whole thing was inspired by a line from vicious: 
 ""plenty of humans were monstrous and plenty of monsters knew how to play at being human"" 
 8315: edited to add: and the official title isthis savage song why song 
 remember when i said that august was a monster he's not just any kind of monster but one of only three soul-eaters in the city and these rare creatures (he wouldn't like that word) use music to bring the souls of their prey to surface 
 but it's more than that this book isn't a solo it's a duet a song played by two very different teens trying to survive a very broken world there are moments of discord and a few of harmony and through it all they have to keep the melody alive bwahahaha ahh so good rick does it again suffice to say apollo you are awesome this book made me literally ""lol"" multiple times and brought a smile to my face seeing old characters i love again yay 
 ill be uploading my review to my youtube channel this week wow that was a great ending to this very fantastical series i cannot wait to go into more detail in my series review which will be out probably next week i'll be covering my opinions on all 5 books and then my overall opinion of the series i am so happy i finally read pjo this was a ""dam"" good series (lol get it ""dam"") ok finally i can talk about this book 
 before i get into it i want to say i learned a big lesson when it comes to sponsored reviews i was approached to do a sponsored review of this book and at the time my only thoughts were ""hell yeah"" 
 i was planning on reading the book anyways so why not be paid the contract i had to sign seemed pretty simple don't spoil things in the book and don't give the book to anyone then i read the book i contacted harper letting them know that my review would not be favorable and i would be raising concerns i had over what i viewed as racist stereotypes then i heard nothing backfor weeks until about 3 weeks later i got an email saying my sponsorship had been dissolved and that per my contract i could not talk about the book until it's release which is now so you better believe i have thoughts 
 *i want to make a note here because some people are confused this was not standard practice for a sponsored review i have never seen or heard of a publisher dissolving a partnership with a booktuber because they didn't like the review which is why i am still very shocked this happened* 
 but now instead of telling you why this book is racist as there are better voices i will direct you to justina ireland who has spoken out about this book - 
 http://justinairelandcom/dammit-this 
 what i want to address is the ableism recently veronica roth did an interview with npr where they discussed how the current gifts in ctm were inspired by chronic pain the interviewer says that chronic pain can be a gift to which roth agrees and goes on to say that part of the book is cyra figuring out why her and others are worthy of pain 
 http://wwwnprorg/templates/transcri 
 * note that roth has said she herself has chronic pain* 
 this to me was so upsetting i have lived with chronic pain now for 7 years it is something that has taken over my life and caused a lot of harm some days it is so bad i can barely sit up let alone get out of bed and to see someone equate it with a gift or say people are worthy of it makes me feel sick whether or not roth has chronic pain herself i am not one to say she is lying that does not take away the harm it is not a magical shield to be pulled out when you've hurt people 
 twitter threads re: chronic pain 
 https://twittercom/heatherezell/stat 
 https://twittercom/sharpegirl/status 
 at this point i don't even care to do a real review of this book i want to put it behind me and never touch on it again i think the most interesting thing that will come of this series might be a new word a word readers will forever use to describe a series that while compelling and wonderful at it's inception faltered under the weight of an irrational author you can say: the author harrised the series (or ""the book was harrised"" would be acceptable too) 
 it is with great sadness i have to report history did prove the predictor of fate and the three preceding books delineated into the final wet slap on the pavement another of harris' literary turds was birthed but ts eliot was not right the sookie stackhouse universe did not end with a whimper: it was an apathetic shrug 
 there are spoilers ahead many many spoilers 
 i know there are forensic psychologists and forensic accountants and forensic anthropologists and -- well -- it goes on and on are there forensic editors or would it be a forensic novelist maybe we need just a plain 'ol detective because i don't know how you go from writing a great paranormal romance beloved by millions to this piece of crap novel there has to be some covert publishing house hbo royalties amazon agreement kind of reason to make any logical sense of this book 
 i just can't understand why she ended it the way she did this is pulp fiction not marquez not franzen hell it's not even george r r martin am i crazy there is a social contract between the readers/buyers of romance novels and the novelists who write them it's this: the girl ends up with the guy about whom and for which legions of fans have been pining it's the reason we pick up romance novels in the first place we want to read about a coupling so intense it speaks to a deep place inside of us an atavistic need to be consumed by lust passion and love that is the social contract so why at the end of this pulp romance series did i feel like i was reading the white hotel it was awkward (and creepy just to warn you there is a sex scene it's bad like - we should report it to the school's psychologist - bad) 
 i mean i see how ms harris painted herself into a corner with sookie and eric but that's the beauty of fiction especially pulp fiction -- you can paint yourself right out there's no shame in it because -- we already know it's crap fiction but it's fun crap fiction so it's okay there's no judgement here watch me do it 
 ""oh hey sookie it's me niall i'm back i heard that you used that magic fairy thing i gave you in a selfless act so guess what here's another because you're so cute and blonde now you can wish that all vampires revert back to their human state"" (which by the way would have been the kindest thing for which any person could have wished) ""oh really great grand daddy thanks now eric's not shooting blanks and we can make many many babies together and we can watch a bunch of thousand year old people try to revert back into their humanity which would have been way more interesting than reading about me and sam going fucking line dancing"" 
 as for a review: here goes it's another bad story very thin plot with so many holes there is a whole villain in this novel that goes totally unrevealed literally harris forgets about him (remember the devil - that wasn't claude right) um there are a lot of casseroles - again poor fashion choices a lot of goodbyes i guess harris is using this book to say a final goodbye to all of these characters so for that reason there are a lot of scenes that do nothing to advance the thread of a story there is some other stuff butitwastoo boring to remember 
 if you want my advice on whether or not to read it i say do i mean if you read the first 12 you should finish what you started and finish the series a least you can accomplish something that the author couldn'tbut borrow the book so good 
 so freaking good 
 not just good but great 
 gahhhhhhhhh 
 perfection 
 i read queen of shadows back in june but could not say anything about it (not even that i had it) but now i can and let me tell you sarah has done it again i loved qos so beautiful bloody and outstanding oh androwanswoon 
 5/5 stars of course i got a chance to read an early version of this a little while ago needless to say i jumped at it 
 the reason for this is that so far i haven't read a book by brandon sanderson that i haven't loved that means it's quite likely that i'll get a chance to read another good book which is always welcome 
 or i'll finally read something of sanderson's i *don't* like which would thrill me honestly 
 why well because brandon writes so much faster than me it only seems fair that some of his stuff should be crap it just doesn't seem fair that he's brilliant and fast 
 unfortunately for my ego steelheart is another win for sanderson proving that he's not a brilliant writer of epic fantasy he's simply a brilliant writer period 
 simply said great book tight writing nice take on superheroes nice world creation absolutely worth your time no stars 
 disclaimer: i read to about 65% skim read to about 90% and read to the end also this review will contain spoilers for the alternate ending that are not in spoiler tags 
 years ago when twilight was in its prime someone told me that breaking dawn was never supposed to happen that it was the book where stephenie meyer was given free reign to do whatever she wanted because the series was so popular everyone would buy it regardless of quality and rake in big dough-cheese for her and her publishers i don't really know how true that assumption is but dammit if isn't true for life and death 
 take me for example: i own all of the twilight books have read twilight (just the first book) a total of 4 times 5 if you include this (and i do) written about some of the good that came of the series (i'm not always a fire-breathing bitch queen) made fun of it enjoyed parts of it loathed chucks of it and everything else in between i also attempted to re-read the series back in 2012 for this little thing i started called project: hindsight and had so much fun reviewing midnight sun (i really wish she'd finish that) but by the time i got to new moon (the book i dislike the most) i just couldn't continue on and abandoned the project 
 over the past few years i've settled on generally disliking everything twilight stands for while holding onto a morbid fascination and begrudgingly bestowing some sort of respect for a series that put ya literature on the map 
 so when i heard of life and death literally the day it released i knew i'd buy it no questions asked i was hoping many of the issues i had with twilight would be corrected with this version it had so much potential to be great i never expected there to be huge drastic changes to the story -- i did expect it to be pretty much the same as twilight so believe me when i say that was the least of its problems 
 i won't bother reviewing this book because it's essentially the same as twilight and i've already written a review for that just swap around the pronouns in your head as you read it 
 in the forward stephenie meyer opens with this: 
 ""but i've always maintained that it would have made no difference if the human were male and the vampire female-- it's still the same story gender and species aside twilight has always been a story about the magic and obsession and frenzy of first love"" 
 i don't think she was very successful there were times when i wondered what meyer was truly trying to accomplish here was she trying to basically say her novel features an unhealthy relationship even with roles reversed as in ""hey guys my book is horrible either way"" or was her goal to further highlight how twilight had a lot of instances of sexism including sexual violence against women because if so then i suppose yeah she was successful 
 here's a general run down: beau is your classic gary stu who falls for the ultimate manic pixie dream girl edythe he has no aspirations to do or be anything until he spots the love of his life in his high school cafeteria not much has changed with our young desperate lovers except for their pronouns but edythe is still a jerk/control freak/stalker and somehow less creepy than edward and beau is still a very weak character and as interesting as the dirt beneath my shoe there is an alternate ending which is essentially a pathetic attempt to pack new moon and eclipse into a clusterfuck of info-dumping but more on that later 
 what i really want to talk about is the treatment of the female characters 
 i don't know how this was even possible but reading life and death actually made me hate twilight even more than i originally did this is mostly because it became shockingly evident that certain scenes (sexual assault) were purposefully left out in this version because the characters didn't have vaginas lovely 
 bella's attempted rape scene has now turned into beau's assault scene if you remember in twilight while bella is getting lost in port angeles she runs into a group of drunk men who attempt to sexually assault her this is made clear by their jeers (""don't be like that sugar"") and edward's later dialogue but for beau his assailants are a mix between female and male and have the intention of beating him up because they think he is a cop the section is entirely re-written with more dialogue a gun and threats of death 
 then there is rosalie's rape scene now changed to royal's assault scene instead of royal being raped he's tricked during the wedding and beat up within an inch of his life now one could argue the time period and say ""well that's happened back then it's just how things were"" and maybe before i read life and death i could have seen that point but when the two biggest instances of female sexual assault are completely left out when you swap the genders oy that's an issue 
 now that is not to say i wanted to see men get rape in life and death it's just a glaring problem where i now see those scenes as ""literary rape"" used as plot devices to add depth and sympathy to rosalie's character and to give edward a reason to look super heroic in the face of rapists maggie stiefvater said it best in this is a post about literary rape: 
 ""i'm talking about novels where the rape scene could just as easily be any other sort of violent scene and it only becomes about sex because there's a woman involved if the genders were swapped a rape scene wouldn't have happened the author would've come up with a different sort of scenario/ backstory/ defining moment for a male character"" 
 that is exactly what happened here 
 one could argue that meyer wrote a more progressive version of twilight with life and death and that's partly true to an extent edythe does appear to try to make her relationship with beau as equal as possible but there are constant references to the gender changes as if meyer is trying to prove something to the reader and they only seemed to further resign me to the fact that meyer has no idea what she's doing (bold is mine) 
 his straight gold hair was wound into a bun on the back of his head but there was nothing feminine about it-- somehow it made him look even more like a man 
 i fumbled for my wallet 
 ""um let me-- you didn't even get anything--"" 
 ""my treat beau"" ""but--"" 
 ""try not to get caught up in antiquated gender roles"" 
 she turned toward the cafeteria swinging her bag into place 
 ""hey let me get that for you"" i offered 
 she looked up at me with doe eyes ""does it look too heavy for me"" 
 ""well i mean"" 
 ""sure"" she said she slid the bag down her arm and then held it out to me very deliberately using just the tip of her pinkie finger 
 it was like meyer was shouting me ""do i impress you"" and i kept going: 
 in the hands of a more skilled writer this might have been pulled off flawlessly i found the changes she made with beau's narration interesting meyer mentioned in the forward that bella is more flowery with her words where beau is not this is a complete understatement the one thing twilight actually had going for it was the occasionally pretty quote i say occasional because the novel contains too many short simple sentences than i usually like in my books in life and death's case the writing has been watered down so much that it feels on par with see spot run and i don't necessarily think this is a gender thing just because a character is a boy doesn't mean he can't be articulate or well-versed 
 ""bonnie there's something you didn't know about me i used to smell really good to vampires"" 
 corny so very corny 
 it's not uncommon to discover popular ya authors' inability to write convincing male povs *cough*veronica roth*cough* and i learned from midnight sun that it's not exactly meyer's forte either but c'mon this was really bad even for her 
 the there's beau's obsession with edythe's unhealthy* body oh god i'm so disgusted with this part and i don't really understand why it was included 
 ""her pale arms her slim shoulders the fragile-looking twigs of her collarbones the vulnerable hollows above them the swanlike column of her neck the gentle swell of her breasts-- don't stare don't stare-- and the ribs i could nearly count under the thin cotton she was too perfect i realized with a crushing wave of despair there was no way this goddess could ever belong with me"" 
 is this supposed to show beau's unrealistic expectations of women's bodies that only vampires can achieve this level of ""perfection"" that society constantly forces on us because there is no other explanation that works well here and i'm really trying to give meyer the benefit of the doubt and throw her a bone the issue with this theory is there's no indication in the book that this is an unrealistic view actually quite the opposite happens later in that same scene: 
 i had a new definition of beauty 
 sigh i don't think i need to go into why this is problematic so i'll just leave that there for your critique 
 *unhealthy as in for majority of women this is an unattainable beauty standard apologies if that came off as body shaming women/girls where that is their healthy i'm speaking specifically about society's constant pressure on women and girls to be as thin as possible many times to the detriment of their physical and emotional health when beau describes edythe he focuses so heavily on the sharp angles of her bones and it perpetuates the idea that these characteristics make her more beautiful than others i find these descriptions irresponsible and feel there could have been a better way to describe her 
 so let's talk about the ending this part will have spoilers beyond this point this is your one and only warning 
 yes it's re-written -- horribly if i'm being honest during the scene with the ballet studio (which btw beau didn't take ballet as a kid because he's a boy *eyeroll*) everything is pretty much similar expect for the fact that edythe can't suck out all the venom out of beau's body leaving him only one possible future: becoming a vampire super early and living happily ever after with his bae edythe 
 i wouldn't have had an issue with the change if it had actually been written without the massive amounts of info-dumping it reads like meyer decided last minute that she wanted to only do 2 chapters of the gender swap (which she mentions in the forward) realized she spent all of her deadline time on re-writing the entire book and quickly wrote an ending hours before she emailed it to her editor 
 she crams the werewolf history volturi history rules of being a vampire and beau's human funeral altogether and it's just so goddamn messy it also makes the insta-love look even worse because at least bella had 3 other books and a pining jacob to consider leaving edward it was just an overall hot ass mess that seemed so out of place this is why i said they just let meyer do whatever the hell she wants; half that stuff would have never flown with a debut novel or any novel that desired to actually be you know good 
 would i recommend this and should you read it hard to say my first response is ""oh god no don't waste your money"" $1299 is an unacceptable price for an ebook (thank goodness for kindle returns) it doesn't really offer anything vital to the twilight fandom/universe and is generally a horrible piece of writing that i want to fling stones at but then the other half of me enjoys the suffering of my fellow book lovers and is considering purchasing this as a gag joke to both of my lovely co-bloggers because that's really all this trite wish-fulfilling wankfest of a re-imaginging is good for and i really really need to stop being so damn curious about everything but anyway i'm rambling when all i really want to say is the ball's in your court now el james i eagerly await your newest fan fiction original book do you remember that taylor swift song about romeo and juliet love story 
 it's lyrics go something like this: 
 i'm a pretty little girl who knows nothing about literature 
 so i sing a song about starcrossed lovers 
 whose only problem is that daddy doesn't approve 
 but it's all good because we get married anyway 
 just like that cliffnote's story about romeo and juliet 
 yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeyyyyy 
 we have a tendency with ya literature today to have stories with the super duper happiest of happy endings where everything works out and true love's only real complications are external difficulties and self-esteem issues for the girl 
 i'm trying to think of the perfect example here and because this review is full of cheap shots at easy targets i'm going to go with 
 twilight 
 come on down bella and edward 
 now don't get me wrong there's nothing wrong with happy endings and butterflies and rainbows and kittens they're lovely lovely things and in the hands of an accomplished author they do well there's also nothing wrong with having a relationship that's troubled by only external forces once again in the right hands it's fine i'm not being a miserly old grinch here okay maybe a little bit but moving on 
 the problem is that in real life relationships are usually impacted by internal factors so when you base your story on perfection that can only be tainted by evil people trying to destroy your true love and twist the story to finally reach that happily ever after then what you sacrifice is often the very real almost-tangible relatable emotions that a more realistic thoughtful storyline could bring 
 and also romeo and juliet is a tragedy taylor swift 
 thank you kieran culkan you're a fresh breeze amongst the stagnant world of apathetic performers 
 now what i love about laini taylor other than everything is that this woman is made of fairytales i swear she's like woven together by sweet kisses and dewdrops she's been sung into being by blind minstrels bathed in moonlight she's wrapped in gossamer and shrived in pure white swan feathers you know all that magical shit she's that the woman is magic and she writes magic if anyone could take romeo and juliet mate it with a ya paranormal romance and produce a love child that people don't want to drown at birth - then it would be laini taylor 
 this book is powerful emotive heart breaking anguishing 
 what i'm sayingthe point i'm trying to make herethe truth is laini taylor kicked my heart in the ass 
 and i liked it 
 this review can also be found on my blog cuddlebuggery book blog love the writing love the world love these characters the ending hurt my soul but fortunately i have book 3 to jump into immediately so allie is an orphaned teenager in a dystopian fantasy where people are enslaved by vampire masters then she gets turned into a vampire and struggles with the morality of being a monster 
 so at first i was like 
 but then she was like 
 a comparable representation on the scale of awesomeness - not a literal depiction 
 and then i was like 
 right away from the beginning of the novel allie was pretty ass kicking 
 and then kanin the vampire showed up and i was like 
 yeah sure whatevs 
 but then he was like 
 and then i was like 
 so then allie goes trekking through the woods and i'm like 
 and then she meets up zeke and i was like 
 then zeke is like ewwww vampires suck and i was like 
 then stuff with them happened and i was like 
 so then i was worried about the writing since i'd been on the fence about the iron fey but then kagawa did a lot of: 
 and i was like 
 and then stephanie said the plot was slow and i was like 
 and then i got to the end and allie was like 
 so i was like 
 this review also appears on our blog cuddlebuggery i feel empowered by that book especially the fight scenes so ba 45 solid i've read this book many different times in many different ways 
 i read it off the page when it first came out later i listened to gaiman's narration of the audiobook when i was sequestered in the north woods of wisconsin in a desperate attempt to finish book two i watched the movie and enjoyed it 
 my most recent experience of the book was listening to it with my little boy on a long car ride i wasn't sure he'd be able to get into it not because of the vocabulary he's very sharp for being 45 he's good with words but sometimes he gets a little scared 
 despite my worries he seemed to enjoy it he paid attention attention asking for us to turn it back on after we stopped by the side of the road a day later he excitedly told me all about the story apparently forgetting i'd been in the car too 
 all of that was months ago fast forward to now 
 * * * 
 ""dad"" oot said ""do you know the guy who wrote coraline"" 
 the question caught me by surprise the two of us were driving to a party together a friend was having a bonfire and i was amazed that he was thinking about anything other than smores 
 ""i do"" i said ""his name is neil gaiman"" 
 ""do you have his phone number"" he asked 
 ""no"" i said 
 ""do you know where he lives"" 
 ""i do"" i said 
 ""are you his friend"" 
 that brought me up short for oot that's a simple question if you meet someone and play with them they're you're friend easy 
 for adults these things are harder and it's doubly hard for me these days my life has changed so much over the last five years and my previously established metric for friendship doesn't work very well any more 
 you see for the majority of my life a friend was someone who would say help me move a couch someone you could bum 10 dollars off of if you needed to a friend was someone who felt comfortable enough to come over to my house without calling first then if i wasn't home they would let themselves in eat out of my fridge and start watching tv 
 while i'm terribly fond of him neil gaiman has never done any of these things 
 then again neither have any of the other authors i've met over the last few years i'm painfully aware of the need for new friendship metrics but i haven't managed to develop a good set yet 
 that won't make any sense to my boy but still i try to be honest with him whenever i can ""i don't know if we're friends"" i say ""but we're colleagues"" 
 ""what's a colleagues"" he asks right on cue 
 ""that means we know each other and do the same job"" i explain 
 ""oh yes"" he says ""you're both authors"" 
 it makes me proud when he says that i'm proud that my boy knows i write books 
 ""do you know his address"" oot asks and it takes me a while to realize that he's returning to his previous line of questioning 
 ""i do"" i said not bothering to point out that knowing where someone lives and knowing their address is pretty much the same thing 
 ""can you send him a letter"" 
 ""i could"" i say 
 oot pauses for a moment then and i realize that this has been the point of the whole conversation he wants to send neil gaiman a message 
 ""what would you like me to write to him"" i ask 
 ""you should tell him he *sure* knows how to write a scary story"" 
 * * * 
 so there you go you don't really need me to tell you how i feel about one of gaiman's books at this point you know i love his writing 
 instead i'm offering up my boy's unvarnished opinion did he think the story was scary absolutely but he still wanted us to turn it back on as soon as we were back in the car 
 what's more he was still thinking about coraline months later and it was the first book where he's ever shown any interest in contacting the author 
 so bravo neil gaiman you've managed to win over two generations of the rothfuss household what does [that lady] see when she looks in the mirror kelsea wondered how could a woman who looked so old still place so much importance on being attractive kelsea saw now that there was something far worse than being ugly: being ugly and thinking you were beautiful 
 because how dare anyone ugly have confidence in themselves 
 when i die i want inscribed on my gravestone ""she read the queen of the tearling"" call me unambitious but that shall be counted among my proudest accomplishments because never have i ever read a more painfully long worthless book 
 the copywriter who wrote this book's summary compares it to the hunger games and game of thrones; they have clearly read neither they compared to the world-building to that of the hunger games they compared the characters to that of game of thrones 
 are you fucking kidding me 
 a thousand monkeys typing on a thousand typewriters could write a book that is more similar to those works than anything this book has to offer 
 this was also the most intensely painful reading experience i have ever had due to the sheer length of the book aggravated by the fact that the book just dragged on and on and on without a point this is the book that doesn't end a good 30% of the book is devoted to traveling not since the hobbit have i been so fucking bored out of my mind bilbo baggins could have gone there and back again and then make another round around middle earth and sure why not---take a few years to flutter around rivendell chilling with the elves in the time it took this book to go anywhere 
 the summary: kelsea raleigh is the new queen of the tearling her mother the late queen elyssa has died and it is time for kelsea to claim the throne she travels to the new kingdom she's traveling she's on a horse they're slowly making their way to the castle slooooooooowly 
 meanwhile the red queen of mortmesne is wonder where the fuck kelsea is she's spent the last 19 years searching for her seriously where the fuck is the girl oh well the red queen will think about that later time to fuck some slaves oh yeah give it to me baby 
 kelsea's still traveling man her new guards are really really good looking oh shit she's kidnapped but not really because the kidnappers pretty much let kelsea wander free 
 oh whew she's free back to traveling whooo oh yay we're at the castle kelsea makes some fucking stupid decisions and pretty much dooms her country within hours of reaching her new castle 
 meanwhile javel the guard is telling his story his sad story of how his wife was lost to him 
 kelsea's throned queen yay she spends a lot of time talking to her advisors she almost gets killed (several times) 
 meanwhile the priest father tyler is really really upset at how his life gets flipped turned upside down 
 the red queen of montmesne is fucking more slaves where is that dratted kelsea 
 kelsea thinks she is very plain she should go on a diet but no she shouldn't because she's plain anyway and who cares about appearances anyway man kelsea wishes she were pretty as pretty as her maidservant the one whose beauty is so valued that she got enslaved and raped for it 
 meanwhile javel is still doing shit talking to people getting roped into some random-ass plans 
 father tyler is still moping around 
 the red queen's pissed off that fucking kelsea why does she keep eluding my grasp and by grasp the red queen means her minion's grasps since the red queen is just too important to do anything about hunting kelsea herself magic pfft ugh whatever let's get ourselves a 7-year old little boy and bleep him in the bleep bleep that is so not legal 
 javel's still talking somehow 
 kelsea's still talking to people it sure would be nice if she were pretty but really kelsea doesn't have time to think about that right now there are more important things at hand like insulting a woman in front of the royal court 
 fuck they're traveling again 
 the end 
 765 mother fucking pages 
 the setting: it doesn't make any motherfucking sense i started this book thinking it was a medieval fantasy it wasn't it has an old-world feel it's not women are in long dresses we are riding horses we're using hawks to hunt there are kings and queens and magic and castles what you you mean it's not in the past what do you mean it's not a fantasy 
 this is the future this is a dystopia we used to be the united states and europe what the actual fuck what happened 
 i seriously do not fucking understand this setting first off it is fucking lazy because the retelling of the history is told by mouth as a story 
 ""once upon a time there was a kingdom called the tearling it was founded by a man named william tear a utopian who dreamed of a land of plenty for all but ironically the tearling was a kingdom of scarce resources for the british and americans had not been fortunate in their choice of landing place"" 
 british american this is the motherfucking future people how the fuck did we get here and more importantly where are we 
 why are all technologies lost we supposedly got to this place in an event called the crossing where is this place are we even on earth why are there so few survivors this land is called new europe we have a town called new london did it actually pop up out of the ocean why was the old world destroyed why did we have to seek refuge in new europe are we so fucking inconsistent that in all the hundreds of fucking years in which we've settled here that we have lost all the motherfucking techologies of today's time in the future so much that we don't even have the technology for motherfucking printing presses we have geneticists but we don't have the technology to buy books 
 and why are books rare because we motherfucking burned them for fuel when we got here despite the motherfucking forests of oaks that surrounds this new land they fucking burned books for fuel 
 that was what had happened to most of the books that originally came over in the british-american crossing: the desperate had burned them for fuel or warmth 
 there are no doctors there are like 2 doctors in the whole of fucking new london new civilizations have come up with technology they've been so much more innovative than this the medieval ages were more advanced than the tearling because they don't know how to fucking make gunpowder or cannons 
 seriously you expect us to retain absolutely fucking nothing of the knowledge that we have gained for all these years did you choose the motherfucking dumbest pieces of shits to carry over to the new world why didn't you choose important people like scientists botanists doctors instead of a bunch of fucking feeblewitted morons who don't know how to carry over fucking technology from the old world when you crossed over to the new who fucking burn books for fuel despite being surrounded by trees 
 fucking dystopian fail 
 the writing: not since charles dickens have i read such verbosity there is a reason why this book is so long it is packed to the brim with the most long-winded irrelevant description of every fucking thing in the world 
 introspection sure this book has it aplenty let's describe every single fucking thought that kelsea has ever fucking had in her head kelsea thinks a lot some relevant things mostly very very very idiotic things that make no fucking different whether they were omitted or not 
 red hair was a recessive gene and in the three centuries since the crossing it had bred slowly and steadily out of the population carlin had told kelsea that some women and even some men liked to dye their hair red since the rare commodity was always valuable but after about an hour of sneaking looks at the guard kelsea became certain that she was looking at a true head of red hair no dye was that good 
 her dreams kelsea thinks about them her opinions about the men sure let's have it kelsea's insecurity sure let's have several fucking paragraphs on it man her food just tastes fucking terrible tonight let's describe her thoughts on the venison in excruciating detail 
 dinner was venison stringy and only barely edible after roasting over the fire the deer must have been very old kelsea had seen only a few birds and squirrels on their ride through the reddick though the greenery was very lush; there could be no lack of water kelsea wanted to ask the men about the lack of animals but she worried that it would be taken as a complaint about the meal 
 man it's a motherfucking long journey after all the traveling alone takes about 30% of the book let's just describe every single freaking detail on it the houses are built with bricks let's describe the fucking bricks in detail 
 to the east kelsea spotted what must be the house of a noble: a high tower made of red brick real brick tearling brick was a notoriously poor building material compared to mortmesne's which was made with better mortar and commanded at least a pound per kilo carlin had an oven made of real bricks built for her by barty and kelsea had wondered more than once whether barty had bought the bricks off the black market from mortmesne 
 details details details we are fucking drowning in details the clothes of the noblemen let's decribe them one of the ladies wear a hat in the shape of a fish let's mention that and while we're at it let's make fun of her for it will it ever stop 
 the guards: not since monty python and the holy grail have there ever been such irreverent incompetent fucking royal guards they are the most fucking pathetic examples of soldiers i have ever fucking encountered this is kelsea she is one of the last of her royal line her life is priceless she is supposed to be guarded by 9 men 9 men who are motherfucking blundering assholes because they cannot do anything right 
 while they are traveling the men get drunk and sing bawdy songs instead of securing her guard they are completely fucking shocked that later on in the journey they are captured 
 while they are traveling they are caught again off their guard kelsea is forced to flee for her life 
 at the castle while they are supposed to be watching her back kelsea gets stabbed---in the back 
 a bolt of pain arrowed all the way down to her toes 
 stabbed she thought dazed mace didn't cover my back after all 
 later on in the bath kelsea gets cornered by an assassin she's almost fucking killed again 
 where are the fucking nitwits guarding her 
 guards guards they are supposed to be subservient they are supposed to be respectful they are supposed to be odebient they are not supposed to talk back to her oh sure they say they're not going to talk back to her 
 he stared at her without expression ""i say nothing lady that's why i'm a queen's guard"" 
 but words mean fucking nothing because whatever mace (real name lazarus head of kelsea's guard) is it's not fucking subservient he talks down to her as if she were an incompetent little girl (well she is but she is still the fucking queen) he talks back to her he disagrees with her when she's gravely injured mace nudges her by poking at her with his foot is this the behavior of a guard towards his queen i don't think so 
 mace's boot landed in the small of her back and kelsea bit her tongue against a scream 
 kelsea: incompetent nitwit a heroine who is so astoundingly stupid and unprepared by her fucking mentors that she is unworthy of governing anything but a toy kingdom made of legos 
 i hope kelsea steps on the pieces i hope they hurt badly i hope our aspiring queen is in pain for the torment and the headache and the hangover i experienced while reading this book about one of the most insipid heroine to ever litter the precious pages of a book 
 she constantly complains about how plain she is 
 but her face was as round and ruddy as a tomato and--there was no other word for it--plain 
 she has the most fucking idiotic thoughts about everything and everything no subject is too minor for her notice the rug oh it's probably made of deer hide spare me 
 she is not a fucking queen her guardians are incompetent because she has been so completely fucking sheltered from the world that she doesn't understand anything but she still knows things somehow she has never seen alcohol yet she knows what alcohol smells like she knows what alcoholism looks like when she sees it in a man and she revels in being drunk cause it's just like in a book y'all 
 kelsea woke with an aching head and a parched mouth but it wasn't until breakfast that she realized it was her first hangover despite the discomfort she was charmed to experience something that she'd only read about in a book an upset stomach was a small price to pay for fiction made real 
 she cares so much for the fate of her people kelsea is so incredibly hurt that her people are being sent as slaves to mortmesne---250 a month---that she is willing to renege on the treaty between their countries within hours of her arrival to the capital kelsea makes a heroic gesture that completely endangers the peace of two nations she stops the shipment of slaves she was warned she didn't listen she risks the lives of the entire nation for the sake of a few 
 ""lady the mort treaty is specific there is no appeals process no outside arbiter if a single shipment fails to arrive in demesne on time the mort queen has the right to invade this country and wreak terror i lived through the last mort invasion lady and i assure you mhurn wasn't exaggerating the carnage before you take action consider the consequences"" 
 despite being plain kelsea is terribly judgmental of looks she criticizes an old ugly woman for daring to look beautiful she is envious of another woman's beauty despite the fact that that woman's beauty got her raped 
 kelsea complains a lot about the extravagances at court the pointless waste of money so much that she is willing to waste her valuable men's time and her own resources into traveling 2 weeks to get her books from her old home and right away it must be done right away 
 the fetch: a criminal the projected love interest a robin hood not quite you see robin hood steals from the rich and actually distributes it to the poor the fetch nah 
 ""well he's a hero to the common people lady every piece of rich man's fortune lost endears him to the poor"" 
 ""does he distribute the money to the poor"" 
 ""no lady"" 
 so um exactly how is he the hero of the common people 
 naturally she should turn him in kelsea is the queen she should set an example to her people put criminals where they belong 
 or not 
 kelsea took a deep breath ""i wouldn't betray him for any number of pounds"" 
 ""ah christ"" 
 emma emma watson i heard that you have signed up for this project i adore you you are brilliant you are gorgeous you are a goddess and you have won my heart ever since you stepped onto the screens of harry potter with your disapproving frown and your frizzy hair far more beautiful than hermione watson could ever be but i adored you then i love you now and i hope for your sake that the movie adaptation exceeds every aspect of the book because the book itself has almost no substance to offer 
 i can't even hate this book because it tries so hard it is the equivalent of having your 6-year old niece draw a picture of you sure you look like a motherfucking moose with butterfly wings for some fucking reason but hey it's an a for effort right 
 quotes were taken from an uncorrected galley proof subject to change in the final edition ""good gracious"" said alice ""i do believe i'm inside a review"" 
 she turned to the hatter and the march hare 
 ""well let me see here is the title and here is the date i read it that must be today now i need to explain the plot and the overall point"" 
 ""there is no plot"" said the march hare disagreeably 
 ""and there is no point"" agreed the hatter 
 he poured a little hot tea on the dormouse's nose making it wake with a start 
 ""the book breaks new ground"" it said rapidly in a high sing-song voice ""intentionally eluding easy assignment to any traditional category it anticipates the twentieth century's fascination with the relationship between the signifier and the signified and wittily deconstructs the primacy of meaning and the rationality of thought"" then it went back to sleep again and began to snore gently 
 ""whatever did that mean"" asked alice surprised 
 ""why is a derrida like a derriere"" replied the hatter 
 ""i don't know"" said alice 
 ""i don't know either"" said the hatter triumphantly 
 ""it would be reasonable"" said alice in the grown-up tone she had sometimes heard her sister use ""it would be reasonable for you to explain what the book is about so that i could put that in my review"" 
 ""it would be reasonable"" said the hatter ""to expect hot premarital sex in a stephenie meyer novel but don't imagine you'll find any"" 
 alice couldn't think of anything to reply to this so she turned away without another word when she was almost out of earshot she thought she heard the hatter shout something after her that might have been ""foucault"" this was justso unnecessarily wordy and pretentious i just did not enjoy it at all which makes me sad because the summary says it's for fans of harry potter game of thrones and world of warcraft aka three of my favorite things so how did i loathe this so entirely from page one i don't know ""it is our choices harry that show what we truly are far more than our abilities"" chills 
 (reread) 
 okay duh 5/5 stars i actually liked this book more than i remembered this used to be my least favorite of the harry potter books and while that still might be true i was more entertained than i expected i always forget how different book ginny is from movie ginny (way better all around) and how she has such a bigger role in the books than the films 
 now onto hp and the prisoner of azkaban now with spoilery rant @ bottom 
 hush hush is the story of nora grey an average high school student going about her business as usual -- until her biology teacher rearranges the class seating and places her next to the dangerous-looking new kid patch cipriano nora gets a weird feeling from patch and things just keep going from bad to worse as nora becomes convinced that she is being stalked and may even be the target of murderous intentions add to the list nora's strange feelings about the archangel ride at the amusement park and her constant near death experiences and well nora's life is becoming anything but average 
 when i finished reading hush hush i had to mull it over for awhile i really wasn't sure what to say i am absolutely enthralled by the cover (athletic looking darkly mysterious fallen angel contorted in mid-air in grayscale what's not to like) i had to have it because of that cover* but i had a sneaking suspicion that a cover that good had to be masking something yep it's a bright light to dazzle the eyes and make you *ahem* overlook any faults 
 it didn't work 
 inside was the most confused schizophrenic piece of writing i've read in some time becca fitzpatrick didn't seem to know quite what she wanted only that it had to be ominous and scary and dangerous -- and titillating of course and mysterious and sexy so with those buzz words in mind she threw a bunch of things together and let her narrator nora sort them out nora understandably had some trouble with this and the result is a thoroughly frustrating heroine who jumps to insane conclusions based on inane evidence one moment and the next goes blithely along into obvious danger 
 patch is intriguing and perhaps the most consistent character** and i was fully prepared for an 'anti-hero as the hero' story i wanted a little boundary-pushing and a not entirely likeable or trustworthy male lead who may or may not redeem himself but who gives you the dangerous and alluring in spades for the most part patch wasn't a let-down in this regard and as screwed up as it is to like him he was the stand-out character for me (not to say i didn't have issues with him too) 
 but it wasn't enough patch's bad boy antics couldn't save this book from itself it was self-indulgent cheesy melodramatic in the worst sense and confusing i wanted to like it; i loved the fallen angel premise the idea of an anti-hero and bits and pieces of the writing throughout but hush hush suffered from too many villains and too much shock and awe and not enough thought and follow-through maybe fitzpatrick can pull it together for round two and with some strong convincing by trusted like-minded people i may be willing to give her another chance (never gonna happen) but this was a monstrous let-down for me you've been warned*** 
 *we all know how that whole so-pretty-i-just-had-to thing works out see my guest post on jo's blog about this 
 **and by 'consistent' i mean he was consistently a douche vee was pretty consistent too and was a lot of fun but she started to get annoying and a little strange 
 ***you're still going to read it aren't you damn you james porto and your beautiful beautiful cover 
 ***here thar be spoilers*** 
 if you haven't read hush hush and intend to or if you don't want me dissing the melodrama that is patch and nora look awaynow 
 commence rant: 
 you already know i had issues with this book i think a lot of people are going to take offense to the idea of patch as the hero as teen girls' fantasy just as they did with edward in twilight patch goes beyond the simple term ""bad boy"" in that yes he does actually mean nora harm consistently 
 i'm not going to go into that because frankly i don't care he can be an anti-hero all he wants whatever if that's where the story's going fine most of my issues -- but not all -- lie with nora 
 here's the thing: 
 nora is that girl you yell at in the horror movie the idiot that goes up the stairs instead of out the door or reaches to turn over the downed bad guy just to make sure we all know that's frustrating but we've come to expect it in movies and that dumb big-breasted scantily clad girl normally gets killed off 
 nora is so much more frustrating than that 
 the many sides of nora: she continually suspects patch (and elliot and just about everyone else in this story) and with good reason however she then continually ignores her instincts and puts herself in danger in fact she can't seem to agree with herself she will think to herself that patch is stalking her and trying to kill her and then within pages think 'oh but he could never hurt me' this just cycles and cycles throughout the story 
 also throughout the story nora makes insane jumps in logic -- whether they turn out to be true or not it's not believable when she immediately jumps to the most bizarre conclusions and then acts on them at the same time she will be directly confronted with some piece of real evidence something that would make a normal non-fictional person take notice and say something's not right here -- and she will completely ignore it it's like she's being willfully obtuse 
 examples: 
 * early(ish) in the story nora hears a voice in her head and thinks patch has ""breached normal communication methods and could at will speak to me without ever opening his mouth"" naturally she thinks she's delusional hearing your name and a few inane comments would make one think they are imagining things and this i could buy even nora not being exactly sure what happened and being creeped out i could buy but she proceeds to ask patch how he's able to speak directly to her mind making her look like a loon 
 i wouldn't be even all that bothered by this if it was consistent throughout the story; if nora either consistently thought that she was going crazy because of all the implausible things that are happening i could buy it; if she wanted to prove she wasn't crazy and kept confronting patch and sleuthing i could buy it it would be 1 solid choice on becca fitzpatrick's part she could be the ultra-paranoid girl who thinks she's going crazy and jumps to conclusions about everything annoying but doable but to present this as if it's normaland i'm out 
 * conversely near the near the end of the story when the shit's really beginning to go down and nearly everyone has become a villain nora and patch walk out of a movie theater to find that ""both the tires on the driver's side were flat: '""i can't believe it"" i said ""i drove over two nails""' 
 o_o 
  
 she thinks she's being stalked she thinks her best friend has been kidnapped by a teenaged murderer named elliot and by this point she thinks she's the target of not one but two murderous angels and yet all she can come up with is that she ran over two nails come on if nora will jump to conclusions on the barest of evidence how in hell does she not comprehend the obvious 
 * throughout the story nora thinks everyone's out to get her (she's right but i'll get to that) especially patch patch is ominous capital 'o' and yetand yet no matter how much nora thinks he's badbadbad she trusts him why 
 weirdest of all when nora confronts patch about his intentions 
 he admits he wanted to kill her 
 ; her reaction 'i know patch could never hurt me' -- and she trusts him implicitly from that point on really the whole story you've suspected him and been insistent that you should stay away on the barest of evidence but once he's confessed his (albeit previous) intentions of murder you trust him 
 really 
  her sudden bizarre trust of patch comes too late for any real belief in their romance or her sanity 
 there is no consistency in nora's thinking i just can't understand why becca fitzpatrick couldn't pick one nora to write and stick with her 
 she could have just always thought she was losing her mind; self-doubt would have been interesting and made her root-forable 
 if she had just been reckless and always convinced that yes maybe something is a little off about patch but she still found herself attracted to him it would have been interesting and could have been used to slowly reveal the truth and up nora's anxiety 
 if nora had just been naive and always convinced that everything was fine despite any indicators it would have built tension 
 but combining it all made nora seem confused and a little off herself and made the writing seem schizophrenic 
 too many villains: fitzpatrick makes the rookie mistake of lack of restraint nora suspects everyone and everyone does in fact seem to be a villain this makes the book seem unfocused and sort of cheesy when everyone is under suspicion and everyone seems to be a bad guy it makes it seem like no one really is it's like if you use a really great word once or twice it's going to stand out but if every word you use is some great unusual word none are going to stand out there's no negative space no background to make the focal point pop everywhere nora turns someone's trying to kill her it just gets silly after awhile also it has the added negative effect of making it hard for fitzpatrick to ""top"" as it were where does she go from here if there are 4 different people trying to kill nora in book 1 how many people will there be out for blood in book 2 she didn't leave any room to grow the suspense 
 another bad thing about the amount of villains and nora's instant suspicion (and the overall over-the-top nature of the book) was that there was precious little suspense by giving everything away rather freely fitzpatrick deprived the reader of the slow build-up and the privilege of the mystery; we never got to have any suspicions of our own or choose sides there was too much in the way of ominous overtones and not enough restraint 
 on a side note not that i'm calling vee a villain but even she became a little weird* as the story went on it's one thing to be the wild and crazy girl in the best friends dynamic but constantly trying to get your best friend alone with a guy who she says makes her uncomfortable who she believes broke into her house and may be stalking her and who she knows was a murder suspect is reckless beyond the pale and shitty shitty friendship 
 *by which i mean she goes from being quirky and funny to a godawful shitty friend you know for no other reason than apparently to help lure nora into bad/ridiculous situations plot device: 
 the writing overall: i saw glimpses in fitzpatrick's writing that demonstrated how this could have been a good book she does sexual tension and confrontation scenes fairly well and there is some good humor vee -- in the beginning at least before she becomes a really reckless really bad friend -- was pretty amusing as the traditional sidekick patch had great one-liners both funny and smoldering 
 but for all the occasional good there was quite a bit in the way of bad the dialogue was often stilted and weird the analogies were completely out of left field they were those turns of phrase that you can tell were used because they sounded cool or because one was needed but they don't mean anything or they leave you thinking wtf ""his eyes looked like they didn't play by the rules"" what does that even mean what rules do eyes usually play by does he not blink this is a mild example but i got sick of making note of them i got this really hit-and-miss feel about the writing and the language in the book pieces of literary crap mixed in with the really good bits blended to form a ""throw it all in and something's bound to work"" style a total lack of finesse made it hard to want to keep reading -- and made me feel like if i kept rolling my eyeballs they were going to roll right out of my head 
 rant complete so much yes falling kingdoms crushed my heart but exceeded all my expectations so good if you love high fantasy do yourself a favor and read this book another amazing novel by rick riordan cant wait to start the next novel and see how this all ends this was so great i absolutely love the world building--there's a cool magic system and lots of different cities/cultures that have really fascinating dynamics the ensemble cast of characters is also fantastic they all have interesting backstories and distinct personalities writing is great story is awesome pacing on point it wasn't quite perfect but it was pretty freaking close and i can't wait for the sequel 
 if you want a fantasy book with an awesome world a well developed cast of characters and an exciting heist storyline--this is definitely the book for you my video review - https://wwwyoutubecom/watchv=rbgmr 
 this was awesome it did take me a little bit to really get into it but once i was in i was so in it was so atmospheric and i was really impressed with the details and the amount of research that had to go into writing this the time travel aspect was fascinating and just straight up cool i loved our two main characters and was so happy that we got to see from both of their povs and that ending let's just say i'm eagerly anticipating book 2 
 if you're looking for a cool time travel book or you love atmospheric stories with rich settings and historical details or if you just want to read an awesome 'questing through time' type adventure this is probably the book for you oh my god a dragon a terrible dragon who kidnaps a village's beautiful young girls do they get eaten do they get tortured what is their terrible fate 
 ""they forget how to live here[they] remember to be afraid"" my father said that was all 
 then they took their dowry-silver and left mostly they would go to kralia and go to the university often as not they married some city man and otherwise they became scholars or shopkeepers 
 are you fucking kidding me 
 *seethes* 
 i swear to god i'm the only one in the world who didn't think this book is the bestest most specialest wonderfulest book ever for god's sake emily may loved it and i highly respect her opinion but this book is one case where we will have to agree to disagree 
 frankly i have no idea why everyone loved this book and thought it was so wonderful the main character is every bit of a speshul snowflake mary sue the ""dragon"" (so very disappointing) is an asshole of the fever sort the kind i deem jericho-fucking-barrons a term used to describe an asshole who is an asshole only for the sake of being an asshole he's grumpy he's grouchy he is a huge fucking condescending thundercunt of a douchebag just for the plain old reason that he wants to be one 
 he was irritated with me every time i came into his library even on the few days that i managed to keep myself in good order: as though i were coming to annoy and interrupt him instead of him tormenting and using me and when he had finished working his magic through me and left me crumpled on the floor he would scowl down at me and call me useless 
 let's get one thing straight i like assholes (sometimes) but they have to have character for example dr house he is filled with snark he is a jerk he's oftentimes despicable but there's a spark in him a humanity in him that lets me love him and appreciate him no matter what despicable things that comes out of his mouth because under it all (and you seriously have to look deep) he is a human being with a good purpose no matter how harsh his methods 
 once again i like assholes i like anti-heroes but they have to self-redeeming the ""dragon"" in this book is none such 
 ok back to the plot it sucked i didn't really read the synopsis but i know there was a dragon who kidnapped girls in it surely a terrible fate right eeeeeeeeeehhhn wrong look at the quote at the beginning of my review essentially the girls are ""kidnapped"" by said ""dragon"" (keep in mind i used quotation marks around dragon) they're educated they become well-read and they want to spread their wings they're given shit tons of money to make a better life for themselves 
 terrifying absolutely fucking terrifying i'm quivering in my boots 
 the world building is your standard generic fantasy fare monsters kings princes but the magic the fucking magic manit just highlights what a special freaking snowflake the main character is there is nothing to catch the imagination if i shouted out ""merde"" and butterflies burst into the air and a rainbow forms at my feet it would essentially be as magical as the shit in this book 
 i whispered ""kalikual"" 
 the power rushed out of me 
 foreign words so magicalone1 
 the main character agnieszka is seriously nothing new you have read countless incarnations of her in every shitty ya book ever written because she's a special special girl who doesn't know how special she is she's just so ordinary and adorably clumsy and plain y'all the dragon always always takes the most special girl 
 the dragon didn't always take the prettiest girl but he always took the most special one somehow 
 :| <- this is my surprised face 
 and ag-noying (my new name for her) is just sosoordinary 
 at seventeen i was still a too-skinny colt of a girl with big feet and tangled dirt-brown hair and my only gift if you could call it that was i would tear or stain or lose anything put on me between the hours of one day 
 you don't say 
 but of course there's more to ag-noying than meets the eye why she's got magical power that's just waiting to burst from her like a rose from a fermenting pile of steaming poop 
 my strength welled up through my body and fountained out of my mouth and where it left me a trembling in the air began and went curling down around my body in a spiraling path 
 yeah yeah i've read this shit before and i say no thank you i like my main characters average thank you very much i like my ""dragons"" with humanity 
 1 star is a bit harsh but for all the hype this book let me down tremendously ""you ask how much of it was me"" he whispers ""some enough"" 
 dear mare stop picking the wrong brother 
 ***warning spoilers abound do not continue with this review unless you have read the book**** 
 first of all i called it i knew that we'd be getting lots of maven and seeing the boy behind the villain's mask in this one and praise the book gods i'm so glad victoria didn't let me down she gave us all those moments we hoped for the explanation the moments of fragility the tension everything she gave me a beautiful tragic tormented villain who fell in love with the wrong girl 
 i say wrong because mare does not deserve this darkling this twisted warner of a king her reaction to his kiss during the vulnerable tenuous moment between the two was what finally convinced me to give up on their love story (whereas in shatter me you could pick up on something in warner & juliette's kiss here there's nothing it's gone alright i get the message mare feels nothing but disgust it's a ""violation of the worst kind"" -she's in control and she'll never pick the villain) while i have never felt the spark between mare and cal (yup even in this book including that scene) she's never going to be maven's that's fine i'll take him mare doesn't deserve him even though maven is more like her than cal will ever be 
 this is a boy who was crippled from birth by an evil woman so terrible he doesn't know what thoughts are his i just want him to have a happily ever after but there is none this boy is darkness incarnate and i have a feeling he's going to end up doing something noble to save cal or mare or his people in the next (final) book (to redeem himself the only way a villain can) and i just can't cope 
 the first book is still my favorite but king's cage gave me so many beautiful twisted lines victoria is a master of powerful prose and she delivered some exceptional ones --as you might expect my favorite ones were his 
 ""love makes you weak and she's right i learned that before i even knew you"" 
 ""i'm not a fool little lightning girl if you're going to play in my head i'm going to play in yours it's what we're good at"" 
  i could try to write a review of this entire book but let's be honest i read it for maven and i don't have the heart to write everything up because i'm in mourning for a ship that will never sail 
 (yes i realize maven does not have blonde hair but this gif fits perfectly) 
 #teammaven my favorite book in this series so far ugh so good this is why i love fantasy so much after a recent string of okay fantasy novels a couple of good ones but nothing to get really excited about i've rediscovered my passion thanks to this book i'm so impressed and so in love i can't begin to describe it but i can try to give you a feel for the book if i can figure out where to start and how to do justice to this masterpiece 
 kvothe (pronounced like ""quothe"") is a world-renowned figure of mystery with a disreputable reputation - a hero or a demon depending on which stories you hear the real man has hidden himself away at an inn in the middle of nowhere with his apprentice bast - we know not why - and it's not until the chronicler discovers him there that he shows any interest in reliving his past life insisting that his story will take three days to tell and that the famous chronicler must write it down exactly as he tells it he begins to share his story: a child genius growing up with his parents' troupe performing plays and tricks across the land while being taught ""sympathy"" (magic) history chemistry etc by a tinker abenthy who had been to the university; to ending up homeless and penniless on the streets of treban a big port city it's not until he's fifteen that he makes it to the university and is accepted though he's three years younger than is usual abenthy has taught him well and combined with his impressive memory natural talent quick intelligence and training he moves quickly up the ranks of the university 
 there are many adventures and mishaps along the way and while some plotlines come to a tidy end at the close of this novel over-arching plotlines and themes have been given a solid foundation to continue on into the next books it took a surprisingly long time for me to realise the connection between the number of days he will take to tell his story and that this is ""day one"" in the trilogy - it's told over the course of the first day the only thing is he's young yet (chronicler judges him to be about 25 though at times he looks infintely older) and there are things happening in ""real time"" that intrude upon the story that will need to be resolved i think - so while i have every confidence rothfuss has excellent control over his creation i would love more than three books :) 
 i can't think of the last time i was this impressed by any story let alone a fantasy novel i won't compare it to bloody george rr martin like everyone else is doing because i don't see that they have anything in common really - one is a work of pure genius and the other is utter crap comparing them only heightens my dislike of a game of thrones in truth it's simply a marketing strategy to compare new books to ones that are already really popular in order to draw in a well-established audience 
 this is an epic fantasy - epic in scope - but it's also a bildungsroman a story of a person's life a life journey (including the quiet moments) which i love the character development is ludicrously good the world-building is solid believable and original - there're enough new elements to keep your interest but not so many that you get confused and overwhelmed: a perfect balance the design of ""sympathy"" is original and unique and makes so much sense that i'm half-surprised it doesn't really work it's complicated enough to not be trite but one basic premise is the connection between things the sympathy they have with each other - if you broke a branch in two the two halves would still have a connection like sharing the exact same dna and so if you control one half you affect the other half same with two pennies of the same metal so that if you were holding one and someone holding the other and they worked a ""binding"" on their half and say lifted it in the air then your penny would also lift it's fabulous it's an intellectual kind of magic not a ""wave the wand"" type it takes knowledge concentration and effort so in effect anyone could learn 
 as for the characters and their growth i am so impressed and so in love i will no doubt do a bad job of expressing it while kvothe's story is told in his voice first person the present day interludes are told in third person omniscient but usually from certain characters' points of view you get a mix of other people's impressions of characters and a gentle showing that tells us even more the genius is in how kvothe is portrayed: while telling the story himself as a young boy already having experienced tragedy and sorrow and despair and already feeling the weight of worldly concerns but still with a lot to learn comes across strongly this is counter-balanced with kvothe as a man having been through all that and more and had it shape him into something subtly different yet still very much the same person if it had been written poorly there would have been discord between the two kvothes but there isn't he has so much charisma and is such a complex sort that i really felt for him i may even have a bit of crush actually he's not good or evil but he's suffering from a conscience: he's very human and lonely despite the friendship of bast at the same time he's a god-like figure an amazing musician a skilled fighter and a powerful magician one moment he's commanding and chillingly masterful the next he's doing bast's bidding and fetching food and cutting wood for others i expect it's his contradictions and complexities that draw me to him 
 the writing style is smooth the pacing just right (though the first few chapters take a while to get you into the story you still need to read them closely because there're a lot of details in them) and the prose isn't cluttered with boring irrelevant descriptions or pointless details it's a fat book and a long story but it flies by while it needed better proofreading - there were a lot of problems with dialogue punctuation; there were a few lazy typos; he never once used a semicolon when he should have; and he always used ""lay"" instead of ""laid"" (but hey at least he was consistent) - the prose itself is engaging often humorous detailed but not overly so and never boring i also loved the little songs and ditties that are included and the stories within kvothe's story 
 likewise the way he doles out the various plots revealing and hinting at the right moments building up tension and anticipation giving clues that start to coalesce into a stunning picture is frankly impressive the supporting cast while not as fully explored as kvothe (it is his story after all) are in their own ways vividly portrayed and gradually explored there's no chunky exposition or a description of a character shoved at you all at once it's more a show-not-tell kind of book appreciating the intellect of its audience and our ability to figure things out for ourselves nicely done there was a while there when i was reading that the prose gave me the same kind of thrill as reading a sex scene in a romance novel might - but it could have just been the excitment of the story 
 one last thing (though i could go on forever): i loved what he did with dragons i won't spoil it by saying more just that it's original and delightful - this coming from someone who's been known to get a mite bored by dragons in fantasy 
 i would easily recommend this to anyone who enjoys fantasy but also to people who enjoy great stories told wonderfully well as many non-fantasy readers loved harry potter they would also love this book an ember in the ashes is truly a unique and captivating book that i recommends everybody reads cannot wait for the second book in this series =d ** spoiler alert ** 
 the wait is going to kill me 
 so rather than wait patiently i am going to gather various speculations and list facts to keep in mind 
 please take note: this review contains spoilers for books 1 and 2 
 the doors: 
 so as the third book in the kingkiller chronicle is named 'the doors of stone' it is quite obviously required of us to consider the 'doors' of which they are speaking and so as perfectionism dictates i will list every single door that i've noticed 
 in skarpi's story of lanre lanre battles a beast that while he is able to kill said beast kills lanre as well however one line is read pertaining to the beast's death that is not in fact read pertaining to lanre's 
 ""after the battle was finished and the enemy was set beyond the doors of stone"" 
 lyra of course calls lanre back this leads me to wonder if the doors of stone have something to do with death the 'doors to the afterlife' 
 kvothe mentions doors in his mind; four of them to be exact: sleep forgetting madness and death (another indication that maybe death is the 'doors of stone' to which the title is referring) this also brings me to a certain suspicion about the sleeping mind but i will return to that later 
 the main building of the university mains is quite literally described as a 'featureless stone block' this 'featureless stone block' inevitably has stone doors inscribed above these doors are the words 'vorfelen rhinata morie' 
 in the archives there are small rooms of stone for people to meet and talk (or have sex if what fela claims is true) 
 of more importance are the doors of stone that kvothe sees just before he is banned from the archives 
 ""it was quite by accident that i found the four-plate door"" 
 the door is described as 'one seamless slab of grey stone' four copper plates are on the outside flush with the stone of the door which is flush with the frame which in turn is flush with the wall it is also described as 'not a door for opening but a door for staying closed' the word 'valeritas' is inscribed upon them 
 there's a ventilation-shaft-like entrance to the archives from the underthing but i'm not sure whether or not that matters 
 elodin's cell in haven is made of stone 
 and last but not least the mauthen farm is made with stone reinforcements stone that is in fact dug up from barrows (burial mounds) in the ground and used to build the house this house was most likely destroyed by the chandrian however that has to do with a certain vase that again i will return to later 
 felurian mentions doors of stone in one of her stories 
 there are many more doors mentioned below in the comments; i don't have room to add them or edit completely 
 the king 
 so we all know that kvothe is called 'kvothe kingkiller' for a reason in fact he says that he earned the name 'bought and paid for it' 
 so nobility that is either a king or will be a king in the future: 
 at the top of our list is ambrose the first born heir to a vintish barony his father is one of the twelve most powerful men in vintas he is sixteenth in the peerage 
 lanre also known as lord haliax is a little more than nobility and i can't see him gaining power enough to be recognized as a king by others but he must be mentioned 
 sovoy is of modegan nobility 
 kvothe's mother and likely aunt meluan lackless are of vintish nobility 
 maer alveron is said to be higher in the peerage than ambrose 
 last and the most painful to admit is simmon simmon is said to be of aturan nobility; according to sovoy he is not high nobility but he is nobility nonetheless 
 i feel like kote talks about simmon's innocence so constantly as if to prove a point of surprising his audience in the end if it is simmon he ends up killing i wouldn't be terribly surprised among other references to simmon's 'goodness' is this passage: 
 '""i love you sim"" 
 he looked me over ""you're drunk"" 
 ""no it's the truth you're a good person better than i'll ever be"" 
 he gave me a look that said he couldn't tell if he was being made fun of or not' 
 the amyr 
 the amyr are a holy order of the aturan empire created to avenge the fall of myr tariniel according to skarpi they are a group of people under selitos if the stories are to be believed that hunt the chandrain the most trusted and powerful of them are known as the ciridae and their mark is a burning tower if master archivist lorren is to be believed they are equal part knight-errant and vigilante they had judiciary powers and could judge in both religious and secular courts all of them are exempt from the law in varying degrees they were also disbanded 300 years ago 
 the ruach named by aleph as the amyr in skarpi's story: 
 tehlu 
 kirel- tall burned but left living in the ashes of myr tariniel 
 deah- a woman having lost two husbands to the fighting in myr tariniel face mouth and heart are cold as stone 
 enlas- would not carry a sword or eat the felsh of animals would not speak hard words 
 geisa- fair with a hundred suitors in belen before the walls fell the first woman to know the unasked for touch of man 
 lecelte- laughed easily and often even when there was woe thick about him 
 imet- hardly more than a boy who never sang and killed swiftly without tears 
 ordal- the youngest of them all who had never seen a thing die a girl with golden hair 
 anden- a face with burning eyes his name means 'anger' 
 it is said that atreyon is one of the amyr he is in fact the one who is subject in the maer's favorite story a bloody story 
 sir savien is also mentioned as one of the amyr 
 kvothe also suspects that the duke of gibea is one of the amyr or that he worked for them at least he's a medicinal worker of great skill under the authority of maer alveron 
 ""none but the most powerful can see them and only then with great difficulty and at great peril"" 
 kvothe when he is near death in an alleyway in tarbean says that he saw a bird of fire and shadow he thought it was the bird of death come to greet him and he is about to slip away when ironically a man dressed as encanis gives him a silver talent and warms him 
 ""the last time [aleph] touched them there was pain and wings tore from their backs that they might go where they wished wings of fire and shadow wings of iron and glass wings of stone and blood"" 
 kvothe is indeed powerful and is not death the greatest peril of them all could they have in fact saved him but why to spit in the faces of the chandrain who killed his family 
 who knows why not 
 the university 
 i happened to list a few things in case i wanted to refer back to them later on: 
 master linguist chancellor 
 master rhetorician herma hemm 
 master archivist lorren (amyr) 
 master arithmetician brandeur 
 master physiker arwyl 
 master chemist mandrag 
 master artificer kilvin 
 master sympathist elxa dal 
 master namer elodin 
 the three most important rules of the chemist: 
 -label clearly 
 -measure twice 
 -eat elsewhere 
 mains is the oldest building at the university and apparently nearly as complicated as hogwarts castle 
 it came to my attention that master lorren wanted kvothe to ignore the chandrain and amyr it makes me wonder i decided that it was worthy of note 
 the three cs of sympathy: 
 correspondence: similarity enhances sympathy 
 consanguinity: once together always together 
 conservation: energy cannot be created nor destroyed 
 (sympathy is based off of the laws of thermodynamics the quantum entanglement theory and voodoo dolls) 
 alder whinn we hear went crazy at the university he now has accommodations at haven where it seems elodin has a special fondness for him he demands that whinn should be allowed to come and go as he pleases and that nothing should be added to his drink or food without his permission this i find curious 
 and the first name we hear elodin speak 
 ""cyaerbasalien"" and the stone broke or in this case i suppose the stone wall moved either way he recited the story of taborlin while he did it replacing taborlin's name with his own i will return to this later 
 auri: 
 ""i can tell you stories no one has ever heard before stories no one will ever hear again stories about felurian how i learned to fight from the adem the truth about princess ariel"" 
 could she be the princess that kvothe claims he 'rescued from the barrow kings' could she be princess ariel 
 after all she does 'pour beer as if she were among kings' 
 it is mentioned while simmon wilem and kvothe are talking of ambrose's revenge methods that a girl named tabitha 'made noise about how ambrose had promised to marry her' and she disappeared we know of a young woman around ambrose's age that lives alone on a rooftop kvothe assumes that she must have gone insane from a too weak mind at the university however ambrose seems to have friends in very high places 
 could auri be tabitha it's a weak idea sure but it's still there 
 auri gives kvothe a key and a ring could the key be the key to the 'doors of stone' 
 if you read the slow regard of silent things she's certainly important enough to the story 
 the ring is wooden which is interesting at the court in vintas in the wise man's fear wooden rings are exchanged as tokens of hatred we know that ambrose's family is from vintas how do you suppose auri came about a ring like that if the ring is in fact what i assume it to be and if my earlier theory about auri being tabitha proves true perhaps the ring came from ambrose she claims that the ring keeps secrets 
 it should also be noted that auri gives kvothe 'key coin and candle' taborlin stories mention key coin and candle as his three tools 
 auri's name is in kvothe's mother's trouper name: laurien not that that should have any significance 
 ""little moon fae"" 
 the cthaeh 
 he spoke to the cthaeh he killed a king could the cthaeh have driven him to do all of the things that he's done could the entire story merely have been created through the will of the cthaeh bast seems to think so 
 denna 
 so we all know who she is well maybe not her name exactly but we all know that whatever he real name is it stars with a d diane dyanae denna 
 it occurs to me that the lay of sir savien triliard may very well describe kvothe and denna's relationship 
 love lost than found than lost again 
 he lost her when he left the caravan he found her at the eolian as he is singing this song but where do you suppose he loses her for the last time he does obviously for she is not present at the waystone and he crushes a bottle of her favorite wine when driven to despair 
 as a side note when she and kvothe talk about the chandrian there's a pale woman mentioned could be a coincidence 
 of course the song also describes something of lanre's story he dies and loses lyra lyra resurrects him and they find each other then lyra dies and the love is lost again odd considering that savien is one of the amyr 
 there is a lot of mystery surrounding denna's patron i read theories everywhere 
 ""i think he's one of the amyr"" 
 ""i think he's one of the chandrain"" 
 ""i think it's a plot twist and he's actually a dragon"" 
 ""i think he's possessed by a skin-dancer"" 
 sovoy says when kvothe meets denna again 'for the first time' that if he promised her anything to repay her that she would order him off to find her a 'leaf from the singing tree' on the other side of the world 
 i admit it's ridiculous but when i heard singing tree i immediately thought of the cthaeh 
 kvothe also mentions felurian around the same time the 'singing tree' is mentioned 
 ""i might keep referring to you as felurian but that would lead to confusion"" 
 felurian and the cthaeh are connected if you remember 
 denna has not so far called him ""dulator"" and if i'm remembering correctly neither did felurian in wmf correct me with a direct quote and page number if i'm wrong please 
 'my first mentor called me e'lir because i was clever and i knew it my first real lover called me dulator because she liked the sound of it i have been called shadicar lightfinger and six-string i have been called kvothe the bloodless kvothe the arcane and kvothe kingkiller' 
 could there be another woman we have yet to meet 
 kote and the waystone inn 
 bast explains that you don't merely begin to believe that you are the mask you wear but you also eventually become the mask you wear he wants 'reshi' to open up to chronicler in order to remember when he was a hero he's already broken down once i can only imagine what'll happen to him next 
 it is mentioned that 'kote' means 'disaster' 
 expect disaster every seven years 
 kvothe 
 this is a small section but it has my most recent (and exciting) theory in it 
 starting with the less important notes: 
 kvothe's eyes: 
 they turn frosty green when he's terrified 
 muddy when he's in a horrible state of stress 
 dark when he's angry protective or in any way filled with adrenaline (or as kvothe jokes 'it could be just old fashioned lust' which i suppose makes sense if i'm right about the adrenaline) 
 normally they are a bright green with a gold ring around the pupil 
 he claims he gets them from his mother but his mother was dark-eyed 
 and both of his parents have dark hair whilst his is a fiery red 
 well i say he's a changeling as do many others 
 a changeling in case you are unaware is a fae infant that is switched with a human infant in order for the fae infant to grow off of the human's nourishment sort of like a cuckoo bird 
 it explains how he picks things up so quickly it explains why bastas is his student it explains why he looks so different from his parents 
 the changeling is mentioned a fair bit in faerie lore thought not yet in rothfuss's faerie lore 
 the chandrain 
 this is primarily about the pictures on the vase found by little nina at the mauthen farm the girl describes seeing a woman holding a broken sword; a man next to a dead tree; a man with a dog biting his leg; a man with white hair and black eyes (cinder most likely); a man without a face but rather a hood with nothing inside a mirror at his feet and moons in different cycles over his head (haliax); and a woman with some of her clothes off these are six of the seven 
 their signs of which i'm aware: 
 blue fire 
 rotting wood 
 rusting metal 
 the sleeping mind 
 kvothe says that the locked memories of his family are behind the doors of his mind when ambrose breaks his lute he is reminded of the breaking sound of his father's lute in tarbean which probably reminds him of his father the song the scene of his dead troupe 
 i believe that kvothe's sleeping mind contains these things and that when ambrose broke his lute he released those memories and along with them the rest of his knowledge maybe remembering is the price he has to pay to awaken his sleeping mind 
 meluan lackless 
 lady lackless 
 kvothe sings a short tune about her in the beginning of the first book when he was but a child his mother scolds him for insulting lady lackless his mother claimed that she is a real person who has real feelings 
 he meets her later and she seems familiar to him but he can't quite find out why 
 lady lackless had a sister that was stolen away from her by the ruh 
 kvothe's mother was mentioned to once have been nobility 
 kvothe might still have family 
 an aunt that shuns him for being edema ruh an aunt he barely even recognizes an aunt that if she recognizes him refuses to mention it but still she is an aunt 
 as kvothe is so fond of saying a half of a loaf is better than none right 
 the thrice locked box 
 a box to hold the name of the moon kept by jax in the old faerie story 
 a box belonging to meluan lackless that does not have a seam 
 a chest in kote's inn seamless according to bast thrice locked kvothe looks upon the chest with longing 
 elodin panics at the mention of someone changing their name referring to their true name 
 kote kvothe 
 just remove that 'v' and 'h' 
 could that chest contain 'kvothe' is that what kote wants but can't stand to think about 
 what does that box contain that is so important to him his name his shaed what 
 kvothe and elodin 
 kote is to kvothe as elodin is to taborlin 
 a possible direct parallel 
 kote is undercover at an inn elodin at a school *where he is master namer* 
 he's been to the faen realm as he so obviously reveals when he identifies kvothe's shaed he also apparently knows a smattering of ademic 
 could he have blown past the years of taborlin in fae and returned as elodin and if not do we know if taborlin had children that is if he isn't merely a story 
 but don't all stories have some truth to them 
 kvothe tries to open up to the young blacksmith boy at the inn 
 elodin tries to open up to kvothe at the asylum in a way of course he did order him to jump off a roof 
 and he tells the story of taborlin yet he uses his own name in taborlin's place shattering stone and breaking out of the prison 
 he seems young yet seems to possess knowledge of someone much older 
 maybe i'm thinking about this backwards time goes by faster for a man in fae than in real life right so if that were so wouldn't he be older than he actually is 
 of course it has flaws but it makes equal bits of sense and nonsense and ultimately it's extremely frustrating 
 other notable things 
 there are ten words to break a strong man's will could these ten word have been spoken to kvothe breaking his power 
 wisdom precludes boldness 
 ""the scrael the war all my fault"" 
 bast demands of chronicler not to ask kote why he can't do sympathy 
 the number seven 
 seven chandrain 
 expect disaster every seven years 
 seven men didn't cross to tehlu's side in trapis' story 
 ""is six a good number"" 
 ""well for a lucky number i'd have to go down to three or up to seven""-kvothe 
 it took kvothe seven days start to finish to memorize all of the runes for sygladry 
 lackless keeps seven things beneath her black dress 
 that's it for now *i received this arc in exchange for an honest review and honestly i bloodydamn loved it* 
 you think you've read a dystopian book quit lying to yourself that was teenage angst wrapped in a shiny new package cashing in on the popularity of this genre 
 you think you've read about evil futuristic regimes nope those were one dimensional villains that will look cartoony compared the assholes in this book 
 you think you've seen hurt and suffering and despair and heartache you've seen nothing 
 you think you've seen to the very depths of the depravity mankind is capable of 
 you've seen nothing 
 i won't call this book ""the next hunger games"" and nor should anyone else in my opinion but i'm sure some degenerate in a pr office will think it's a great idea my advice don't listen to that douchebag to do so would be insulting to red rising 
 don't get me wrong i loved the hunger games and there are a few parallels between that series and this book even so this book shouldn't be compared to anything this book is what it is and it stands alone on a desolate field surrounded by the burning embers of its lessers because this book is justmore it's harder darker more emotional more horrific moreeverything 
 pierce brown how the hell do you expect me to read something else after this or sit around and wait for the next installment are you writing it is it already done is it half done are you in need of an amateur editor i'm the girl for the job pick me meeeeee 
 fyi my version of editing will be to drool over whatever you produce and provide zero constructive feedback while demanding you write faster and trying to hide the intensity and frequency of my eye twitches also there may be threats involving tofu for ""motivational"" purposes 
 you probably want to know what it's about right okay i'll try to settle down 
 the story takes place on mars inside a futuristic colony our main character darrow is the youngest helldiver in memory and he operates a massive and massively complicated drill-like piece of machinery deep within the sulfurous bowels of the planet he's a red the caste of people relegated to living like moles 
 when we meet him he's under the impression that he and all of his caste are digging helium3 so that one day the surface above will be hospitable for future generations even though he's just sixteen he's married and madly in love with his equally young bride eo hearing about her through his perspective you understand why she's vibrant and beautiful and charming and witty and fierce the sunshine that lights up their subterranean world because the book blurb mentions this i don't feel like i'm spoiling anything by saying that when she dies a little piece of you may die too drained away with the tears that will spill from your eyes what will bubble up to fill the gap it leaves behind is a primeval part of yourself made of vengeance and anger 
 this monstrous little piece of you is further fueled by the lies the authorities tell the reds by the inequality and the forced brutality you're made to bear witness to by the time you reach the middle of the book you may find that savage part of you has taken over and that you've hate-morphed into a ten foot tall scale-covered ragebeast armed with razor teeth and three inch claws made for rending the flesh of the golds the highest caste and the perpetrators of all these crimes don't be alarmed it happened to me too 
 from the mines you watch darrow rise discover the truth of life on mars take his first shell-shocked steps on a city street and transform into something nearly as monstrous as your ragebeast and you're with him all the way rooting him on cheering his brilliance and his blood thirst i absolutely loved his character loved how his mind worked and you know what else i loved about him he's not perfect he's not some born leader he does horrific things makes bad choices and hard decisions but he learns from his mistakes becomes better stronger smarter 
 surrounding him is a support cast of miscreants sycophants psychopaths feral children government men who think themselves gods and the rebel leaders who wait to rise up against them none of them are one dimensional all of them pulled some sort of emotion from me whether it was love or hate or amusement or pity 
 pair these characters with the sweeping backdrop of a war whose participants have forgotten it is a game and you have one brutal and gorydamn epic novel 
 this book is a stark foray into survival and society into the heart of human darkness and the height of its heroism one part dystopian one part sci-fi and one part epic war fantasy it transcends a conventional genre and enters the realms of amazeballs 
 read it 
 this review can also be found at the alliterates here are my reviews of the previous books in this series: 
 throne of glass 
 crown of midnight 
 the assassin's blade 
 heir of fire 
 queen of shadows 
 these two girls said it all simona's review  paige's video 
 *sigh* i'm not sure where to start i've pretty much loved all the previous books in this series but aghhh this one 
 welcome to empire of storms the try not to cringe challenge book edition 
 the first thing that you notice while reading empire of storms is the similarities it has with acomaf i think that in trying to release two huge books a year sjm doesn't really have enough time to properly edit her books anymore the two books ended up sounding exactly the same except that acomaf was much much better i can imagine sjm getting to eos and being like ughhh i've already written this before 
 the sex scenes situation: i have nothing against steamy scenes in ya books i believe it makes the book more realistic and we all love seeing our otp finally getting down to business however what i don't like is seeing a ya book turn into straight up erotica 
 there's a scenes that combines my first two complaints about this book brace yourself 
 remember the mountain situation is acomaf 
 ""rhys roared as he came slamming in to the hilt outside the mountains trembled the remaining snow rushing from them in a cascade of glittering white only to be swallowed up by the waiting night below"" 
 well if rhys can make a mountain tremble imagine what good ol' rowan could do 
 ""rowan's own release barreled through him at the sight of it lightning joining wind and ice over the water 
 aelin held him through it sending the fire-opal of her magic to twine with his power on and on as he spilled himself in her lightning and flame danced on the sea 
 the lightning continued to strike silent and lovely even after he stilled"" 
 are you cringing yet  alright moving on 
 i'm so done with aelin trying to be sassy all the freaking time and bossing people around oh and is it normal that she doesn't share any of her plans with anyone 
 this book has no diversity whatsoever every single main character is straight and white af sjm has like 50 pov characters between her two series you'd think some of them would be a little different right right wrong 
 also every single character is blindingly beautiful 
 oh and let's not forget that most characters are royalty for some reason 
 you're a queen and you a king  let's throw a prince in there and another king and another queen 
 aww my gaawwd  
 chaol who 
 remember that main character we were in love with for three books 
 nop okay 
 characters acting out of character: dorian felt really off in this book he didn't sound like dorian just like chaol didn't sound like chaol in the previous book but we got rid of that problem now didn't we 
 must every single character be in a relationship 
 i'm seriously not feeling manon and dorian's relationship i had a feeling she was gay i don't know maybe it's just me 
 for some reason the narrative is mostly third person limited but we randomly jump into other people's minds here and there 
 ps: thanks for everyone who pointed out that aedion is actually bi-sexual i didn't omit this fact on purpose it just slipped my mind when i was writing the review 
 i hope i didn't forget anything anyway before you bite my head off i just want to say that i do love sjm's writing and i think the plot of this book and the series as a whole is great this book could have been amazing if there wasn't so many things annoying me about it 
 this is just my honest opinion feel free to leave a comment so we can discuss stop press:

 hope you enjoy the books ""gansey"" a pause ""that's all there is"" 
 how much can i rave about these books 
 this review contains *spoilers* 
 i've been waiting for this moment for months now but i can finally say that i've finished reading the raven king i was so nervous going into this because my expectations were sky-high but it is everything i could've dreamed it to be and more i felt like my heart was cracking throughout this whole experience 
 depending on where you began the story it was about gansey and the revelation that he knows that this might be his last year to find the king and complete his ongoing quest once and for all 
 the raven king is set a week after the events of the last book maura is back home with artemus who knows more than he is saying and is acting rather peculiar- especially when gwenllian is around and blue and her raven boys are still on their quest to find the king 
 the uncertainty over everything kept me on the edge for the entire story it felt like the end of everything 
 i was hooked as soon as i read the first sentence and i was so into the story that i couldn't stop reading until the last page (and i unfortunately had a huge headache after reading so much) 
 but i laughed i cried i mourned 
 what more could i ask of stiefvater a master storyteller 
 she creates these atmospheric impressionistic scenes with this quiet but impeccable style 
 i want everyone to know her talents but i don't want to share her with anyone 
 for the past month i've talked and ranted so much about these characters that even my mom got invested and was waiting for me to tell her what happened in the final book (by the way she said that gansey wasn't going to die) (thanks mom for believing) 
 as i mentioned before it starts with gansey's incredibly rich and unique tale and continues with his found family 
 ""where the hell is ronan"" gansey asked echoing the words that thousands of humans had uttered since mankind developed speech"" 
 what is my review worth without mentioning ronan too many times 
 but seriously he continues to amaze me and he's just an all-time favorite of mine that i won't be letting go of any time soon 
 also i'm in love with this fanart of him: 
 source 
 ""gansey asked ""do you have time to run an errand with us do you have work homework"" 
 ""no homework i got suspended"" blue replied 
 ""get the fuck out"" ronan said but with admiration ""sargent you asshole"" 
 blue reluctantly allowed him to bump fists with her as gansey eyed her meaningfully in the rearview mirror"" 
 my life i love ronan too much my new goal is for him to say the exact same things to me 
 ""for what"" 
 ""emptying another student's backpack over his car i don't really want to talk about it"" 
 ""i do"" ronan said 
 ""well i don't i'm not proud of it"" 
 ronan patted her leg ""i'll be proud for you"" 
 he's seriously the best 
 ""strange he hadn't had a premonition of what this place would become to him all those months ago "" 
 adam perfectly described how i feel about this series these books have become my home and i cannot believe it took me so long to discover i love it in a way that nearly overwhelms me with gratitude 
 i also loved that this book focused on the romance (among many other happenings) and it was slow uncertain and exquisitely written my heart is still happy and beating like crazy 
 ""each of the trees they passed sounded with a processed thud until the sound around them was the pulsing electronic beat that invariably played in ronan's car or headphones 
 ""oh god"" gansey said but he was laughing ""do we have to endure that here too ronan"" 
 ""it wasn't me"" ronan said he looked to blue who shrugged he caught adam's eye when adam's mouth quirked ronan's expression stilled for a moment before turning to the loose smile he ordinarily reserved for matthew's silliness adam felt a surge of both accomplishment and nerves he skated an edge here making ronan lynch smile felt as charged as making a bargain with cabeswater these weren't forces to play with"" 
 and while i'm on the topic of ronan i finally got to see him with his brothers and it was too good to be true i was so happy maggie included it 
 ""where are you in your room"" 
 ""dur"" 
 ""i'm serious"" 
 ""hur"" 
 ""matthew"" 
 ""yah yah i'm in my room sl hates you it's like two or sumthin' whatdya want"" 
 ronan didn't reply right away matthew couldn't see him but he was curled on his bed back at monmouth forehead resting on his knees one hand gripping the back of his own skull phone pressed to his ear ""just to know you're all right"" 
 "" 'm all right"" 
 ""go to sleep then"" 
 ""still sleeping now"" 
 the brothers hung up"" 
 ronan is seriously messing me up i love him with all my heart 
 and another favorite part in this book was when declan and ronan finally sat down and just talked 
 ""declan started: ""we need to talk about your future"" 
 ""no"" ronan said ""no no we don't"" 
 he was already most of the way out of the car leaves snapping dead under his shoes 
 ""ronan wait"" 
 ronan did not wait 
 ""ronan before he died when he and i were out together dad told me a story about you"" 
 it was wickedly unfair 
 it was wickedly unfair because there was nothing else that would have stopped ronan from walking away"" 
 why does his childhood make me cry 
 ""declan paused then sighing as if the weight of the story was a tangible thing and he needed to take a moment to regain his strength it was true that the memory of the ritual was heavy enough ronan was all tangled up in half-formed images of his father sitting on the end of matthew's bed the brothers tumbled together at its head his mother perched on that tatty desk chair no one else would sit at she loved these stories too especially the ones about her"" 
 i really love hearing about his childhood 
 ""on the outside the three lynch brothers appeared remarkably dissimilar: declan a butter-smooth politician; ronan a bull in a china-shop world; matthew a sunlit child 
 on the inside the lynch brothers were remarkably similar: they all loved cars themselves and each other"" 
 ronan and his family are unlike anyone else and i love how everyone is involved in this book and that the adults care about the kids and vice versa and nobody is excluded and it's just great great great 
 also great great great were adam and ronan: 
 ""what are you trying to find out"" 
 adam described the circumstances surrounding his eye and his hand with the same level tone he would use to answer a question in class he allowed ronan to lean in to compare his eyes - close enough that ronan felt his breath on his cheek - and he allowed ronan to study the palm of his hand the latter was not strictly necessary and they both knew it but adam watched ronan closely as he lightly traced the lines there"" 
 maggie knows exactly where to hit home for me 
 ""why are we here"" he asked 
 ""wrong devil"" adam replied quietly 
 it had not been that long since the court case against his father he knew that ronan remained righteously furious over the outcome: robert parrish a first-time offender in the eyes of the court had walked away with a fine and probation "" 
 ""what ronan didn't realize was that the victory hadn't been in the punishment adam didn't need his father to go to jail he had merely needed someone outside the situation to look at it and confirm that yes a crime had been committed adam had not invented it spurred it deserved it it said so on the court paperwork robert parrish guilty adam parrish free"" 
 i love adam and yes he continues to break my heart adam is the one i related to the most and i'm so proud of him and his character growth and i love how ronan and adam support one another 
 i was barely recovering from them when i got to see gansey and blue being so sweet all i can say is that gansey has got a way with words 
 ""it was this: gansey starting down the stairs to the kitchen blue starting up meeting in the middle it was gansey stepping aside to let her pass but changing his mind he caught her arm and then the rest of her she was warm alive vibrant beneath the thin cotton; he was warm alive vibrant beneath his blue slid her hand over his bare shoulder and then on to his chest her palm spread out flat on his breastbone her fingers pressed curiously into his skin 
 i thought you would be hairier she whispered 
 sorry to disappoint the legs have a bit more going on 
 mine too"" 
 i'm really glad he and blue stopped trying to hide their relationship from the group and gansey being as maggie said in her recap a dick but not a dick: 
 ""he gathered himself adam saw his gaze land on blue judging perhaps whether or not she knew what he was about to say or whether he should say it he touched his thumb to his lower lip caught himself at it lowered his hand 
 ""blue and i have been seeing each other"" he said ""i don't want to hurt any feelings but i want to keep seeing her i don't want to hide it any more it's eating me and nights like this having to stand here and look at blue with her face like this and pretend like --"" he drew himself to a stop a full stop a silence so intense that no one tipped any other sound into it then he finished repeating ""i cannot ask you to do things i haven't been doing myself i'm sorry for being a hypocrite"" 
 ""blue took gansey's hand 
 adam was glad she did 
 ""gross"" ronan said which was the most juvenile response possible 
 but gansey said ""thanks for the input ronan"" with a proper look on his face again and adam saw how cleverly ronan had released the tension of the moment they could all breathe again"" 
 this is exactly why i love ronan so much if anyone asked me why i would just show this one quote 
 i think this book might be my favorite in the series because so much happened and i am in awe by maggie stiefvater's ability to write something so beautiful and descriptive so exciting and so heartbreaking 
 and as she also promised in her recap henry cheng shows up more and i really liked him in this book which i honestly wasn't expecting 
 ""what are you doing here"" blue demanded she was feeling - she wasn't sure she was feeling a lot 
 ""i'm here to talk about the men in your life to talk about the men in my life i like the dress by the way very boho chic or whatever i was on my way home and i wanted to find out if you had a good time at the toga party and also make sure that our plans for zimbabwe were still on i see you tried to claw your own eye out; it's edgy"" 
 ""blue said ""i can't get in this car do you see what's happening behind me i don't even want to look"" 
 henry said ""how about you give me the finger and shout at me now and withdraw with your principles"" he smiled winningly and held up three fingers he counted to two with devil horns 
 ""this is incredibly unnecessary"" blue told him but she could feel herself smiling 
 ""life's a show"" he replied he counted one with his middle finger and then his face melted into exaggerated shock 
 blue shouted ""drop dead you bastard"" 
 ""fine"" henry screamed back with slightly more hysteria than the role required"" 
 he was such an intriguing character especially with the whole robobee situation 
 and then the book circles back to ronan and adam and i'm not freaking out or smiling or anything like that: 
 ""he wordlessly crossed the floor and sat beside adam on the mattress when he held out his hand adam put the model into it 
 ""this old thing"" ronan said he turned the front tyre and again the music played out of it they sat like that for a few minutes as ronan examined the car and turned each wheel to play a different tune adam watched how intently ronan studied the seams his eyelashes low over his light eyes ronan let out a breath put the model down on the bed beside him and kissed adam"" 
 he surprised me so much that my heart started beating too fast it was such a perfectly build up moment and i'm speechless and in love and in tears and and and time stopped for me this is giving me life right now this is giving me so much life 
 ""he was pretty sure he had just been ronan's first kiss"" 
 i reread that page so many times that i now remember every single word someone finally got kissed my favorite someone and it was such a genuine and real moment too good for words 
 i was speechless for so long but henry managed to perfectly describe how i was feeling: 
 ""his mother was the only one who knew what henry meant when he said that he wasn't good with words she was always trying to explain things to his father especially when she had decided to become seondeok instead of his wife it is that she for ever said but also something more "" 
 this is exactly how i feel when i try to explain my love for this series and the characters within 
 but then you know what's happening next the most painful moment that i dreaded and hoped hoped hoped wouldn't happen (but secretly wanted to see played out-- but also didn't) 
 ""tell me where owen glendower is"" he said to the darkness crisp and sure with the same power he had used to command noah to command the skeletons in the cave ""show me where the raven king is"" 
 ""wait you're going to junk up your nice coat white man take this"" he shouldered out of his aglionby sweater and proffered it 
 ""so you're literally giving me the shirt off your back"" gansey said swapping him for his coat he was grateful he looked up to henry ""see you on the other side excelsior"" 
 i started crying here because no henry no 
 but then gansey and the group find glendower and go in only to find it to be not as they imagined: 
 ""the only thing was that gansey had always feared that he would find glendower just a little too late minutes days months after death but this man had been dead for centuries the helmet and skull were only metal and bone"" 
 ""gansey touched the skull the raised cheekbone the face of his promised and ruined king everything was dry and gray 
 it was over 
 this man was not going to ever be anything to gansey 
 ""gansey"" blue asked 
 every minute was giving way to another and then another and slowly it sank into his heart all the way to the centre: 
 it was over"" 
 but it wasn't really 
 ""one of the great things about blue sargent was that she never really gave up hope he would have told her this but he knew it would only upset her more he said ""i can't watch ronan die blue and adam - and matthew - and all this we don't have anything else you already saw my spirit you already know what we chose"" 
 blue closed her eyes and two tears ran out of them she did not cry noisily or in a way that asked him to say anything different she was a hopeful creature but she was also a sensible creature"" 
 i was hopeful till the last page 
 ""there was no time 
 ""thanks for everything henry"" gansey said ""you're a prince among men"" 
 henry's face was blank 
 blue said ""i hate this"" 
 it was right though gansey felt the feeling of time slipping - one last time the sense of having done this before he gently laid the backs of his hands on her cheeks he whispered ""it'll be ok i'm ready blue kiss me"" 
 the power to stay quiet in the middle of the night while crying was nearly impossible especially when listening to sad music 
 ""he pulled back from her 
 out loud with intention with the voice that left no room for doubt he said ""let it be to kill the demon"" 
 right after he spoke blue threw her arms tightly around his neck right after he spoke she pressed her face into the side of his right after he spoke she held him like a shouted word love love love 
 he fell quietly from her arms 
 he was a king"" 
 maggie really knew how to destroy me i needed him back 
 ""ronan crouched beside him black still smeared on his face under his nose and around his ears his dreamt firefly rested on gansey's heart ""wake up you bastard"" he said ""you fucker i can't believe that you would "" 
 and he began to cry"" 
 ""i just don't understand"" henry said ""i was so sure that this was going to  change everything i didn't think it would end like this"" 
 ""i always knew it was going to end like this"" she said ""but it still doesn't feel right would this ever feel right"" 
 would it 
 ""the minute hand quivered it quivered again 
 blue was already tired of a timeline without gansey in it 
 adam looked up from where he was folded in the grass his voice was small ""what about cabeswater"" 
 ""what about it"" ronan asked ""it's not powerful enough to do anything any more"" 
 ""i know"" adam replied ""but if you asked - it might die for him"" 
 i seriously cannot remember a time when i've felt so deeply for a character's (near) death 
 ""the last tree fell and the forest was gone and everything was absolutely silent 
 blue touched gansey's face she whispered ""wake up"" 
 i truly applaud stiefvater for everything she managed to conclude in this book she really brought him back and ronan and adam and blue and everyone and just thank you 
 ""he closed his eyes and he began to dream"" 
 this review and more can be found on my blog it's harry freakin potter of course i love it 
 *reread in march 2017 (for the first time in like 5 years)(still wonderful) right after i finished this book i had a bit of an accident i was running with a pair of lightsabers when i tripped and fell and accidentally sliced the entire book to shreds maybe it's not a good idea to run with lightsabers 
 city of fallen angels is amazing - oh wait that was weird my keyboard cut me off this is some sort of conspiracy isn't it like the way that certain unnamed sites sometimes don't like to publish non-glowing reviews i never write those *angelic smile* oh did that angelic smile make me look like jace he's such a pretty shiny angel *sigh* 
 as i was saying this book is amazingly unnecessary i'm sorry fangirls please don't eat me 
 here is a general rundown no specific twists are revealed just vaguely referenced so possible spoilers: 
 part one 
 ch 1-2: simon talks to people jace and clary talk to each other and kiss 
 ch 3-5: simon talks to new guy jace and clary talk to each other 
 ch 6-8: clary talks to people simon and jace talk about clary 
 ch 9: jace clary and simon all make outoops i mean jace and clary make out simon bites ummmm talks to girls and has relationship issues 
 part two 
 ch 10-11: new guy is revealed dun dun dun blah blah an attack wonder woman saves the day (wow something actually happened for two seconds) vampire chat 
 ch 12-13: people talk about the vampire chat jace and clary do stuff 
 ch 14-15: jace has issues chatty chatty chatty 
 ch 16-17: jace goes emo weird stuff is revealed 
 ch 18-19: clary believes in jace things happen 
 ch 20: chatting again lovey dovey stuff but wait - someone is alive (luke skywalker scream - everyone join in with their best squeaky voice) nooooooooooo 
 i have never given out a one star rating before never so trust me i don't take this lightly at all and i don't enjoy being negative making light of a bad situation is just something i try to do however i don't like disliking things and i never try to be flat out hateful about anything to love everything would be great but that's just not realistic 
 don't just write me off as a hater and leave it at that i actually really liked the original series 
 let me explain - while knowing nothing of clare's plagiarism or the controversy surrounding the books the need for something similar to buffy overwhelmed me leading to the discovery of the urban fantasy genre my first experience with this genre was the mortal instruments which had just released the third book out of pure desperation the fact that it was a derivative was not even almost a deterrent clare told a fast-paced and action filled ya suspense which was exactly what i needed at the time 
 the first three mortal instruments had this addictive quality that made you need to read more which led me to read this one so while i still hold true to my original feelings of the first books and have a sick yet fond place in my heart for them i truly feel that this particular series should have ended where city of glass left us 
 it saddens me to think that i may have contributed to the mass production of unnecessary sequels or to clare's dragon horde of gold oh well she's rolling in it already what exactly she deserves to be rolling in i'll leave up to interpretation this is a joke no speculation is actually necessary she's rolling in money okay are you happy you better be 
 regardless of how much she has made it is respectable for anyone to make bookoos of cash doing what they love as long as they aren't hurting or taking advantage of anyone there's no problem with it although sometimes large companies can take advantage of small time authors or even gullible readers so it's a good thing that i got this from my library and didn't pay any of my own money (however my library surely made a contribution) 
 it's too bad lesser-known books and their authors don't get the opportunities and the recognition that some of these more mainstream novels do but that isn't how the industry works right now hype sells controversy sells 
 fellow girl-power groupies: don't kill me i liked jace in the original books but i soon realized how destructive this small adoration can become 
 now fangirl mobbing is truly my greatest fear so i don't want to piss anyone off but jace is prick a hot one yes and i readily admit to secret desires of being pursued by a ""bad boy"" but seriously calm yourselves he's fictional 
 by the way that girls talk about him you would think that his saliva is made of awesomesauce 
 or that his face is made of the ark of the covenant don't look directly at him your skin might melt off 
 i wanted to like this and wanted my jace crush to transfer over to this book i swear i did and maybe i was prepared to not like it because of a few certain friend reviews *cough* jillianhellionmajavinaya *cough* but i tried really enjoying this just wasn't in my power 
 objectivity is something we should all strive for with every read even after hearing bad things about a specific book one can still have an open mind when reviewing we aren't trying to prove anyone right or wrong we are just giving our own impressions about the book 
 sometimes when an avid reader reads a mega-hyped book such as this we can take on a similar persona to that of bill and ted they are all about the excellent adventure first and foremost with ya fantasy - we mostly want to be entertained all the better if we learn something or absorb a good message while doing it but the entertainment part is essential 
 why i didn't like this book 
 not funny at the time i thought there was quite a bit of good humor in the originals this one: nada or maybe i've just outgrown it the corners of my mouth never even lifted in fact a scowl probably made an appearance or twoor twenty this book is to ""funny"" what vampires are to ""real"" (hint: they aren't) 
 not entertaining every few pages i felt the need to go for a spin in my car with my head hanging out the window just to stay awake the suspense the tension the action - everything i liked about the originals was gone i'd say this book is about 1% action 99% chatting i may have entertained myself about this book but this book did not entertain me not for one second 
 not new this was a rehash of every conversation jace and clary and simon had in the first books that took up an entire book clary i love you but i can't because i think i'm evil jace you're so emo simon you're my best friend this is a repeat a rerun and not even a funny rerun it's like that sucky episode of friends with alec baldwin in it that no one cares to remember 
 not inspiring unlike most of my favorite books there wasn't anything to take away from this book if we are not going to be entertained then shouldn't we at least learn something or feel like we derived some deeper meaning from the book 
 both ender's game and the hunger games had serious messages about war the giver teaches us that human emotion is essential to our lives what did city of fallen angels teach us serious spoiler ahead dont click unless you really want to know that it is okay to be a prick because you've been possessed by a demon maybe there was some deeper message and i just didn't see it because i was so bored if so i apologize for my oversight 
 let's end on a high note shall we so i'll leave you with this: 
 even if i don't particularly like a book i can usually find something good about having spent my time on it this one was much more difficult to find that ""good part"" but i still managed to 
 so despite not laughing once as a result of a joke in the book i found myself alone laughing hysterically in my room about how horribly pointless this book was or about random crap that i find funny usually involving jace and clary somehow i managed to amuse myself 
 seriously dumb stuff dances through my head like a frisky stallion does through a meadow full of unicorns i wonder if jace is part unicorn because unicorns are made of awesomesauce and rainbows i bet jace is made of rainbows or at least clary seems to think so - just wait until she figures out that he has no pots of gold 
 and before i go find something awesome to read i have something to ask you: 
 question: quick both jace and clary are drowning you can only save one what should you do 
 answer: let them both drown and read a different book this was funny and weird and fascinating and i had such a good time reading it i just loved seeing how everything unfolded from this different perspective it made twilight fresh and exciting again and i really enjoyed it ""i'm going to keep going until i succeed -- or die don't think i don't know how this might end i've known it for years"" -- harry potter 
 most seventeen-year olds don't view the possibility of an early death as being well possible but then again most seventeen-year olds haven't come face-to-face with death almost half a dozen times before their first kiss either 
 in harry potter and the deathly hallows the seventh and final installment of the ridiculously popular harry potter series jk rowling brilliantly ties up every loose end that she has planted over the last ten years since the very first outing of the series was published in 1997 truly rowling has learned exactly what her fans want and subsequently delivers a book that answers every potterhead's questions -- and then some 
 not only does deathly hallows revisit key places and characters from all of the previous six books but rowling even manages to make clever references to previous bits of dialogue from her earlier books case in point: near the end of the first potter book after hermione fails to see the magical solution to saving the trio from a nasty patch of devil's snare harry's best mate ron bellows ""have you gone mad are you a witch or not"" now six years later hermione finally gets her revenge on her red-headed friend when ron believes that all is lost until hermione yells to him ""are you a wizard or what"" thus reminding ron to use his wand to solve their problem subtle references such as this are a large part of what makes rowling's books so enjoyable to re-read as there are always deeper meanings and additional allusions that are often only discovered via multiple read-throughs 
 harry's bold statement regarding his own potential death is also a prime example of how much rowling truly wrote harry's last tale for her long-time fans this line seems to read as a secret ""shout-out"" to the potterites who have also known for years that the series might not end happily ever after the prophecy in the fifth book revealed that ""neither shall live while the other survives"" and therefore by the end of book seven either harry or voldemort had to die rowling cleverly fills her last installment with so many twists turns and complications however that it becomes practically impossible to determine which way this book is going to end 
 more than any of the other potter books deathly hallows is a true quest narrative with the trio spending the majority of the story hunting for horcruxes and hallows whilst evading capture by voldemort's death eaters the multiple close-calls that all three main characters find themselves in throughout the book add to the tension that continues to build until the predictably bloody battle at the end of the tale the book does after all chronicle a brutal war so be prepared for a lot of killing and consequently a lot of tears 
 this is not to say that deathly hallows doesn't offer up a great deal of laughs as well the hilarious twins fred and george weasley make several appearances to ensure that the book isn't all doom and gloom by far the funniest part of the story is the secret radio show potterwatch anonymously hosted by former hogwarts quidditch commentator lee jordan with special appearances from fred george and ex-defence against the dark arts professor remus lupin rowling perfectly mixes this blend of humour tragedy and adventure so that her epic-length novel never lags or drags 
 to write a 607 page book that millions of die-hard fans around the world are able to devour in less than 24 hours is no mean feat but rowling's farewell to the boy who lived is an incredibly gripping page-turner that will leave all potter lovers immensely satisfied before i start my review can we just take a minute to admire this beautiful piece of art featuring my favorites:

 ""i will have you without armour kaz brekker or i will not have you at all"" 
 this review contains *spoilers* 
 the wait for this grandiose sequel has been all-consuming i've been thinking about the dregs for months and months now so getting back into their lives has been one of the most rewarding experiences 
 the book opens on wylan still wearing kuwei yul-bo's features since nina didn't trust herself with her powers now it had been just under a week since the dregs reached ketterdam almost a month since they'd left djerholm and they're all fighting to get inej back before van eck could have his way with her 
 they were almost out of time but none of them knew the real game kaz ""dirtyhands"" brekker - the smooth smart criminal mastermind - was running 
 and so piece by piece the plan to rescue inej had come together 
 things were about to get dangerous 
 ""why do you guys say that anyway no mourners no funerals why not just say good luck or be safe"" 
 ""we like to keep our expectations low"" 
 literally one of my most pressing questions for the sequel was answered so quickly 
 but the days until van eck's deadline were dwindling and to get inej back they would need surprise on their side only one shot at getting the wraith out of this situation 
 but before all that can happen we get to read from the pov of my favorite warrior: inej ghafa legend of the barrel and let me tell you she is one of the most strong and determined and courageous characters i've known so watching her doubt herself and her saints damn near broke me what she had to go through in her first chapter left me both shaking and trembling ghafa has my soul heart and my enter being wrapped around her pinky 
 ""when fear arrives something is about to happen"" 
 meanwhile the dregs have gathered enough intel to get their girl the hell out of van eck's hole i felt truly terrified for inej because that brute managed to get into her head but she was done being frightened of this man and so was i--thanks to both her and the man of the hour my favorite bastard of the barrel: kaz brekker with that demonic cane 
 you know i forgot for a second there just how dark he can be when it comes down to business but he's called dirtyhands for a reason and we're reminded just exactly what he had done to earn his reputation 
 ""sometimes the only way to get justice is to take it for yourself"" 
 i'm still furious at myself for believing that that smug merch son of a bitch could outthink kaz brekker and with the help of his loyal dregs they manage to get inej of out harm's way but not without trouble coming their way the kind of trouble even jan van eck hadn't foreseen: shu with wings () looking to hunt and capture grisha 
 but the deal is the deal and van eck has to pay up--dirtyhands is not someone to piss off they'd set out to get inej back from van eck and they had but they're not done with the merch and the plan the dregs have set is so intricate that it will be the end of the van eck empire without a shadow of a doubt 
 okay so here's the official plan to both earning their thirty million kruge and obliterating the devil himself: they're going after van eck's sugar crop since he controls the silos where the supply is produced: 
 * thanks to wylan's weevil they can destroy the sugar in van eck's silos without being exposed 
 * ""my father can weather a loss the other merchants the ones who own the sugar in his silos will be hit worse"" 
 * and once the other merchants learn that van eck has been buying up sugar that isn't stored in his silos (thanks to kaz purchasing shares on behalf of van eck) his reputation will be annihilated 
 ""van eck's reputation will take a hit when the sugar is lost but when the people who paid him to keep it safe find out he profited from their loss they'll look more closely at those silos"" 
 ""and find the remnants of the weevil"" finished wylan 
 ""destruction of property tampering with the markets"" inej murmured ""it will be the end of him"" 
 * they'll get the weevil into the silos by letting tiny and ferocious inej do what she's best at: climbing up twenty stories high and walking a high wire from one silo to the nextno biggie 
 * and while doing all of the above they're also going to get the rest of the grisha out of the city at nina's request 
 a ship to ravka with twenty passengers (including kuwei) is conspicuous so they're going to steal van eck's own transport to remain obscure they couldn't just be smarter than their opponent they had to be relentless 
 * i just why is everything so damn complicated with the dregs they're nothing if not ambitious 
 ""you couldn't go to war with an upstanding merch like van eck not if you were a thug with a reputation dirtier than a stable hand's boot sole to win kaz would have to level the field he would show the world what he already knew: despite his soft hands and fine suits van eck was a criminal just as bad as any barrel thug--worse because his word was worth nothing"" 
 it's a known fact that kaz brekker is a smooth smart criminal mastermind but he also hurts for his big criminally inclined family and watching him realize just that was one of my most cherished scenes 
 ""he was going to break my legs "" she said her chin held high the barest quaver in her voice ""would you have come for me then kaz when i couldn't scale a wall or walk a tightrope when i wasn't the wraith anymore"" 
 dirtyhands would not the boy who could get them through this get their money keep them alive would do her the courtesy of putting her out of her misery then cut his losses and move on 
 ""i would come for you"" he said and when he saw the wary look she shot him he said it again ""i would come for you and if i couldn't walk i'd crawl to you and no matter how broken we were we'd fight our way out together--knives drawn pistols blazing because that's what we do we never stop fighting"" 
 i cant stop thinking about this without getting goosebumps damn you kaz 
 you know speaking of which wylan finding out that his mother was still alive and in an insane asylum because of rotten van eck made me want to string his father up in a barren field and let the vultures have at him to quote jesper 
 but seriously that whole situation made my heart race i couldn't believe to what levels of evil van eck would sink the only silver lining was the whole plan kaz had in store for the devil and hopefully seeing wylan reunite with marya hendriks i'm always weak for stories reuniting mother and son always 
 also jesper trying to cheer wylan up made me shed a tear or two 
 ""hey"" jesper said giving him a shake ""hey your father could have made a lot of choices when he found out you couldn't read hell he could have said you were blind or that you had trouble with your vision or better yet he could have just been happy about the fact that he had a genius for a son"" 
 ""i'm not a genius"" 
 ""you're stupid about a lot of things wylan but you are not stupid and if i ever hear you call yourself a moron again i'm going to tell matthias you tried to kiss nina with tongue"" 
 wylan wiped his nose on his sleeve ""he'll never believe it"" 
 ""then i'll tell nina you tried to kiss matthias with tongue"" 
 they seriously deserve the world and so much more they all did 
 this was them at their best 
 and then halfway through the book the plan suddenly changes because ketterdam has turned on kaz ""but if you couldn't open a door you just had to make a new one"" and that's what dirtyhands excels at 
 ""i know how to do it"" kaz said slowly ""how to get kuwei out get the grisha out get our money beat van eck and give that son of a bitch pekka rollins everything he has coming to him"" 
 nina raised a brow ""is that all"" 
 ""how"" asked inej 
 ""this whole time we've been playing van eck's game we've been hiding we're done with that we're going to stage a little auction right out in the open"" he turned to face them and his eyes gleamed flat and black as a shark's ""and since kuwei is so eager to sacrifice himself he's going to be the prize"" 
 my heart leapt like a horse clearing a jump kuwei is going to auction himself with the hopes that the ravkans will end up buying him it was the best chance they had of getting kuwei to ravka and saving grisha lives to quote brekker it was a mad spiky monster of a plan and that was what it had to be for them to succeed 
 seriously though how does bardugo keep up with herself there were so many twists and turns that left my mind spinning even after having closed my eyes the whole storyline is just so lancing--we know where the end-game is supposed to be but to get there the dregs would have to go through hell and back and damn that they did 
 but before hell comes their way kaz and inej share an intimate moment that left me undone he had gone to great lengths to prove he was capable of anything 
 ""the sickness was there the need to run the need for something else too kaz thought he knew the language of pain intimately but this ache was new it hurt to stand here like this so close to the circle of her arms it isn't easy for me either after all she'd endured he was the weak one but she would never know what it was like for him to see nina pull her close watch jesper loop his arm through hers what it was to stand in doorways and against walls and know he could never draw nearer"" 
 i'll be 100% honest this choked me up a little bit 
 ""before he even knew what he intended he lowered his head she drew in a sharp breath his lips hovered just above the warm juncture between her shoulder and the column of her neck he waited tell me to stop push me away 
 she exhaled ""go on"" she repeated finish the story"" 
 my heart should not be making that sound 
 ""the barest movement and his lips brushed her skin--warm smooth beaded with moisture desire coursed through him a thousand images he'd hoarded barely let himself imagine--the fall of her dark hair freed from its braid his hand fitted to the lithe curve of her waist her lips parted whispering his name 
 all of it there and then gone "" 
 this is heaven what i truly want i have no words to thank you for this 
 seriously leigh can write evocative raw and hauntingly powerful scenes like nobody's business 
 ""two of the deadliest people the barrel had to offer and they could barely touch each other without both of them keeling over but they'd tried he'd tried maybe they could try again"" 
 they truly deserve their happy ending 
 but in the end it all came down to this: ""brekker his wraith queen his rotten little court of thugs"" because no matter what would happen the dregs had a way of rewriting their own rules 
 i mean that ending that ending was every bit as epic as i had anticipated it either would've gone brilliantly or in total disaster but that's generally the way this crew likes to work 
 also one last minor thing: i was on the edge the whole time to see who would survive even though the table of contents kind of gave away who lives who dies who tells their story but i cannot for the life in me believe matthias helvar got killed off by a young druskelle this is not what i want this is not what i planned 
 ""after all their mad escapes and close calls he'd started to believe the six of them were somehow charmed that his guns kaz's brains nina's wit inej's talent wylan's ingenuity and matthias' strength had made them somehow untouchable they might suffer they might take their knocks but wylan was right in the end they were all supposed to stay standing 
 ""no mourners"" said jesper surprised by the ache of tears in his throat 
 ""no funerals"" they all replied softly"" 
 my eyes burned tears streaming down my cheeks i was whispering ""come back to me"" right there with nina 
 i just i was rooting for everyone to have their happy ending everyone so this death came as such a shocking reveal i felt sorrow dragging at my heart for hours after that and i'm still not over it 
 this saintsforsaken book has taken away a piece of my heart with that ending i've got this ache in my chest that won't go away i want to be free but i know i won't be forgetting the dregs anytime soon 
 5/5 stars

 this review and more can be found on my blog okay i'll admit it i haven't read the whole anthology but i'll admit i'm rather proud of the story i've got in here it's called ""the lightning tree"" 
 it's got bast in it the heat of the incinerator wrapped around inej like a living thing a desert dragon in his den hiding from the ice waiting for her she knew her body's limits and she knew she had no more to give she'd made a bad wager it was as simple as that the autumn leaf might cling to its branch but it was already dead the only question was when it would fall 
 let go inej her father had taught her to climb to trust the rope the swing and finally to trust in her own skill to believe that if she leaped she would reach the other side would he be waiting for her there let go inej should she jump now or simply wait for her body to give out 
 my mind is spinning i tend to prefer simplicity in books i hate a ridiculously complicated plot i hate unnecessary characters for the young adult genre this book can best be described as epic because it is huge it is complicated it's like 
 ocean's eleven 
 for the ya fantasy crowd in the very best of ways 
 there are 6 main characters typically that's 4 more than i'd like the book's downfall is also what makes it great and it's why i docked a star it's epic perhaps too epic too complicated books tend to confuse me and let's face it a large cast with different povs tend to make it extremely confusing for the reader - and it is to an extent true in this book it is nonstop action with nary a moment to breathe there is a cast of characters in the beginning and by god you'll need it sometimes i felt like i was memorizing things for a test 
 but the good is that the characters are all bad-ass the packleader is an anti-hero which in my opinion is the best kind of character 
 kaz narrowed his eyes ""i'm not some character out of a children's story who plays harmless pranks and steals from the rich to give to the poor"" 
 i like them dirty and the book moves at a breakneck speed that'll guarantee the reader's interest 
 there's magic - naturally but a different kind of magic than such was found in the grisha the characters are well-written they're a ragtag band of misfits and not exactly friends but all are united for a common mission and most importantly they each have a purpose there are no redundant extraneous characters but each character is doing this for their own reason 
 four million kruge freedom a chance to return home she'd said she wanted these things but in her heart she couldn't bear the thought of returning to her parents could she tell her mother and father the truth would they understand all she'd done to survive not just at the menagerie but every day since could she lay her head in her mother's lap and be forgiven what would they see when they looked at her 
 the female characters are kick-ass they're feminine but not useless they don't try too hard to be rebels to be bad-ass to deny their own nature to prove they can play with the boys they're just themselvesthat's confusing i know but i can't describe it any other way 
 there is romance but so little of it and what little there is felt natural and unobtrusive a blossoming from grudging tolerance to like to possibly something more but i consider this a great book because the romance is not intrusive in any way 
 every time she moved the reindeer cloak parted revealing a flash of round calf white skin the shadow between her breasts it was deliberate he knew it she was trying to rattle him he needed to focus on the fire he'd almost died and if he didn't get a fire started he still might 
 nina snorted and lay down in the nest of pelts propping herself on one elbow ""for saint's sake druskelle what's wrong with you i just wanted to be warm i promise not to ravish you in your sleep"" 
 ""i'm not afraid of you"" he said irritably 
 her grin was vicious ""then you're as stupid as you look"" 
 he stayed crouching beside the fire he knew he was meant to lie down next to her the sun had set and the temperature was dropping he was struggling to keep his teeth from chattering and they would need each other's warmth to get through the night it shouldn't have concerned him but he didn't want to be near her because she's a killer he told himself that's why she's a killer and a witch

 (heads up: my goodreads review is spoiler free but hopefully later this week i'll be posting my spoiler-filled and probably way too long video review to my youtube channel: youtubecom/emmmabooks) 
 lord of shadows is the sequel we've all been waiting for it has the same amount of high-intensity beautifully constructed and deep yet comedic content we love to see from the shadowhunter chronicles  lord of shadows delves deeper into the shadowhunter world than we've ever seen before from the repercussions of the cold peace the rising tensions between downworlders and shadowhunters to the nuclear bombs waiting to detonate between character relationships everything about this series expands into a bigger and better tale than i could have anticipated i had so many theories going into this book and while some were confirmed some were *basically* correct others were thoroughly off but the execution was much greater than anything i could have imagined anything i could have asked for was either delivered as i wanted or something i didn't even know i wanted until it was given to me 
 i loved that we were able to get more perspective from a variety of other characters (kit ty livvy dru & diana) while i feel every character in this series has grown from book one to two it really was a pleasure to learn more about this specific set of characters and get to know them better we do also get four cameos from tmi characters which i was totally satisfied with and happy to see but i do specifically feel that emma julian mark and cristina have done more maturing than most i just feel that with all the burdens each of them carry they begin to face them head-on which made me very proud i think any reader who loves the tda characters will be impressed with the character development in the sequel 
 as per usual the plot of the next installment of the shadowhunter chronicles is insane i love how effortlessly the stories of tmi tid even a bit of tlh and somethings i can allude to for twp are implemented into the present series i loved all of the different journeys our protagonists went on; from london to cornwall to faerieland to idris there's so much adventure and excitement to love of course within that comes all of the devastation which no one is prepared for but still flawlessly written nonetheless 
 as always i have to applaud cassie for continuing to grow and improve her craft i truly believe every single book in the shadowhunter chronicles gets better and better as the story deepens i'm particularly impressed because i saw risks with lord of shadows that weren't always taken in past books and i stand by all decisions made (yes even each of the deaths) i'm satisfied elated heart-broken and blown away all in one 
 of course i'd highly recommend reading lord of shadows i cannot wait for you all to experience this story i go so emotional at the end so good 425 wow woo hoooo feyre is rock this book is rock 
 bwahahahaha feyre my girl that's it that's it yesss *dies* the next book *dies* rhys rhys my mineeee love it romance night court this book yes yes <3 45 
 i loved this a review will be up on my channel on friday (obviously a reread) *cries* i didn't enjoy this book as much as i should have i kept distracting myself with the thought ""why the hell haven't i read more of neil gaiman's books"" then i would have to tell myself to shut up because i'm reading one right now and i can return to berating myself later 
 neil gaiman really understands fantasy he understands that it isn't elves dancing in a forest and drunk dwarves mining for gold with improbably well maintained beards no fantasy is a reflection of reality but fantastic it isn't an alternate reality but reality through the lens of imagination and possibly some mind altering substances 
 not only does he capture the essence of fantasy perfectly but he does so with the trickiness and charming language that seems to be uniquely in the realm of british humorists he rarely describes anything in a completely straightforward manner instead choosing to almost fool the reader into visualizing his delightful (or when appropriate very undelightful) characters and events 
 i couldn't help but to be completely charmed by and immersed into london below right up until the point when some jackass started to wonder ""why the hell haven't i read more of neil gaiman's books"" 
 ============== 
 so a few years later and a lot of people seem to like this review still i've decided to abuse the popularity of this review to attempt to steer fans of neverwhere towards a few other books that i think they will enjoy despite the theme of the review being ""read more neil gaiman"" the books listed below are actually by different authors since i think i've already made it clear that you should read more neil gaiman so aside from all of those here are a few other recommendations: 
 1 bridge of birds by barry hughart - an epic hilarious mythological adventure 
 2wool by hugh howey - a pretty dark and serious tale of people living underground on a ruined world 
 3 the baroque cycle by neal stephenson - a globetrotting adventure set among a lovingly researched historical backdrop 
 4 little brother by cory doctorow - a nerd finds himself suddenly and unexpectedly being stalked by his own government and doesn't think it's so cool oooooooooh sooooooooooo goooooooooooddd hidden oracle 
 so fun and hilarious 
 i heart apollo 
 (a haiku book review in honor of the god of poetry) sigh i just can't cassandra clare's extra jem & tessa story 
 after the bridge: the full story (jem/tessa) 
 http://cassandraclaretumblrcom/post 
 okay so i'm pretty sure anything i say will be a spoiler since everyone knows how hardcore i ship jem & tessa so my reading thoughts will be in the spoiler tag 
 do not read it if you do not want to know what happens 
 also warning that the comments of this post now have spoilers 
 i'm also going to start posting spoiler fan art there so keep away from the comments of this review until you finish reading 
 you can dm me to discuss the spoiler stuff 
 but keep calm jessa fans and wait for the epilogue :-d 
 dying to know what people think of the ending i don't know whether to love it or hate it i mean it feels like a cheap ploy to keep both sides happy but i feel like i should just be happy with that the epilogue is a jessa shippers dream come true but even though it is technically a happy ending i was balling my eyes out through the entire book i mean jem was so sweet adorable loving selfless and perfect he didn't want anyone to get hurt over him and just loved with all his heart he is seriously like the most perfect character ever <3 omg i love you james carstairs i cried when he found out about will's feelings and said he would have broken off the engagement i cried when he said that he wanted tessa to grow to love will i cried when he said he wanted to see charlotte's baby i cried when he said silent brotherhood was his only choice then i really seriously balled my eyes out when jem said goodbye to tessa and will they had to live without him omg then i as so happy during the epilogue that i cried some more finally 130 years later he gets to have a happy life with tessa i wonder if we will get to see him and tessa together in the mortal instruments or the dark artifices i'm still kind of confused by the timelines of all this i believe mortal instruments is 2007 and the epilogue was 2008 so maybe a chance for dark artifices 
 so things that did piss me off really jem was dying and tessa didn't sleep with him but right after they thought jem died she slept with will because she thought he might die and then at least after that they took time but i thought it was because will was giving tessa time to grieve and himself time to grieve but really he was just scared that tessa wouldn't love him like she did jem well of course not because jem is so much better than you but whatever will died and now tessa is with jem over all her lifetime with will and 71 years after his death she still never stopped loving jem or wearing his necklace awwwwwwww

 ""i've been to her"" will said ""something's frightened her so badly she won't even crawl out of her grave"" 
 woolsey snorted ""and that doesn't tell you anything little shadowhunter is it really worth all this just to stretch your friend's life out another few months another year he will die anyway and the sooner he dies the sooner you can have his fiancee the one you're in love with"" he cut his amused gaze toward tessa ""really you ought to be counting down the days till he expires with great eagerness""

3,history," quick question: if this book has a quarter of a million ratings and still maintains an average rating of 4.13, why the hell are the most popular reviews the snarky, mean spirited, one or two star reviews? that doesn't match up at all with what i'd assume would be the case, which is that most people who read this book loved it. including me. 
 please, people. if you enjoy a book, click ""like"" on the good reviews as well. that's what people see first when they look for reviews on goodreads...the ones with the most popularity, or ""likes"". sad that this amazing book's two most populare (and therefore most visible) reviews are not in keeping with most people's thoughts.

 summary: 
 claire is happily married. she and her husband are visiting scotland and soaking up the history while indulging in some much needed time alone. one morning, they are witness to a group of women performing a ritual at a nearby stone circle. 
 ""they should have been ridiculous, and perhaps they were. a collection of women in bedsheets, many of them stout and far from agile, parading in circles on top of a hill. but the hair prickled on the back of my neck at the sound of their call. 
 (the modern witches at the stone circle...spooky and oh, such a good mood setter!!!) 
 claire returns to the circle later. i wonder if she felt called to that magical place, as if fate had plans for her and she was simply following her destiny. 
 the tallest stone of the circle was cleft, with a vertical split dividing the two massive pieces..."" 
 without warning, and for no apparent reason, claire is whisked back to the year 1743. 
 i could say that my field of vision contracted to a single dark spot, then disappeared altogether, leaving not darkness, but a bright void. i could say that i felt as though i were spinning or as though i were being pulled inside out. all these things are true, yet none of them conveys the sense i had of complete disruption, of being slammed very had against something that wasn't there."" 
 there she meets james fraser, a man who is as complex as their relationship turns out to be. claire never stops trying to get back home, but this world of the past and her present is slowly beginning to sink into her. she must now decide between remaining faithful to a man she may never see again, or conceding to the realization that she will forever remain in this time, with this fascinating man who has become her fiercest protector.

 it's pure craziness to me how this book can be summed up in a couple of paragraphs. and it's both detrimental and beneficial that a summary simply cannot encompass the sheer scope of heart that is in these pages. i was absolutely unprepared. 
 why detrimental? because the details did become tedious, even as they were adding to the story. the downtime...instead of a time of building anticipation, became a time of hurry up and wait. this is the only reason that i can't give this five stars...because, for a couple hundred pages, i was 'a wee bit' bored. and i hope that my saying this won't keep someone from reading it. i wish that i didn't have to mention it, but in order to be fair and honest, i feel like it's necessary, if only to keep someone's expectations from becoming too high. 
 and to be totally confusing, it's the details that drag you down into the middle of the eighteenth century, the minor secondary plots that make you live this life for awhile. so i'm not certain that they weren't necessary. i do wish that we got more of claire dealing with the mundane things, but she just never seems bothered enough with inconveniences to mention them. 
 i don't want to do much of a character breakdown except for maybe the three big key players in this story. 
 ~`*`~`*`~`*`~`*`~`*`~`*`~`*`~`*`~`*`~`*`~ 
 claire... 
 ""you're no verra sensible, sassenach, but i like ye fine."" 
 oh boy. i had heard that a lot of people didn't like claire at first. and to be quite honest, for most of the book i really did like her. she was fairly steadfast to her husband...although circumstances bieng what they were, it would have been nearly impossible for her to stay that way. this was a fascinating look into what it must have been like for a woman back in those times. not quite the dark ages but boy, they were a far cry from modern women's rights. this was a time of witch burnings and mob mentality. imagine what it would be like to go back to these times, knowing what we know now, remembering what took place in history, and being scared to death to be female. you're completely at the mercy of the men you are with. thank goodness claire stumbled upon jamie. 
 her character did fluctuate for me, for obvious reasons. i had a few minor hiccups with how wishy washy she was at times, and how little she seemed to think about how her actions would affect jamie. however, i do think that she had no idea how passionately jamie felt for her until near the very end. so why would she feel the need to constantly spare his feelings and put him first? at some point, she has to think of herself. the time frame in which all of this happens is not exactly conducive to accepting her fate and giving up on her whole life before scotland. so i felt like i could cut her a break. she has an awful lot to deal with and i feel like she did the best she could. and toward the end...she becomes just as much a hero as jamie does. you just have to wait for her to build up to this amazing person that she was meant to be. 
 ~`*`~`*`~`*`~`*`~`*`~`*`~`*`~`*`~`*`~`*`~ 
 jamie... 
 yes, i swooned, i gushed, i loooooooved jamie fraser! who wouldn't? who would admit to it if they didn't? however, he is really not at all what i expected. i like the badass boys, the heroes, the heartbreakers, those men who make you wonder if they will ever be tamed. i like men on the edge of good and evil, the ones that you are always unsure of. but there's just something about the nice guy, the man who...as soon as you meet him, you know his heart is pure and good. there are no questions with regards to jamie about his purity of character. he's the epitome of good. he's a great mix of beta male (somewhat in the background, not horribly outspoken, usually backup for the leaders) and alpha male (leader, loud and proud, tends to be bossy and pushy.) i expected jamie to be a more stand out guy but honestly, it was all in the ""knowing"" of jamie that made me fall for him. he is one of the most honorable, strong minded, tender, loyal and devoted fictional men i've ever, ever read about. as jamie himself puts it, he ""i havena the taste for power at the cost of other men's blood."" all of these romance heroes that we read about...the dukes and lords and lairds and such...all of the battles and death and heartache...they're entitled to their place in society, to revel in their own sense of power and self-righteousness. jamie just wants peace, a home, his wife, and a good life. simple but so powerful. if only more people felt that way, if only more men were heroes because of the battles they didn't fight. 
 claire tending to jamie's shoulder... 
 ""ye need not be scairt of me,"" he said softly. ""nor of anyone here, so long as i'm with ye."" 
 that is not to say that he was perfect. one big, huge point of contention for me was when he beats claire after she tries to find the stone circle and instead ends up getting captured. i don't care what year it is, that's never right. to beat her until she can't sleep, can't sit down, and then allow his men to make fun of her for days afterward while she is healing... this is one of the more cruel things that i've ever forgiven a hero for. i suppose if i'm going to forgive, it may as well be james alexander malcolm mackenzie fraser.

 randall... 
 i truly think that he is not only one of the most vile, heartless, disgusting, noxious, evil villains that i've ever met, he is also, oddly, an object of pity. not to be mistaken for sympathy. he deserves a slow, torturous, endless agonizing death. his singleminded foxhunt of jamie is confusing at first and later, every time his name is mentioned, i literally became filled with rage. i'm one of those that cried when i'm angry and i can't even tell you how hard i cried. enough that i couldn't read any more. i had to calm down first. 
 poor jamie :( 
 here is my reaction, of which i typed in the buddy read i was taking part in after i read the specific part that made me hate...literally hate randall. do not read this if you don't want a huge spoiler. you've been warned!!82% 
 son of a fucking bitch!!! not only did jamie get raped but we don't even get to see that evil, sadistic ass hole suffer? i'm so mad right now. so fucking mad. and what the hell was all the wolf bullshit? why even put that in there? it has no bearing on the story except to draw out the part where jamie is once again flogged...tortured, burned, beat, raped. so i say again...what the fuck? i'm a vindictive bitch. i want payback. that fucker needs to suffer. jamie needs to look him in the eye while he guts him. how fucking anticlimactic to give him an easy out. i am just livid. i'm so pissed off i'm crying 
 yeah, suffice it to say that i really hope we get more of randall and that ms. gabaldon feels the black rage that i felt toward him. i hope, i hope, i hope. even rereading my reaction makes my blood pressure rise. 
 final thoughts: 
 yes, this is a great historical fiction novel but jamie and claire..their love, their devotion to each other is what makes this story epic. you just can't get around that fact. this is a love story. and so much more. i was so conflicted from the position that both claire and jaime were put in. what is right and wrong here? claire loves her husband. but here she is, in this impossible situation, of which she can confide in no one. not a single person. and so she goes first with her gut. then with her head, and finally, finally with her heart. 
 ""does it ever stop, claire? the wanting?"" 
 ""you're mine, mo duinne,"" he said softly, pressing himself into my depths. ""mine alone, now and forever. mine, whether ye will it or no."" i pulled against his grip, and sucked in my breath with a faint ""ah"" as he pressed even deeper. 
 ""aye, i mean to use ye hard, my sassenach,"" he whispered. ""i want to own you, to possess you, body and soul."" i struggled slightly and he pressed me down, hammering me, a solid, inexorable pounding that reached my womb with each stroke. ""i mean to make ye call me 'master,"" sassenach."" his soft voice was a threat of revenge for the agonies of the last minutes. ""i mean to make you mine."" 
 and later... 
 ""oh, aye, sassenach...i am your master...and you're mine. seems i canna possess your soul without losing my own."" 
 with the gorgeous backdrop of scotland, the descriptions alone, and the way the dialogue forces you to sink into the setting is worth the entire read. 
 i'm beyond happy that i finally started this series. i'm trying to pace myself while reading the next stories, as i feel the greatness in ma bones. this book itself was so amazing, i can't imagine what's in store for me. there were a few hints...very, very tiny hints in this book of some strange happenings with regards to the time travel aspect. things always get convoluted when it comes to the whole switching time thing. what came first, claire in real time or claire in 1743? what will she change by going back and messing around with her ancestors, or more so her husband's ancestors? i can't wait to find out. i put off reading this book for the library book club. here are my three reasons for doing so: 
 1) it's a young adult book. i am an adult. it can't be that good if it's written for young people. 
 2) it's about the holocaust, and i think we've all heard enough about that. the author will probably even focus on colors among the grays, as in ""schindler's list."" 
 3) i have way too many other books to read. 
 after avoiding the book for as long as possible, i sat down, hoping to enjoy it enough to gain some clever comments for the book group. 
 turns out, most of my concerns were right. but one other thing was also true: this book rocks. 
 the first thing any review will say about this book is that it is narrated by death. so, i might as well get it out of the way. death, the hooded one, the angel of the night, narrates. he is very busy during the war years, as you might expect. some people claim this is a mere gimmick, and that the story is strong enough as it is. 
 i agree that this is a strong story-- it moves like a sailboat on a brisk day-- but i think the choice to tell it through death was a good one. death foreshadows constantly, so we know a bit about which of the characters will die. instead of ruining the shock value, this heightened my anticipation and dread. and isn't that how people feel during war? they know some of them are bound to die. they know they will lose loved ones. it's one long, hellish wait to see how it will turn out. 
 it's also an unusual take on the holocaust because it focuses on liesel, an orphaned german girl living in hitler's birthplace. liesel (the book thief) and the other characters in this book are rich, interesting, and wily. i say wily because at points in the book you hate them, but they change, and you grow to love them. for instance, liesel's adopted mother is a foul-mouthed, abusive, sharp woman. (spoiler--->) when liesel's adopted father is shipped off to war, however, liesel creeps through the house to see rosa sleeping with her husband's accordian strapped around her waist. rosa's changes prove one of the greatest reasons to read good literature-- to get insight into the type of people we don't usually give a second chance. i could bang mr. rochester like a screen door 'till next tuesday. that's not all i got from this book, honestly... whatttt how did i not mark this magnificent creation of a novel as read before??? 
 i read this book 2 years ago and it has captured my heart and is my favorite book of all time <3 i'm sure this is going to mark me as a literary dud, but for all the brilliant reviews of this book? i couldn't really get into it. 
 the book revolves around marie-laure, a blind girl who lives with her father. her father is the locksmith at the paris museum of natural history, and marie is raised wholly in the museum and at home. marie has a semi-idyllic childhood until the nazi's invade paris and she and her father have to flee to another city, where a reclusive uncle lives. unknown to marie, her father is smuggling the world's most priceless jewel out of the city on behalf of the museum. unfortunately for them, a german soldier is hot on the trail of the jewel, and will go to extreme lengths to find it. 
 werner is a german orphan who teaches himself everything to do with radios; after repairing a senior-ranking german officer's radio, he is given entry into a youth academy that trains young soldiers for hitler's army. he is then drafted to utilize his skills to find resistance armies who are using the radio - but werner is no soldier and soon realizes the cost of his talent. 
 i found the book somewhat plodding; like you were waiting for something important to happen...and waiting, and waiting, and waiting. eventually marie and werner's stories collide - but only briefly and completely unsatisfactorily. i'm sure that's the point - that life is hardly satisfactory, but still. parts of the book were very interesting - the last third probably kept my attention best. this wasn't a book that you can't put down though; very little tension (at least for me). yes! i read this. i admit it! you caught me! not only that... i loved it. it is a double sin i will likely have to one day repent for by reading piles of dostoyevsky while i tear out my hair. in any case. right, once again into the breach to defend myself! 
 this book is incredibly long. it's just a fact. all of them are. but they go by so incredibly fast. by the time i got to the third one? i read it in three days. the pages just keep turning. i read at double speed i was so engrossed in the story. and i must admit that usually i hate time travel romances (... i mean.. not that i have any experience trying them before... never...) but this one is not even about that. or if it is, it just makes it better. 
 also? there is a pile of historical information in this text. it deals with the bonnie prince charlie uprising, and the rest of the books go on to deal with the american colonies and the revolution by the time that they're done. it's not just about the romance. it's about medical treatment, what horrid things scottish people ate, the reality of what people would have suffered through. which is in some cases i think a direct indictment of the scottish highlander bodice-rippers in which everyone is shining and perfect and with awfully clean white teeth. i'd say this is more historical fiction than romance. 
 but fine, let's deal with the romance. yes. there is a lot of sex. however, i found it to also be deeply intimate and true, brutal, and real. claire and jamie, while apart, are deeply attractive and sympathetic characters with a good deal of nobilty about them. throw them together in love? and they are beautifully frail, selfish, angry, flawed. i love that statement. i really find them so incredibly touching. 
 so there. it's not just a romance novel. i stick my tongue out oh so maturely at the readers of this review. i always thought, or imagined, that there were these invisible lines trembling in our wake, outlining our trajectories through life, throbbing with electric energy. lines that sometimes cross one other, or follow in parallel ellipses without ever touching, or meet up for one brief moment and then part. a universe of lines crisscrossing in the void. 
 anthony doerr's astonishing new novel ""all the light we cannot see"" follows the complex arcs of two such invisible lines through the lives of werner pfennig, an orphan boy in pre-world war ii germany and marie-laure leblanc, a blind girl living in paris with her father. through riveting flash forwards and flash backs, the novel charters the course of their lives as they struggle to find out wether it is possible to really own your life when it is swallowed by the black holes of history. one is driven by a deep love of science while the other is inhabited by the power of books. in the midst of the rise of german fascism and the birth of the french resistance, how does youth manage to stay true to its essence? 
 a war story, a coming-of-age story, a philosophical fable, this is a novel that constantly oscillates between the moral uncertainties of life and the chiselled precision of the natural world that surrounds us. between the political morass of war and the stupendous beauty of organisms, the ocean, the human brain. 
 the language is so fantastically precise - anthony doerr does things with verbs that make entire paragraphs sing - that the visual component of this book is quite astounding. 
 in the end, what this novel illuminates is the miraculous impact that seminal events have on the rest of our lives, whether it be the magic of radio broadcasts on the mysteries of science or the extraordinary adventures of jules verne's ""twenty thousand leagues under the sea"". 
 a deeply moving and enthralling work that echoes the power of early impressions on the building of a self, such as the philosopher simon critchley recently evoked so beautifully in a stunning essay published in the new york times entitled ""the dangers of certainty"":

 masterful. a couple months ago, a little bird on the internet let me know that felicia day was writing a memoir. 
 and honestly? i didn't know how to feel about that. 
 don't get me wrong, i was happy for her. i love books, and it makes me happy when one of my friends is writing one. it makes me even happier when one of their books is getting published. it's like they're getting to have a baby but with only a fraction of the nausea and weight gain. 
 what's more, i'm a fan of felicia's. she's done a lot of work that i really enjoy. not just acting (dr. horrible is still close to my heart after all these years) but the work she's done as a writer and producer has really impressed me. 
 but at the same time, i was scared. because... well... i love books. and i can be a very critical person. and when i'm revising my own work, trying to read a book for pleasure can be like feeding it into an angry woodchipper because my critical faculties are already engaged. 
 when someone i like comes out with a book, i'm always nervous. what will i say if i don't like it? 
 it's not that i was worried about the quality of her writing. far from it. i enjoyed the hell out of the guild, and that was the pure child of her brain. but there's a big difference between writing a screen play and writing a novel. things people say on a screen and words you read on the page aren't the same. and there's a big difference between a writing a season of episodes and a book-length manuscript. 
 even so, i went out of my way to get an advance reading copy of the book. it's one of the few genuine powers i possess as an author, and i abuse it at every opportunity. 
 then, with some trepidation, i started reading. 
 within just a couple pages i felt myself relax. the writing was good. better than that, actually. it turns out felicia's delightful turn of phrase translated really well to the printed page. it actually made me laugh out loud in places. in fact, i think i might have laughed out loud more reading this book than any book i've read in years. 
 it helps that the book is absolutely written in felicia's own voice, and that voice is delightful: charming and earnest. what's more, she's led a strange life and isn't bashful talking about it with disarming honesty. 
 but of all the things i liked in this book (and i liked a lot of them) my favorite thing was the fact that felicia doesn't shy away from discussing the dysfunctional parts of herself. she talks about them plainly, and goes into detail about how they've screwed up her life from time to time. 
 sometimes this these stories are funny, whimsical, bizarre. but there were a few chapters that stunned me. chapters where i thought, ""wow, you feel that way too? i didn't know..."" 
 and that, perhaps, is the best thing a book can do for us sometimes. it can help us feel like we are less alone. 
 so, is this book worth your time? yes. very yes. 
 i'd recommend it to pretty much anyone, whether or not you know or care who felicia day is. in fact, i plan on picking up some copies as gifts, and i'm going to give them away the same way i did jenny lawson's last book. 
 my one regret is that i didn't get my act together quickly enough to give felicia a promotional blurb. but judging by the other folks who are already there (george r.r. martin, jenny lawson, ernie cline, john scalzi, cory doctorow...) it doesn't look like she was hurting for endorsements. 
 hell. looking online, i see that the finished version actually has an foreword by joss whedon. i'm going to have to buy a new copy just so i can read *that.* 
 so yeah. give it a try. seriously. the doorbell rang the other day and when i answered it, there was a very slick guy in a nice suit standing there and a limousine parked at the curb. he started shaking my hand and wormed his way into the house. 
 ""mr. kemper, i'm john doe with dee-bag industries incorporated. i need you to sign some paperwork and take a ride with me. don't worry, i'll have you home in a day or two,"" he said. then he pulled a document out of his briefcase, set it on the coffee table and pushed a pen in my hand. 
 ""wait a second. what the hell is this all about?"" i said as i tried to pick up the paper to read it, but doe kept trying to force my hand with the pen down on it so i couldn't see what it said. 
 ""oh, that's just legal mumbo-jumbo. you'd rather try and read your mortgage agreement than this old thing. just put your name down and let's be on our way, shall we?"" he said. 
 there was a brief scuffle, but i managed to distract him by messing up his carefully gelled hair. as he shrieked and ran around looking for a mirror, i finally got to read the document. 
 ""this is a medical consent form. what's going on?"" i demanded as i shook the paper at him. once he had combed and smoothed his hair back into perfection, doe sighed. 
 ""very well, mr. kemper. i guess i'll have to come clean. do you remember when you had your appendix out when you were in grade school?"" 
 ""sure. that gave me one of my better scars, but that was like 30 years ago. why are you here now?"" i asked. 
 ""you're probably not aware of this, but your appendix was used in a research project by dbii,"" doe said. 
 ""really? i assumed it just got incinerated or used in the hospital cafeteria's meatloaf special. why would anyone want to study my rotten appendix?"" 
 ""oh, all kinds of research is done on tissue gathered during medical procedures. most people don't know that, but it's very common,"" doe said. 
 ""ok, but why are you here now?"" 
 ""well, your appendix turned out to be very special. it was secreting some kind of pus that no one had seen before. after many tests, it turned out to be a new chemical compound with commercial applications. so a patent was filed based on that compound and turned into a consumer product,"" doe admitted. 
 ""that sounds disgusting. what was it used in? because i want to make sure to never buy it,"" i said. 
 ""it's the basis for the adhesive on post-it notes,"" doe said. 
 ""are you freaking kidding me? post-it notes are based on my old appendix?"" 
 ""i'm absolutely serious, mr. kemper. now we at dbii need your help. unfortunately for us, you haven't had anything removed lately. so i have to get your consent if we're going to do further studies,"" doe said. 
 ""but you already got my goo-seeping appendix. i don't have another one,"" i said. 
 ""true, but sales have been down for post-it notes lately. so after the marketing and research boys talked it over for a while, they thought we should bring you in for a full body scan. maybe you've got a spleen giving out or something else that we could pull out and see if we could use it,"" doe said. 
 ""this is pretty damn disturbing,"" i said. 
 ""why? you're an organ donor, right? same thing,"" doe said. 
 ""i don't consider someone lucking into an organ if the chiefs win a play-off game and i have a goddamn heart attack the same thing as companies making money off tissue i had removed decades ago and didn't know anything about,"" i said. 
 ""fortunately, the american government and legal system disagree. so how about it, mr. kemper? will you come with me?"" doe asked. 
 ""i dunno. what's my end of this? you already owe me a fat check for the post-its."" 
 ""oh, no. you won't get any money from the post-its, or if any future discoveries from your tissues lead to more gains."" doe said. 
 ""that's complete bullshit!"" 
 ""again, the legal system disagrees with you. but this is for science, mr. kemper. you don't want to hold up medical scientific research that could save lives, do you?"" 
 ""it's for post-it notes!"" 
 ""maybe, but who is to say that the cure for some terrible disease isn't lurking somewhere in your genes? could you live with yourself if you prevented crucial medical research just because you were ticked off that you didn't get any money for your appendix? remember that it's not like you could have not had your appendix removed. at least, not if you wanted to keep living. and i highly doubt that you would have had the resources to have it studied and discovered the adhesive for yourself even if you would have taken it home with you in a jar after it was removed. we're the ones who spent all that money to get some good out of a piece of disgusting gunk that tried to kill you. so shouldn't we be compensated? what are you? some kind of damn dirty hippie liberal socialist?"" doe said in disgust 
 ""you're a hell of a corporate lackey, doe,"" i said. 
 ""thank you."" 
 ""fine. i'll do it,"" i said as i signed the form. ""but i want some free post-it notes."" 
 ""no deal. steal them from work like everyone else,"" doe said. 
 ****** 
 obviously, i'm a big fat liar and none of this happened, but i really did have my appendix out as a kid. plus, my tonsils got yanked and i've had my fair share of blood taken over the years. what this book taught me is that it's highly likely that some of my scraps are sitting in frozen jars in labs somewhere. yours, too. if any of us have anything unique in our tissues that may be valuable for medical research, it's possible that they'd be worth a fortune, but we'd never see a dime of it. 
 henrietta lacks couldn't be considered lucky by any stretch of the imagination. a black woman who grew up poor on a tobacco farm, she married her cousin and moved to the baltimore area. her husband apparently liked to step out on her and henrietta ended up with stds, and one of her children was born mentally handicapped and had to be institutionalized. 
 in 1951, henrietta was diagnosed with cervical cancer by doctors at johns hopkins. during her biopsy, cell samples were taken and given to a researcher who had been working on the problem of trying to grow human cells. henrietta's cancer spread wildly, and she was dead within a year. but her cells turned out to be an incredible discovery because they continued growing at a very fast rate. 
 the doctor at johns hopkins started sharing his find for no compensation, and this coincided with a large need for cell samples due to testing of the polio vaccine. the hela cells would be crucial for confirming that the vaccine worked and soon companies were created to grow and ship them to researchers around the world. since then, henrietta's cells have been sent into outer space and subjected to nuclear tests and cited in over 60,000 medical research papers 
 unfortunately, no one ever asked henrietta's permission and her family knew nothing about the important role her cells played in medicine for decades. poor and with little formal education, henrietta's children were confused by what was actually done to their mother and upset when they learned that her tissue was part of a multi-million dollar industry that they've received no compensation from.. 
 rebecca skloot has written a fascinating book that clearly outlines why henrietta's cells were so important, why she went unrecognized for decades, the pain it's caused her family, and the way that new medical discoveries over the last sixty years have opened a potential pandora's box of legal and ethical issues regarding tissue collection, research, patents and money. this book brings up a lot of issues that we're probably all going to be dealing with in the future. 
 also posted at kemper's book blog. warning: f-bomb laden and spoiler ridden rant ahead. reader discretion is advised. 
 jesus fucking rollerblading christ. 
 no. fuck no. i can't do it anymore. you wanna read a historical love story with imperfect main characters? go read karleen koen's dark angels. 
 you wanna read a story about how fucked up stalin and the soviet union were pre, during and post wwii? go read the gulag archipelago 1918-1956. 
 you wanna read an in-depth history of the european campaigns of wwii? go read the guns at last light: the war in western europe, 1944-1945. 
 you wanna read a book about two of the most self-centered assholes in the history of literature? read this book. 
 we meet our female lead, tatiana, the day the nazi's invade russia. her family freaks the fuck out, like everyone else in the country does, and they immediately spring into action, sending their only son to ""safety"", other family members to get money out of the banks and their idiot youngest daughter, tatiana, to go get food to stockpile. does she understand the severity of the situation? no. she fucking reads for a little while after everyone leaves because she never gets alone time. 
 okay, so that might be understandable because the girl is sixteen and has no idea what the reality of war is like (<- this is what i told myself to keep from getting pissed). then when she finally does go to get food she starts to notice that there are lines everywhere and places are sold out of the things she barely remembers that they need. 
 imagine fucking that. 
 of course she starts to frantically run around the city in fucking high heels and a pretty dress because it was sunday and she wanted to look nice. how dafuq you gonna carry that much food in ill-fitting heels, tania? you think about that? no, no you fucking didn't. you were too preoccupied with looking pretty, you vapid little nitwit. 
 so, running around, running around. ""i have to catch this bus to get to the next grocery store in time but oh, is that ice cream?"" no. no you are not going to stop and eat fucking ice cream right now (<-this is my disbelief talking). but oh yes, yes she fucking is. because she is a self-centered asshole. 
 it's while sitting on a bench and eating her ice cream, her beautiful long blonde hair flowing around her in the summer breeze, that she meets the second most self-centered asshole in the history of literature, alexander belov. guess what? he's hot. he also saves her day by letting her into the officer's section of the grocery store so she can buy supplies to her heart's content. then he and a buddy carry them all home for her because she can't because she's in fucking heels and has blisters. 
 imagine fucking that. 
 and so begins the basis of their entire relationship. it can be summed up in one quote: 
 ""she needs me so much to take care of her... and i desperately need to take care of her."" 
 that's it. that's the entirety of this ""love"" story. it's nothing but tatiana being a fucking tstl little mary sue and alex playing the fucking white knight to her damsel in distress. 
 i know what you're thinking. 
 welp, sorry to break the news but 
 so alex and dimi, his rat of a friend, help tania bring the supplies home and lo and behold what do we discover? that the handsome soldier our female lead has been lusting after is actually dating her sister. 
 meet dasha, the only decent person in the first two hundred pages of this book (that's as far as i got). because dasha is a good person she gets completely fucked over. wanna know how??? her boyfriend and sister proceed to fall in love behind her back. 
 does alex realize what's happening and do the right thing by breaking up with her? hell no, he's a self-centered asshole, remember? he's also a fucking sadist because he parades his relationship with dasha in front of tatiana, who he secretly sees every fucking day. 
 does tatiana tell her sister what's going on? hell no, she's a self-centered asshole, remember? she's also a fucking masochist because she continues to see alex even with him dating her sister and acting like a monumental douche. 
 so that's it. self-centered asshole sadist with a hero complex meets self-centered asshole masochist with princess syndrome. they fall in love and their theme song is fuck everyone else. they'll probably dance to it at the wedding, wide smiles on their asshole faces as they fucking tango across the graves of those they sacrificed on the altar of their love. 
 this review can also be found at the alliterates. hillbilly elegy by j.d. vance is a 2016 harper publication. 
 when i first noticed this book popping up on goodreads, i admit the title really threw me. i hate that word 'hillbilly' because it sounds derisive and conjures up stereotypes. but, then, i noticed the reviews were stellar for the most part, and so i took a closer look. 
 once i finished reading this book, i was stunned. i actually shed tears, and nearly talked myself out of leaving a comment at all. but, my husband convinced me to at least say my peace, even if i lost every friend i had on goodreads. when one makes a stand, they must be prepared for the consequences- but i hope i still have all my friends after this rant is done. but, hubby is right. this needs to get said, so here goes. 
 first of all, let me say, that vance is a prime example of what i have taught my children to believe. i have often spoken out about those who make excuses for why they ended up living a life of crime, or wound up stuck in a vicious economic cycle. vance made some solid decisions and was able to move away from a bleak and depressed area and the rather colorful upbringing he had, managed to find a way to garner, not just a solid education, but an ivy league education, and is now working at a white collar job, living the american dream. he is obviously very proud of his achievements, and i am proud for him. but, i do think his ivy league status has gone to his head just a little bit. 
 what rubbed me the wrong way about this book, is mr. vance's tone. he puts down anyone who works a blue collar job as though that is the worst thing that could ever befall someone. he is arrogant, patronizing and superior in his assessment of his family and those who reside in the appalachians, but doesn't stop there, insinuating anyone who works blue collar jobs should be earnestly seeking a way out of that embarrassing predicament. 
 now, i do not live in that area, i have never even visited the area. but, i do know all about depressed locations, with schools that suffer from low funding, where parents do not necessarily stress formal education to their children, where factory work is always available, and is the staple of and the sole source of income for the community. i understand, and agree with mr. vance's concerns for these areas and the sparse opportunities these folks have, the attitudes they convey, and their defensiveness at times. 
 but, on the other hand.... 
 my husband and i are both blue collar workers. i worked in supermarket management until i retired. my husband worked on a dairy farm, then went on to work for two local factories. he has done this type of work his entire life, but he makes a good living, has a decent health care package, and something many people coming out of universities do not: a strong work ethic, principles, and integrity. 
 so, i felt vance's remarks on blue collar employment were unfair. i know many people who work right alongside my husband who have college educations. they do not sit at a desk, where a suit, carry a briefcase, or make more money that we do. they have a job, and are happy and thankful to have it. 
 but, not everyone is college material, and not everyone wants to sit in a cubicle behind a desk all day. my husband would be miserable in such a position. he enjoys working with his hands, is creative, artistic, and can put even the most tech savvy people to shame with his computer skills. 
 but to suggest a person who could not get loans for college or grants or scholarships, who settled into a long term position doing blue collar work should be embarrassed by the life they live, and should be ashamed of themselves for not getting up off their sorry, no good, lazy asses to do better for themselves or their families, is an arrogant presumption and groups together a whole lot of people, and stereotypes them, unfairly, and i felt like i had been personally slapped by the author, as he looks down his nose at blue collar work, with an air of superiority, deciding on our behalf what path our lives should take, and what is best for us, the environment we should we live in, the types of jobs we should hold, and what will make us the happiest. 
 i have all my teeth,( no mountain dew mouth here), i never beat my kids, or screamed obscenities at them, caused a scene in public, had numerous 'men' in my life, packed a pistol, dipped tobacco, or neglected my children. i was never a drug addict, or alcoholic. i have never hit someone, encouraged violence, or praised it. i hate bullying of any kind and believe there are far better ways to solve problems or conflict, than resorting to violence. 
 i am an honest, law abiding, tax paying citizen the same as you. i watch the same movies, read the same books, and enjoy the same leisure activities you do. i travel, garden, am an animal rights advocate, fight for women's rights, and have feminist tendencies. i raised two decent human beings, one of which is in college, the other taking a different path, but both are productive citizens making good money, and are living positive and moral lives. 
 i live in a nice brick home, have newer model cars, a nice landscaped lawn, and live in a nice neighborhood, and insist on living inside my means, which means having to say no to things i want sometimes. my hometown is a rural, college town, with ranching and dairy work being predominant occupations as well four factories, and the college, which also provides job opportunities. many people who left here to get their educations, returned to start or raise their families. they want to live here, like living here and are as upwardly mobile as they wish to be. they could leave anytime and move to the city, but enjoy the slower pace of life, the sense of community, the value systems we adhere to, and a clean, safe environment for their children. 
 i know wealthy, highly educated people who suffer from drug addiction, problems with alcohol, are abusive, physically and verbally, who neglect their kids, have epic entitled hissy fits, yelling and screaming in public when they didn't get their way, and instill a sense of entitlement on their children, who give little or nothing back to their communities, and believe it not, support the republican candidate!! they have numerous affairs, cheat, lie, steal, and blend families with the best of them,many of the exact same actions, qualities and traits mr. vance was so embarrassed by from his own family. 
 i did not miss the moral of vance's story, but i did find his deliverance less than impressive, and the timing of this release is not lost on me. is this a political statement, a plea for those in rural areas not to buy into trump's rhetoric? i mean, after all, those of us working blue collar jobs, without the benefit of a formal education must be easily misled by all of the republican candidate's promises, lies, and claims, right? i'm not sure, if the author was trying to make a statement on that concern, but others seem to believe he was, and for the record, we do not support the republican candidate, not that this is anyone's business, but because this author seems to have figured out which way i lean based on my economic, educational and professional background, i thought i'd mention it. 
 but, here is my question. after everything has been said and done, what solution or resolution is vance offering for the plight of those living in the depressed areas of the appalachians? you can't call attention to a blight, but offer no alternatives, or suggestions on how to change things for the better. 
 so, there you go. i hope you won't think less of me now because my family lives in a small rural town, and has worked blue collar jobs all our lives and have little or no formal education, or think of me as some ignorant backwoods person, who is too stupid to see past all the political rhetoric, or is morally bankrupt, or a pistol toting grandma with a wad of chewing tobacco in my mouth full of rotting teeth. i'm not depressed, or unhappy, nor do i wish to be pitied. i try to learn something new all the time, i strive to better myself, to stay up to date and informed, try new things, but i must do this by teaching myself, and there is nothing wrong with that, in my opinion. 
 i fully expect to be chastised for my response to this book, will probably lose the respect of some, or many, maybe all of you, but i felt like i had to stand up for those who are not white collar workers after vance made it clear he holds such positions in contempt and with disdain, and believes those of us who are employed in these positions are shameful, an embarrassment, a blight on this country, and should strive for a different life, one just like his, one he can endorse. 
 i don't like being placed in a category or box this way, and don't appreciate the suggestion that because i have little formal education, or am not working in a white collar occupation, that automatically makes me poor ignorant white trash, someone in need of guidance, a republican, and a conservative, or a trump supporter. to assume such is, for all intents and purposes, classist and profiling, and that is the thing that turned me off about this book. 
 on a more positive note, i loved his grandmother!! go mamaw! i thought she was a pistol- if you will pardon the pun, and she obviously loved her grandson, which is something from his past the author should be proud of. 
 2 stars it was the comparisons to all the light we cannot see that attracted me to the nightingale. though both novels are set during ww2 the similarities for me stopped there. all the light is a magical novel electric with beautiful resounding prose and refined artistry; the nightingale is a novel motored essentially by cliche and exaggeration. 
 cliched writing isn't just resorting continually to stock phrases (though hannah does this a lot); it's also straining for tension through exaggeration to the point where dramatic tension degenerates into melodrama. no surprise that cliched phrases often perform a task of exaggeration. - ""she was scared to death."" ""she couldn't believe her eyes."" 
 the nightingale reads like ya fantasy fiction. everything is wildly exaggerated so that ww2 is perceived as a kind of post nuclear holocaust world where this one event utterly eclipses the world we live in. the perspective of the novel is one of hindsight as if all the characters are experiencing not the daily hardships of the war but the totality of all ww2's horrors. it's like her research consisted of jotting down every single horror story and deprivation and shoe-horning them all into her story. it's mostly set in a small town in the middle of france yet this small town is ""swarming"" with german soldiers, gestapo, ss, jews, bomb damage as if the entire war is centred there (i was only surprised hitler and eva braun didn't have a holiday home there as well). the two main characters are loaded with the ordeals & accomplishments of an entire circuit of resistance members. isabelle is every soe heroine rolled into one and vianne is a kind of female schindler. 
 plausibility is often sacrificed to ""thrills and spills"". in the space of three pages a jewish woman is told the nazis will arrive at her house the next morning. three paragraphs later - or two hours later - she has magically acquired false identity papers. three paragraphs later she is about to cross through a peaceful checkpoint when inexplicably the german guard begins machine gunning everyone as if he got bored just checking papers. he even takes the trouble to shoot the woman's nine year old child in the back. this is all passed off without explanation as if it were a normal wartime incident. 
 the big surprise though is that the ending is genuinely moving and really well managed. hence all the gushing reviews. basically to enjoy this you need to anaesthetize your critical faculties. that done i guess there's enjoyment to be had because hannah is a decent storyteller and is good at developing human relationships. no doubt it'll soon be a hollywood film. so. freaking. excited. for. this. book. this is the first book i've really enjoyed reading after my horrid book slump and i loved it! i need more of kerri's writing in my life, especially with her amazing characters like bloody jack ;) what if you had the chance to live your life again and again, until you finally got it right? 
 ursula todd is born in a snowstorm in england in 1910 but dies before she can take her first breath. during that same snowstorm she was born again and lives to tell the tale; again and again. life after life tells the story of ursula's lives, as with each new life she makes small changes that send her on a completely different path. 
 i feel like i'm the only person on the planet that thought this book was overhyped and over rated. sure kate atkinson has this trippy ability to create this bleak world while still managing to add some wit and compassion but it wasn't the writing that was at fault. the premise of the book makes it sound really good but let's face it; it is just groundhog day in disguise. the book is clever, but it tries too hard to be clever and it didn't really turn out the way it should have; for me anyway. this book is getting so many rave reviews, i feel like i am a black sheep just telling people it did not work. 
 as i said before, there is nothing wrong with the writing; kate atkinson has created this lyrical narrative and i did find myself being swept away in the words. i even felt like at times i was reading this book without thinking about what was happening; a few times i had to stop and process before continuing. i almost found myself not noticing a death and ursula's life starting again and that could have got me completely lost. i did feel like kate atkinson did however overdo the twists and it turned out to be a roundabout way to retell the same story over and over again with different outcomes. this could have worked; and it sounds like it worked for many people but i sadly wasn't one of them. 
 i wonder if kate atkinson was trying something different and experimental where she could play with the character's death and life, explore the concept of life's choices and their consequences but because there were no real penalty to ursula's life i wonder if it really worked? do you ever have deja vu? (i don't think so, but i could check with the kitchen) life after life just seems to repeat the same scenes, some readers might gain a sense of familiarity and for me it just felt like i wasn't getting anywhere. 
 life after life is the kind of book you should probably read in a real cold climate; the snowy, dark and sometimes bleakness of the novel seems to call for it. maybe read snuggled up on a dark winters night and don't forget your booties 'cause it's cooooold out there today (it's coooold out there every day. what is this, miami beach?). it is just the book that would work better in the cold; though it is never cold here in townsville, maybe that's why it didn't work for me. 
 i really wanted to enjoy this book; i will try another kate atkinson novel because i really think she has a great style. just so happened life after life was not for me and i know people loved this book and will probably complain about this review but at least it was just an excuse to put some groundhog day quotes into something. this book has had so many positive reviews so maybe it is just me, if the book sounds like something you'd like then don't let this review stop you, is it too early for flapjacks?

 (i read the rest of the book over the course of the evening and since i am not pro-spoiler i will not continue with the emotional roller coaster except to say that there was one.) 
 (also, read this book. it is truly, truly special.) 
 ps - watch for a maximum shelf issue from shelf awareness on this title ;) such a thrilling read! the main characters were all so interesting and i loved how much mystery and tension there was in each of their stories. i also loved the rich world building! i'm not usually big on history, but i loved the way the history was presented here. between the setting and the writing, everything was so vivid, which just amped up the intensity. 
 overall, this was a fantastic historical standalone. i definitely recommend it, especially if you like emotionally gripping reads with lots of tension and fascinating characters! beautiful. i read this book as an advance galley, long before it became a thing and i did not read this book because i wanted vance to explain trump, though he's somehow been chosen by liberal media as the person to do just that (though the handful of interviews i saw seemed more like chris matthews wanted to pat himself on the back for having a guest with hillbilly cred than actually listening to what vance had to say). i didn't think this book would have mass appeal because no one outside of appalachia seems to give a shit about appalachia, and its success has surprised me. it's not a perfect book, but i do think it's a good starting point as long as you remember that this is just one guy's perspective on his own experiences. 
 i picked this up because vance is from the same part of the world as me and i wanted to read about something that i could relate to. that cover photo looks like it could have been taken on the road that i grew up on, in one of the poorest places in ohio where appalachia and the midwest intersect. it was so poor that a girl who made me cry in first grade was featured on a cbs news story on american poverty. 
 i always knew it was different from the cities and suburbia reflected in pop culture, but moving away and realizing just how different it is from other places was still a weird experience for me. it's so rural that i struggle to describe it adequately to the people i've met since living in philadelphia and the dc metro area. it matches stereotypes to some extent, but the stereotypes also often miss the mark. people not from appalachia really don't get it, and they're often way too quick to dismiss it. i never really fit in in appalachia, for so many different reasons, but i'll also fiercely defend it. put me in a room of east-coast natives making jokes about ""uneducated rednecks"" and i will probably grow a second head. poor rural white people are the last group that you can make fun of without being considered un-pc, and i think that's a huge problem that creates a lot of divisiveness. books like this one show a culture that is underrepresented. 
 vance grew up in a small town between cincinnati and dayton. (tbh, i never really thought of that as appalachian because cincinnati is on the opposite side of the state from me, but vance's family moved north from kentucky so of course it is.) his family experienced many of the same migration patterns, cultural touchstones, and poverty-related struggles that describe the lives of my extended family and the families of my high-school peers. his father was never a consistent presence in his life, his mother struggled with drug addiction. his grandparents were the greatest source of normalcy in his life, but they taught him to live by a hillbilly code of loyalty and self-sufficiency. though they encouraged him to take his education seriously, wanted a better life for him than they'd had, he didn't do well in school and didn't seems to think he'd ever have a future outside of appalachia. 
 but then he joined the marines and it turned his life around. with a new sense of self-determination, a broader perspective of the larger world, and developed leadership skills, vance enrolled at ohio state university and, eventually, went on to yale law school--an unheard of achievement for someone from his family, his hometown, and his struggling public high school. a lot of the experiences he had in new haven frustrated him, and that was definitely something i could relate to. however, i think those experiences caused vance to dig into his conservative values in a way that i can not relate to. 
 there's been some sociocultural analysis of appalachia, but i don't think anything's ever focused so specifically on appalachia ohio. that's something that i definitely appreciated as a native. i'm also unaware of any exploration of the region that's actually been done by a native and therefore possesses an insider understanding of what makes the people tick. there really are a lot of very specific personality traits that are unique to the scots-irish people who settled in the ohio river valley, and these traits make no sense to outsiders. when people talk about how ridiculous it is that west virginia tends to vote republican even though it seems to be against their interests, they are fundamentally misunderstanding a lot of these traits that are so ingrained in the psychology of the state and that frustrates me to no end. 
 vance focuses primarily on his own personal story. he does cite some research about the region in general--but this is mostly for context and is not meant to be exhaustive. i think it's important to remember that vance is conservative, though he doesn't seem to be as far right-wing as the tea party, so his ideas may not appeal to the point of view of many liberals coming to this book trying to make sense of trump. by giving this book four stars, that's not to say i necessarily agree with his political point of view but i think it's important to hear different voices. 
 vance makes an attempt to extrapolate from his own experience to explain why ""simple"" social welfare is not enough to help address the problems of appalachia. the short answer is: there are no easy solutions, because so many of the problems are circular. people don't succeed because they don't see anything to be hopeful about, and they don't see any room for hope because so few have succeeded. without hope, no one bothers to take baby steps towards the kind of changes that can move the region into a better economic reality. i think some people see that as blaming the poor for being poor--which is a thing that happens and is a gross oversimplification--but i do think there are both internal and external factors at play here. 
 i do wish i'd come away from this book feeling a little more optimistic, that it offered up some more concrete solutions, but i suppose that wasn't really vance's stated purpose. and it's not really something that falls squarely on his shoulders. he's still young--just 31, he likely only finished yale two years before this book was written, if i've done the math correctly. perhaps ""concrete"" is something that he can bring with some more time? or maybe he's just not the guy that's going to be bring ""concrete."" regardless, i do think it's important to listen to the voices of appalachia. change is never going to happen until we all start listening to each other and not just applying our own prejudices to each other's words. i was cleaning up after the wife and i had dinner last night and there was a small amount of green beans left. there weren't nearly enough for another serving to make them worth saving so i dumped them in the sink, but just as i was about to turn on the garbage disposal, i realized that to the pows described in unbroken those few green beans i was about to mulch would have been a feast they would have risked torture and beatings for. i was disgusted with myself for the rest of the night. you know the book you're reading is hitting you hard when you feel that much shame for letting a tiny bit of food go to waste. 
 louie zamperini is one of those guys who definitely earned that greatest generation label. the son of italian immigrant parents, louie was a rebellious kid who was constantly into one form of mischief or another, but when he finally channeled his energy into running, he became a high school track star in california. louie was so good that he made the 1936 olympics in berlin at the age of 19, and even though he didn't medal, he ran one lap of a race so quickly that he electrified the crowd and even caught hitler's attention. 
 as a college runner, louie held several national records and many thought that he'd be the man to eventually break the four minute mile. he was poised to do well in the 1940 olympics, but then world war ii cancelled the games. louie left college and ended up in the air corps even though he was scared of planes. he became a bombardier and went to the pacific after pearl harbor. louie survived several missions, including one where their b-24 barely made it back with over 500 holes in it. 
 while on a search and rescue mission, louie's plane crashed in the ocean, and only he and two others survived. with few supplies on two tiny life rafts, they'd endure exposure, starvation, thirst and sharks. 
 however, after finally reaching an island and being captured by the japanese, louie's hellish experience as a pow would make him miss the raft and the sharks. starved, beaten, tortured and degraded, louie also faces extra punishment at the hands of a brutally sadistic guard who singled him out. louie and the other prisoners desperately try to hang on long enough for america to win the war and free them. 
 i didn't care anything about race horses, but found laura hillenbrand's seabiscuit an incredibly interesting read. she's surpassed that book here with this well researched story. hillenbrand creates vivid descriptions of louie's childhood, the berlin olympics, the life of an air man in the pacific, and a japanese pow camp while also telling the stories of the people around louie. 
 she also does a superior job of describing a phase of world war ii that tends to get overlooked, japanese war crimes against prisoners. the number of prisoners killed by the japanese through starvation, beatings and forced labor are staggering, but hillenbrand also shines a light on the japanese policy of killing all pows if that area was about to be invaded. per her research, they were preparing to begin slaughtering prisoners in japan in late august and september of 1945, but the dropping of the atomic bombs and the surrender of the emperor probably saved those pows lives. if the war would have carried on or a conventional invasion done, then mostly likely those prisoners would have been killed.* 
 *(do not take this as my personal feelings about whether nuclear weapons should have been used or not. i'm just relaying a part of the book here, and hillenbrand makes no argument as to whether dropping the bombs was justified. she writes that many of the pows believed that the bombings probably saved their lives and leaves it at that. and if you feel like trying to start a comment fight about it, i'm just going to delete it so don't bother. i left my sword and shield at home today and don't feel like battling trolls.) 
 ultimately, while this is a book about people enduring incredible hardship and cruelty during war, it's a hopeful book, not a depressing one. great writing and the care that hillenbrand took with the people and places make this compelling reading. i wrote it so i think it's pretty good. 4.25 
 so much fun! why the fuck is the average rating for this book like 4.3 when i spent 75% of the book wanting to bash the stuffings out of the main love interest with a rusty one-pointed morning star? 
 but ugh. since everyone loves it, allow me to present my version of it. 
 if the duke demands - khanh's version 
 *main characters* 
 trent: duke, main love interest. stodgy and with a stick in his ass bigger than the washington monument 
 miranda: an orphan who runs an orphanage, in case the author hasn't made her life tragic enough yet. she also does things like rewrites shakespeare so that hamlet contains pirates. 19th century manic pixie dream girl 
 robert and quinn: trent's siblings and major fuckbois 
 lady jane: trent's aspired future duchess. she is very chill. perfection. like a polar pop. 
 lady diana: robert's love interest. her hair is the color of afternoon light on a field of wheat 
 act---oh, who the fuck are we kidding. let's just get on with it 
 *ahem* 
 miranda: oh my god oh my god. tonight's my chance to totally bone robert, the man i've loved my entire life. and how better to do it than to sneak into his room and seduce him? he'll totally see me as a woman then. what could possibly go wrong. 
 trent: *sighs mournfully* i am so burdened by the ducal office. it sucks. all this responsibility. and i feel such guilt, you know? because i practically killed my dad and all. and by killed my dad i mean i wasn't there to say goodbye to him after he was injured in a tragic accident that nobody could have foreseen. and to make it worse, i killed my dad/failed to say goodbye to him because i was in bed with an actress! to compensate for my failure, i will be totally perfect and marry only a respectable woman and not do shady shit like meet a chick for a tryst in her room at all. 
 miranda: **as lady rose** well, hellooooooooooo! 
 trent: damn, bitch! gimme some of that pussy! 
 *bow chicka bow wow* 
 trent and miranda: oh fuck what the fuck are you doing here? 
 trent: i've known you since you were 12. what the fuck?! who could have foreseen that at age like 19 or something that you'd be a woman and have a woman's body?! what the hell?! who could have foreseen this? 
 miranda: oh fuck oh fuck oh fuck i should have thought this through. ok, we'll both forget about this, ok? 
 trent: yeah, i mean totally. i need to find a real duchess, and totally not you, cause i know my dead dad won't approve. so how about we help each other? i'll halfheartedly help you win my brother robert, who is courting the lovely diana, whose hair is the color of starlight upon a blade of grass in midsummer. 
 miranda: deal! in return, i'll help you find the perfect duchess despite the fact that i'm a simple country girl who has no idea who the fuck is in the aristocracy and no idea how the fuck to conduct myself in the ton 
 act whatever 
 miranda: oh my god we're in town. i'm gonna flitter about being an unpredictable little lady and everyone will love me because i'm just so fucking special and delightful! 
 trent: god she's hot. how did i not realize she was so hot? but whatever, i'm here to court the lovely and cool-headed lady jane 
 lady jane: ta. 
 robert: oh my god it's lady diana, she of hair the color of spun golden candy floss upon a stick of diamonds 
 miranda: my heart, it is broken. but damn, trent is so cute. how did i not notice how cute he is? 
 trent: oh god i know i'm supposed to be helping you get my brother but hhhhhhhhnnnnnnnnnng damn girl you're hot. let me put my hands under that skirt in front of all these people at a play! let's hope nobody sees us and you won't get ruined cause i sure as hell ain't marrying you lol 
 miranda: oh, no! trent! i can't! why not, instead of doing it in front of a theatre audience, you try to finger me inside a moving carriage first. 
 trent: deal! and remember i'm not marrying you. i want lady jane. right lady jane? 
 lady jane: ta, trent. 
 trent: god. lady jane is so perfect, so lovely, so composed. but if only she responds to my caresses the same way that little improper sprite does. let me kiss lady jane and be sure. 
 **one very proper kiss later** 
 lady jane: ta 
 trent: fuck, she didn't even make me hard. 
 act who the hell cares 
 miranda: oh my god all his wandering fingers have got me feeling tingly. i know i'm not a proper duchess for him but i want to give myself to him. take me, trent! 
 trent: you know i ain't gonna marry you, bitch. but yeah, gimme that pussy. 
 *the next night* 
 miranda: oh my god i'm so stupid. how could i possibly have done that? given my virtue to someone who will never marry me and who has ruined me? whatever, let's do it again! 
 trent: yeah! get over here, gurl! you know i'm still not gonna marry you, right? 
 **the next night** 
 miranda: what have i done? i've fallen in love with him out of nowhere. the only way to cure this is by fucking him again, cause surely he'll see that i'm right for him by proving that i have self-control and that i have the miens of a duchess. 
 trent: i'm not gonna marry you, but i will have sex with you again! 
 miranda: ok. that's all i want *_* 
 **the next morning** 
 robert and quinn: oh fuuuuuuuuuuuuck trent. you're fucking miranda!!!!! yeah! yeah! you go bruh! wait, what were you thinking? 
 trent: be quiet motherfuckers. if you reveal this to anyone i'll fucking cut your balls and your allowance off. i'm just fucking her. i don't love her and will never marry her. 
 miranda: **accidentally overhears** what? *burst into tears* this is brand new information 
 trent: ....but i've been telling you this 
 miranda: *wails and runs away* 
 trent: .... 
 ugh, i'm tired. whatever, they had a happy ever after. ugh, this book. really loved this book and it's story because i personally have never heard about this side of the war before and i'm so grateful i know about it now. 4.5 stars! really liked this one! it was fun and hilarious and romantic and i didn't want it to end! monty's voice had me completely hooked from the beginning--i enjoyed his character so much, and i loved how he grew over the course of the book. i did feel that some aspects of the plot were a bit shaky, but if you can suspend your disbelief a little and just go with it, it is such a fun ride and i would definitely recommend it! 4.5, really enjoyed it several years ago, i worked at an art gallery here in anchorage. though i loved the art, i wasn't much good at selling it. more often than not, i just chatted up the customers, who were from all over the world. 
 one night, four elderly people wandered in. they told me they were from a tiny island off the coast of southern england called ""guernsey"". i'd never heard of it, so they proudly explained it was the only part of british soil that had been occupied by the nazis during world war ii. the island was occupied for a long five years; an experience to which they had all been witnesses. at that moment, guernsey was marked in my mind. 
 mary ann shaffer and annie barrow's new book, ""the guernsey literary and potato peel pie society"" is an opportunity to travel back in time to 1946 guernsey. 
 beginning early 1946 in london, juliet ashton, a british writer, and former war journalist, is emerging from the ashes of the war to rebuild her life and her identity. she has lost her home and all her possessions, most regrettably her book collection. out of the blue, she responds to correspondence started by a resident of guernsey, who has managed to obtain a second-hand book once owned by juliet, in which she had long ago written her name and address. through this initial contact, juliet meets an entire community, and the course of her life is redirected. 
 easily reminiscent of helene hanff's epistolary classic, ""84 charing cross road"", the novel is written in the epistolary style. shaffer and barrow skillfully use this medium to successfully establish their characters and a solid storyline. 
 charming, funny, sweet, and thoughtful, ""the guernsey literary and potato peel pie society"" is a story that women might find more appealing than men. yet, it is unflinching in its wartime recollections. the deprivations and devastation of the time are imaginatively and convincingly conveyed. 
 at its core, this is a book about the love of reading, and the magic of books. 
 i highly, highly recommend ""the guernsey literary and potato peel pie society"". excellent writing, strong concept. i am personally burnt out on slavery narratives so i cannot say this was a pleasure to read. so much unrelenting horror. whitehead does an excellent job of portraying slavery and america as a slave nation. the idea of the underground railroad, as an actual railroad, is so smart and interesting. i wish he had actually done more with the railroad itself. there were some sentences where i thought, ""now you are just showing off."" the amount of research the author did is clear, throughout. there is some really interesting structural work at play. i wanted some of the secondary characters to be more fully developed. this book is going to do very well, and rightly so. dear reader, 
 many thanks for your interest in z. you might appreciate knowing a little bit more about what went into the creation of the novel, and why i chose to write fiction about people whose lives are so thoroughly documented in biographies. 
 z is fiction, but my research was extensive and thorough, and in telling the story i've stayed very close to the established facts. my personal approach to biographical fiction is to unearth and then represent the truth, even when it contradicts what people think they know about the characters involved. much of what we think we know about the fitzgeralds comes from unreliable sources or has been spun into half-true myth. my mission was to set the record straight. 
 popular culture (midnight in paris, for one example) has made zelda into a caricature, reduced her to being only an edgy flapper, or only an unstable, jealous spouse, or only a pathetic, ""insane"" drain of her husband's creativity and life. she was edgy--sometimes. she was jealous--sometimes. she was unstable--sometimes. but in the same way that none of us can be or should be defined by one aspect of our lives, zelda cannot be defined so simply either. 
 z is the story of a complex and fascinating woman who was so much more than i knew when i began researching her life. she was exceptional in so many ways, but she was also human. 
 best wishes, 
 therese anne fowler date i finished this book: 06/09/2013 
 date i was ready to review this book: never 
 unfortunately, i have to review it because it is due back to the library tomorrow, so here comes my completely insufficient review. 
 this book is by khaled hosseini. 
 really, what more is there to say? i knew it would be wonderful. 
 i have to admit that the problem i ran into was that i was comparing it to his previous two books too often. and let's face it, they were amazing. and this book is incredible in its own right, too, but it's not to be compared. so, i tried to view this as its own book (which it most certainly is) and forget i had ever read the other two and that this was the first time i was experiencing hosseini. 
 i'm not going to recap. it would be pretty difficult to not give anything away. there are many stories within this one story. the characters are intertwined, although many will never realize that they are. the story comes full circle, but this is mr. khaled hosseini, so i didn't expect a full blown happy ending. and *spoiler alert*, i didn't really get one. 
 none of this business going on: 
 although, i will say that maybe disney and hosseini are of one mind. or at least sebastian and hosseini: 
 yes it is, sebastian. yes it is. 
 what have i learned from this book? 
 we (the human race) have (mostly) good intentions. but we (mostly) do not follow through. we soothe ourselves. we convince ourselves. we justify our actions. or our lack of actions. we have an ""out of sight, out of mind"" way of thinking. it's a human flaw. and sometimes it has consequences that we cannot comprehend. consequences that we may never realize because, hey, it's out of sight. oh sure. just like him to point out what is wrong with me! not that i'm taking it personally... 
 one thing anyone who has read my other reviews should know is that i frequently complain about: 
 1. not making me care about the characters enough 
 2. not being able to envision the surroundings - the people, the buildings, the culture, etc. 
 i don't experience this problem with this book. the writing is so rich that i felt like i was there. my emotions reflected the emotions of the characters. i was invested. 
 i am not ashamed to admit that i went back to chewing on my nails while reading this - a habit i gave up over a decade ago. 
 something bad is going to happen!!! 
 you would think this was an edge-of-the-seat suspense novel. it's not. but it is heartbreaking. i bet i cried no less than ten times. granted, i cried when they showed a bear on the local news that they rescued from a telephone pole, so i cry more than the average bear (ha. ha. ha.). but it was still really heartbreaking...over and over and over because there were so many intertwined stories. 
 i really enjoyed this book. i didn't love it in the same way i loved the previous two, but i loved it still. and i will give you a parting paragraph that is an example of the beautiful writing that makes me savor every word of this book: 
 now and then, when she turned to tap ash into a saucer, i stole a quick glance at the red polish on her toenails, at the gold-tinged sheen of her shaved calves, the high arch of her foot, and always at her full, perfectly shaped breasts. there were men walking this earth, i marveled, who had touched those breasts and kissed them as they had made love to her. what was left to do in life once you had done that? where did a man go next once he'd stood at the world's summit? 
 -------------------------- 
 i just finished this. i am emotionally drained. review coming soon. 
 -------------------------- 
 04/18/2013 
 did...did i just read that there is a giveaway for this? shut the front door! 
 too much? 
 ok, i'll settle for cute and hope for the best. ;) 
 -------------------------- 
 what?! a new book by khaled hosseini? i can't...i just can't....i can't even think straight right now becauseohmygoodnessiamsososososososoexciiiiiiiiiited!!!!!!!! 
 i can't wait!! 
 have i mentioned how excited i am!? 
 i am so excited! i am going to start with review with a disclaimer. this review is subjective, from my point of view etc. i thought this book was terrible, bad, no good. you don't have to agree with me, and you could think that this was the most amazing book and your eyes almost exploded from all the awesomeness that traveled through them to reach your brain which leapt in your skull with every sentence you read, and that is fine. i do not think that you are inferior to me. 
 now on to my review. stop here for spoilers (although you might regret it! it's an awesome review.) 
 i am not one to judge books by their covers, although a good cover is always a bonus, and this book has a excellent one. props to the graphic designer. combined with being on the new york times best seller list, and having an first rate premise, i thought this one was a winner. but i was wrong. dead wrong (ok that is a little dramatic.) if i was describe my reading experience like the ocean tides, sometimes i would be fine, floating near the shore, but other times it would sweep me out to sea with its ridiculousness. the conclusion didn't help the novel's case. it left a distinctly bitter taste in my mouth. 
 so basically the premise is that a couple, tom and isabel, living on a island in a lighthouse in australia, find a dead man and baby ashore. isabel, filled with grief from her last three miscarriages, begs her husband to kidnap the baby and bury the dead man in a ditch so she can be fulfilled as a woman and finally have a child. she assumes that the mother is dead, so i mean, is she really doing anything wrong? it's like when you find a stray dog and it has a collar. what if the dog was being abused, so that's why it ran away? it's your duty to keep that cute dog and love it forever. except.... this is a baby. now i have never had a miscarriage, nor have i ever had children, so i guess this is why i hated isabel so much. i don't understand her point of view at all. i agreed with tom, and was pretty mad when his sympathies got the better of him. i mean really, it's a baby people. it is a human life you're messing with! 
 so tom and isabel visit the main land like every three years, and this time they bring the baby, who they have named lucy, for her christening and to show off to everyone. now here comes the twist: the mother is alive! shocker i know. so tom once again is like, ""hey, this is kidnapping now, and the mother is literally insane with grief. maybe we should give back her baby."" and isabel is all like, ""no! i can't have babies. and i am a selfish person who is pretending to be a good person by saying it is better for the baby if she stays with us. we can't confuse lucy!"" for me, i have always thought love was doing what is best for the person you care for. apparently, this is not what isabel thinks love is, so this makes her the villain of the story in my perspective. 
 so of course, tom and isabel are found out eventually, all by tom's doing, so he takes the blame for everything. this is the point where i want to give up on the book, and it's not because i hate isabel for letting tom take the blame to make him suffer for taking lucy away. the story is full of pointless dialog and characters (and not even jane austin style with enjoyable pointless dialog.) it is like stedman's publisher was like, ""this novel has to be 300+ pages so, get on that and write me some more!"" i think i would have enjoyed this story much more if it was a short story. i skimmed the last chapters, just so i could be done with it. 
 now there are some redeeming factors to this novel ( i mean it's not like this is 50 shades of gray terrible, i gave it two stars) . stedman is a great writer when it comes down to descriptions of the island of janus and little antidotes about the 1920's in australia. i just didn't like her characters, not one of them. 
 so my conclusion is read this book for yourself and make up your own opinion. as for me, i still need to learn that ""judging a book by its cover"" is a phrase for a reason. 
 ***edit*** 
 so i just found out that they are making this book into a movie. because hollywood. 
 http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2547584/?ref_=nv_sr_1 i would like 409 pages of my life back. 
 (watch my full review:) 
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssib8... idk sounds kinda dumb. earlier this year, i was one of the lucky people jenny sent an advance reading copy of her newest book to. 
 the simple upshot? i loved it. i loved it even more than her first book, which i enjoyed so much that i bought multiple copies to give away as christmas presents. 
 the bad news is that my life is such a bloody shambles that i didn't get back to her in time for a gushy blurb to make it onto the back of her book. (not that she particularly needed one from me. she's got gaiman, allie brosh, and all manner of other fancy folk singing her praises.) 
 still, i loved the book. and when i love a book this much, i want to talk about it. i want to encourage people to read the book so that your lives will be dramatically embettered. 
 i finished reading the book on an airplane, and i was so happy and weepy and amazed that i sent jenny the following series of text messages: 
 ""jenny, after a long delay, i've finally finished your book while flying. while it's still fresh in my mind, here are some potential blurbs for your book."" 
 ""this book made me laugh in a restaurant, it made me cry on an airplane. it made me feel like maybe i'm not a total human trainwreck. it made me resolve to spend more time being furiously happy."" 
 ""i wish jenny lawson was my neighbor."" 
 ""this book is a good book and you should buy this book and read this book.""

 w'qr `l~ nfs~ b'n~ ln 'krr mthl tlk lkhtyy'@ _ lnhyz ltbqt~ _ thny@an why write a review if i am such an atypical reader? 
 i will keep this brief since i feel most readers will not react as i have, but isn't it important that all views are voiced? 
 all readers must agree that the flipping back and forth between different time periods makes this book more confusing. i believe it must be said loudly and clearly that the current fascination with multiple threads and time shifts is only acceptable when they add something to the story, when employment of such improves the story. in this book they do not improve the story. perhaps jumping from one scene to another can increase suspense, but must one also flip back and forth in time? in addition, more and more books are made for audios, and this is not helpful when you cannot flip back to see where you are. finally, time switches unnecessarily lengthen the novel. 
 secondly, be aware when you choose this book that the book is not only about ww2 but also a diamond that some of the characters, quite a few in fact, believe has magical powers. those who possess the stone will not die, but people around that person will come to misfortune. this is all stated in one of the very first chapters; it is not a spoiler. this aspect of the book turns the story into a mystery novel. where is the gem? who has it? the result is that you have a heavy dose of fantasy woven into a book of historical fiction. i have trouble with both fantasy and mystery novels. maybe you love them. (i would have preferred that the diamond was woven into the story as one of the objects stolen by the nazis.) 
 let's look at how the book portrays ww2. it is set primarily in brittany, france, and germany and a little bit in russia and vienna. its primary focus is about what warfare does to people, not the leaders, but normal people. i liked that you saw into the heads and felt the emotions of both germans and french. some of the germans are evil but you also come to understand how living in those times shaped you. to stand up against the nazi regime was almost impossible. there are some who try. these events are gripping. you also get the feel of life in brittany versus paris. they are not the same. i enjoyed the feel of the air, the wind in my face and the salty tang on my lips in st. malo. i do wonder to what extent my appreciation of brittany as a place is more due to my own time there or the author's writing. am i remembering my own experiences, or am i seeing it from the words of the author? i am unsure about this. 
 in any case, i was very disturbed by the blend of fantasy with gripping ww2 events. 
 the events of ww2 are those portrayed in every book. if you have read about ww2 in numerous other books of fiction or non-fiction you will not get much new. rape by russians felt like the author had to include this simply so it could be to be togged off his checklist. i do think the book moves the reader on an emotional level. you get terribly angry and shocked, and this is achieved through the author's writing, his excellent prose. 
 and this is what saves the book - its prose. the descriptions of things and places, the particular grip of a hand, movement of a body and what characters say. very good writing. beautiful writing. sometimes you laugh, sometimes you feel that wind on your skin or the touch of a shell against your fingertips or smile at the oh so recognizable words of a child. children often see far more than adults, but they also talk in a clear, simple manner. what they say is to the point - could that diamond be thrown away? of course not. as remarked by one of the french children, ""who is going to chuck into the seine a stone worth several eiffel towers?"" even if the gem has dangerous powers! 
 people love reading about kids and one of them here is blind. who wouldn't be moved by such! 
 the narration by zach appelman didn't add much, but neither did it terribly detract from the story. i appreciated how he read some lines with a beat, a rhythm which matched the cadence of the author's words. pauses were well placed. french pronunciation was lacking. 
 oh my, once i got going i told you what i felt. i believe this book will be popular, and many will like it, but it was just ok for me. there is little that freaks me out more than the holocaust. and i'm not belittling it at all with the phrase 'freaks me out.' growing up in the 1970s and 80s, i felt sufficiently desensitized enough by television violence to be able to gauge how often i need to shake the jiffy pop and run to the bathroom before the program/violence resumes. 
 elie wiesel's night brings me back to my senses, makes me hate the cold hearted bitch i've learned to be. and not by some overtly dramatic rendition of the horrors of life in a concentration camp but more of the lack of it. the down to the nitty gritty telling of what happened during the year that he was imprisoned. it wasn't going for the kick to the gut reaction, more of a confused, inconceivable retelling of day to day events, and this---this--- is what really makes me shudder and be at a loss for words. hell, words? who am i kidding? try coherent thought. i have this terrible, dreary feeling in my diaphragm area this morning, and i'm not positive what it's about, but i blame some of it on this book, which i am not going to finish. i have a friend who is mad at me right now for liking stupid stuff, but the thing is that i do like stupid stuff sometimes, and i think it would be really boring to only like smart things. what i don't like is when smart (or even middle-brained) writers take an important topic and make it petty through guessing about what they don't know. i can list you any number of these writers who would be fine if they weren't reaching into topics about which they have no personal experience (incidentally, all writers i'm pretty sure my angry friend loves. for example, the lovely bones, the kite runner, water for elephants, memoirs of a geisha, etc.). these are the books for which i have no patience, topics that maybe someone with more imagination or self-awareness could have written about compassionately, without exploiting the victimization of the characters. they're books that hide lazy writing behind a topic you can't criticize. the help is one of these. 
 you've got this narrative telephone game in this book. the telephone game is pretty fun sometimes, and it is really beautiful in monster stories like frankenstein and wuthering heights because what they are telling me is not intended as trustworthy or earnest. all of the seriousness in monster stories is an impression or an emotion reflected back through the layers of narrative. i don't feel that way about the topic of the help, though. in this book, a white woman writes from the point of view of a black woman during the civil rights movement, who overhears the conversations of white women. it's an important topic, and i don't want to hear it through untrustworthy narrators. 
 so, i can basically get on board with the dialect of the black maids, but what throws me off as a reader is when the black maid is quoting the white women and they're all speaking perfect english without a trace of an accent. it becomes particularly weird when one of the black maids starts to comment on the extreme accent of one of the white women, celia foote, whose written dialogue continues to be impeccable. who is this narrator? why does she choose not to speak proper english if she can speak it? why does she choose to give proper english to someone else who she has told me doesn't speak it? also, usually the layers of narration in a telephone-game book are only within the book. in this case, it's the author's voice stabbing through the story. i am convinced it is her whose brain hears the white woman speaking tv english, and the black women speaking in dialect. it gives away the game. 
 even the quotes from the movie have an example of this. a conversation between her and minnie goes like this: 
 celia foote: they don't like me because of what they think i did. 
 minny jackson: they don't like you 'cause they think you white trash. 
 celia speaks in a proper sentence, but minny misses the ""are"" in the second part of the sentence. celia says ""because,"" but minny says ""'cause."" if the reader were supposed to understand that celia does not speak in dialect, that would make sense, but since it specifically states that she does, it doesn't make sense. 
 to attempt to be clear, i didn't have a problem that the book was in dialect. i had a problem that the book said, ""this white woman speaks in an extreme dialect,"" and then wrote the woman's dialog not in dialect. aerin points out in message 111 that i am talking about eye dialect, which is about spelling, not pronunciation, as in the example above. everyone, in real life, speaks in some form of non-standard english. though i have seen some really beautiful uses of eye dialect, as aerin points out, writers typically use it to show subservience of characters or that they are uneducated, which often has racist overtones. if it troubles you that i'm saying this, and you would like to comment on this thread, you may want to read other comments because it is likely someone has already said what you are going to say. 
 i'm not finishing this one, and it's not because i think people shouldn't like it, but rather because i'm almost 100 pages in and i can see the end, and it's failed to engage me. when a few irl friends have asked what i thought of the book and i said i didn't care for it, they have told me that i am taking it too seriously, that it is just a silly, fluff book, not a serious study of civil rights. again, i don't have a problem with stupid books, but when it's a stupid book disguised as an important work of cultural history, all i want to do the whole time is tear its mask off. and a book about civil rights is always important cultural history to me. anyway, the book becomes unpleasant; i become unpleasant; it's bad news. if you loved this book, though, (or, really, even if you hated it) i would recommend coming of age in mississippi. i think that book is one of the more important records of american history. plus, it's beautifully written, inspirational, and shocking. it's been years since i read it, so i might be giving it an undeserved halo, but i can't say enough good things about it.

 ""stockett did experience the civil rights era"": comment 154; comment 343. 
 ""the author of the lovely bones was raped"": comment 190. 
 ""the author of the kite runner is from afghanistan"": comment 560. 
 ""memoirs of a geisha is accurate and not comparable to the help"": comment 574. 
 ""don't be so critical!"": comment 475. 
 ""have you written a bestseller?"": comment 515. 
 ""fiction doesn't have to be a history lesson"": comments 157 through 162. 
 ""having grown up in the south during this era and having had a maid, i could relate to the emotional nuances of this book"": comments 222 and 223. 
 ""minny and aibileen are relatable"": comment 626 
 ""you are trying to silence authors"": comment 317 and comments 306 through 316. 
 ""why do you want to read a civil rights book about racism and hatred? i would prefer one about friendship and working together"": comment 464. 
 ""why are there so many votes for such a half-assed review?"": comment 534. 
 ""authors can write outside of their personal experiences"": comments 569 through 587. this book, even though at times difficult to read due to the subject matter of the holocaust (and it continuing), was an exceptional read! highly recommend, truly unique!! it's pride and prejudice for socialists. mara wilson is a delightful storyteller. i felt like she wrote this book just for me, and i cried a lot while i was reading it. 
 but you don't need to be an adrift adult who was a famous kid (like me) to fall in love with her stories and the people in them. mara is almost 20 years younger than me, but the stories she told about growing up weird, sensitive, and filled with anxiety could have come from my own childhood -- and that doesn't even take into account the whole famous child actor thing. 
 i literally just finished where am i now?, and i have a lot of feelings that i need to process. i suspect i'll be processing them for awhile, because that's what a good book, written by a talented author, will do to a person. fyh frq kbyr m byn n tqr' ktb wykwn kwys y`tyk sh`wr jyd w hssys jyd@ yjby@

 ynsh bh bshd@ the light between oceans is an incredibly moving novel about what happens when good people make bad decisions. the story takes place in the town of point partageuse, australia during the 1920s. the story begins when a light house keeper and his wife find a life boat containing a live baby (and dead man) on the shore of their isolated island. through a mixture of misplaced intentions and unsupported superstition they decide to raise the child as their own -- deciding not to inform the authorities of the child's existence. 
 although the book was a quick read, i never once felt that it was forced or lacking in anyway. the plot is compact -- never wavering from its central theme. i enjoy this kind of focused writing. irrelevant or distracting side plots would have pulled me away from tom and isabel's narrative and weakened my investment in their turmoil. 
 the story is highly emotional. stedman crafts a perfectly gray scenario that forces its readers to question their own moral standing. this truly is reader manipulation at its most powerful. allowing the reader to sympathize with morally ambiguous characters is a difficult task, however, stedman presents her narrative in such a way that the reader can't help feeling the same inner conflict as tom and isabel. 
 considering this is stedman's first published novel, i am incredibly excited to see what she produces next. this was a masterpiece in storytelling. my love for jenny lawson is not at all creepy 
 jenny lawson, i wanna make you blts and braid your hair. i am really shitty at braiding, and my fingers will be covered in mayonnaise after making you all those blts, so it will probably get a little messy and crazy, but it's the thought that counts!! and since your book is basically a manifesto of owning one's messy and crazy bits and alchemizing* them into comedy gold, we should be all set. 
 this book is a little more personal that let's pretend this never happened: a mostly true memoir; a little more serious. that's not to say i didn't bust out into indelicate snort-guffaws many times while reading this, because i totally did, but in between all the laughter there's a lot of brave and honest stuff about managing mental and physical illness through anecdotes that are not at all humorous. 
 and none of that is a criticism - i think it's astonishing how well she is able to write about her own obstacles; how clear-eyed she is in describing the debilitating emotional symptoms of disorders impossible for people who aren't fellow-sufferers to understand, while offering a platitude-free example to those who are that yeah, you can live through this shit. 
 she'd probably hate it that i'm calling her brave, but she is. it's not easy to share this much of yourself and unleash it into the world to complete strangers. and while i'm not on any medication, nor am i seeing a therapist, i still recognize a lot of myself in her stories. and maybe i'm not brave enough to elaborate on that, or maybe i'm just not comfortable suggesting that my problems are in any way comparable to hers, but i know a lot of people who will see themselves in this book, and that it will help them and make them laugh in equal parts. and i'm sure doctors would disagree with the adage that laughter is the best medicine, but it's not the worst. the worst is that antidepressant they advertise on teevee with the disclaimer about its side effects including depression and thoughts of suicide, because how is that helpful? 
 so while it feels strange to say about a book so full of voodoo vaginas, dead raccoon rodeos, and japanese toilets - this is an important book. it just also happens to be really fucking funny. 
 her late-night musings 
 if you put a bunch of chameleons on top of a bunch of chameleons on top of a bowl of skittles what would happen? is that science? because if so, i finally get why people want to do science. 
 the wisdom she learned from her father 
 you don't have to go to some special private school to be an artist. just look at the intricate beauty of cobwebs. spiders make them with their butts. 
 her assessment of australia 
 people warned us that everything in australia wants to kill you, but i think they're overreacting. australia doesn't want to kill you. it's more like an exclusive club for people who care very little about being alive. australia is really a lot like texas if texas were mad at you and drunk and maybe had a knife. 
 and her scoffing at bruce springsteen, dismissing him as ""obviously not the boss of scientific accuracy."" 
 i mean, he's probably never even conducted any chameleon/skittles experiments. 
 but it's her tales about how unfit she is for the adult world that were the most dangerous to my tendency to laugh-pee, particularly the chapter that involves her meeting with maury the financial planner and victor - aka mister jenny lawson. 
 maury asked me if i had life insurance and i assured him that i didn't because i didn't want victor to be arrested. there was a pause in the conversation. 
 ""she thinks life insurance is only taken out on people about to be murdered,"" victor explained stoically. 
 poor victor. 
 victor sighed, but frankly i'm not really sure what he'd expected. it was my job to accidentally make money and his job to make sure that i didn't lose it when i was doing wobbly cartwheels in the parking lot after the bars closed. our roles had been clearly defined. 
 poor victor. 
 ""we can come back to wills later. how about retirement plans?"" 
 victor spent the next several minutes speaking in a combination of words and letters that i'm pretty sure means ""i have a retirement plan and it's quite good."" 
 maury looked at me expectantly. 
 ""i have a drawer i put change into."" 
 victor put his head in his hands. 
 ""not quarters though. i use those for gum."" 
 poor victor. 
 all of this seems entirely sensible to me. and familiar. i don't like dealing with forms and grown-up things, either. and i like gum and cartwheels. 
 poor victor also has to deal with her clutter of dead animals, her plans for a living cat/tax write-off called ""the president,"" and her delightfully irrepressible spirit as the book's cover-model, rory the raccoon, sneaks up over victor's shoulder during business-related skype calls. 
 lucky victor. 
 i want a rory photobombing me, too. 
 oh! dreams do come true! 
 i just fucking love her - the parts where i can nod along: her boredom with financial matters, her fear not of flying but of getting to the plane, her anxiety over small talk and hiding when the doorbell rings, her love of cheese despite being lactose intolerant, and also the parts where i may not be able to relate, but i want to bake her a pie and try to make things better for her. 
 although it seems as though she is finding her strength all on her own 
 you learn to appreciate the fact that what drives you is very different from what you're told should make you happy. you learn that it's okay to prefer your personal idea of heaven (live-tweeting zombie movies from under a blanket of kittens) rather than someone else's idea that fame/fortune/parties are the pinnacle we should all reach for. and there's something surprisingly freeing about that. 
 it is an amazing gift to be able to recognize that the things that make you the happiest are so much easier to grasp than you thought. there is such freedom in being able to celebrate and appreciate the unique moments that recharge you and give you peace and joy. sure, some people want red carpets and paparazzi. turns out i just want banana popsicles dipped in malibu rum. it doesn't mean i'm a failure at appreciating the good things in life. it means i'm successful in recognizing what the good things in life are for me. 
 but this is a jenny lawson book, and i'm not going to close a review with something sedate and rational like that. should i quote a portion from her one-night-stand with a sleep clinic? or from the story containing the frantic exclamation i've swallowed a leprechaun and it's eating its way out of my chest? or her realization that everything in the world either is or isn't pandas? 
 no, i will quote a passage from the appendix, which in the jennyverse is located in the middle of the book. 
 i realize that it's weird that this appendix is in the middle of the book instead of at the end where appendixes are supposed to be, but it works better here, and technically your appendix is in the middle of your body so it sort of makes sense. probably god had the same issue when adam was like, ""i don't want to sound ungrateful, but it sort of hurts when i walk. is that normal? is this thing on my foot a tumor?"" and god was like, ""it's not a tumor. that's your appendix. appendixes go at the end. read a book, dude."" then adam was all, ""really? because i don't want to second-guess you but it seems like a design flaw. also that snake in the garden told me it doesn't even do anything."" and god shook his head and muttered, ""jesus, that fucking snake is like tmz."" and then adam was like, ""who's jesus?"" and god said, ""no one yet. it's just an idea i'm throwing around."" and then god zapped adam's appendix off his foot and stuck it in adam's midsection instead in case he decided to use it later. but the next day adam probably asked for a girlfriend and god was like, ""it's gonna cost you a rib,"" and adam was all, ""don't i need those? can't you just make her out of my appendix?"" and the snake popped out and hissed, ""seriously, why are you so attached to this appendix idea? don't those things occasionally explode for no reason whatsoever?"" and god was like, ""this is none of your business, jefferson. i'm starting to question why i even made you."" and adam was like, ""wait... what? they explode?"" and god was all, ""i'm not negotiating with you, adam."" and that's why appendixes go in the middle and should probably be removed. 
 when i die, i am leaving my body to jenny lawson, and she can stuff it and do whatever she wants with it. hopefully it will involve wings. 
 maggie gets into it. 
 sort of 
 * j-law's not the only one who can make up words! i wanted to savour this one, word for word. towles bestows on us a language to be treasured; a story to be remembered. 
 this was a remarkably enchanting narrative with a charming character. a gentleman, rostov, has been put under hotel arrest. for the next several years, as he serves his time, relationships are cultivated from employees to guests to the visitors he receives and to a young girl whom he becomes a guardian for. 
 very descriptive - i tasted almost every meal he ate - from the crisp and tartness of an apple; to the bitterness of his coffee. this is a man who truly separated himself from others in appreciating the simple things in life. a man who was duly present, authentic and honourable. 
 this is a story that should be read with a good bottle of brandy or simply with the purist adoration for a storyteller who can transcend time and magically entrance us. bravo, towles. bravo. i bequeath a 5 star. warning: this review will be lengthy due to pure hatred. 
 did i ever tell you that i've got a time machine? there was a freak accident where my laptop and my lawn mower got fused together following a lightning strike, and now i can use it to travel in time. it's a long story. anyhow, when i have a chance, i take the occasional trip through history. recently, i popped into london in 1940 during the blitz to take a look around. it's a fascinating time with england hanging on by its fingernails during nightly bombings and waiting for a german invasion that seemed certain. 
 i was getting ready to return to 2010, and started firing up the time-mower when suddenly three people, two women and a man, ran up excitedly and started wildly shouting questions at me. 
 ""are you from the retrieval team?"" 
 ""where is your drop?"" 
 ""what took you so long?"" 
 after a few minutes they finally calmed down enough to introduce themselves. they were polly, eileen and mike. they saw me with the time-mower and figured out i was from the future. they demanded to know from when. 
 ""my name's kemper. i'm from 2010,"" i told them. 
 ""oh, no,"" polly wailed. ""you're not from oxford?"" 
 ""uh, no. i'm from kansas,"" i replied. 
 ""so you're not a historian from 2060 like us?"" mike demanded. 
 ""nope. you guys are from 2060? that's incredible, what's it like?"" i asked. 
 ""well, it used to be grand. we got assignments to go back and observe points in history by going undercover to live and work during these times,"" eileen said. 
 ""that sounds like it would be a really exciting adventure,"" i said. 
 ""no, it's awful,"" eileen said. ""you see, something terrible has happened. we each had different assignments. i was working with evacuated children in the country, mike was supposed to observe the ships returning from the rescue of the british army at dunkirk, and polly was going to work as a shop girl at one of the department stores."" 
 ""what happened?"" 
 ""well, first, my assignment was terrible. the english lady i worked for made us do all this extra war work while she wouldn't lift a finger, and i had to deal with all these children. there was this brother and sister, alf and binnie, that were always getting into mischief and causing me problems. then there was measles outbreak so i was quarantined for months with the kids so i was long overdue. when the quarantine finally lifted, my drop wasn't working. you see, the drops are the spots where we can go back to oxford in 2060,"" eileen said. 
 ""yes, and my drop isn't work either. i got a job at a department store, just as planned, but when i tried to check in, it isn't working,"" polly said. 
 ""is your drop not working?"" i asked mike. 
 ""we're not sure. see, i was supposed to arrive in dover, but there was slippage. that's when we don't arrive exactly when and where we were supposed to. so i ended up 30 miles away in this little village and three days late. a lot of stuff happened after i met commodore harold, and it was months before i got back to my drop, and now there are always people around it. they won't open if anyone from this time frame can see it,"" mike said. 
 ""who is commodore harold?"" 
 ""he was this old man at the village. i was trying to get him to take me in his boat to dover because i had already missed part of the evacuation. but he wouldn't listen to me and kept insisting that he was going to dunkirk. then i fell asleep on his boat, and he took me there. which was terrible because i probably changed history and now we'll lose the war,"" mike said. tears came out of the corners of his eyes. 
 ""we can't change history,"" polly said. 
 ""yes, we can. i did,"" mike cried. 
 ""you don't know that,"" eileen said. 
 ""yes, i do. it's all my fault,"" he said and sobbed harder. 
 ""well, if you think you had it bad, i had a terrible time getting a black skirt,"" polly said. 
 ""a black skirt?"" i asked in confusion. 
 ""yes, shop girls must wear a black skirt and everything was confused at oxford when we were leaving because of schedule changes so wardrobe could only get me a dark blue one. i got the job but the woman in charge would fire me if i didn't get a black skirt. and i kept trying to get back to the drop so i could go back to oxford and get one, but i kept getting delayed. when i finally got there, the drop wasn't working. plus, i couldn't wrap the packages properly so i had to spend ever so much time practicing it,"" polly said. her lip quivered slightly as she remembered the horror of wrapping packages. 
 ""uh, didn't they give you any money when you came to the past?"" i asked. 
 ""oh, yes. tons of it,"" polly said. 
 ""and you were working in a department store?"" i said. 
 ""yes."" 
 ""so why didn't you just buy a black skirt there instead of spending all that effort trying to time travel to go home and get one?"" i said. polly only looked at me blankly. 
 ""i had problems, too. i tried and tried to get out of the quarantine and sneak back to the drop, but mr. samuels locked the doors,"" eileen said. 
 ""who is mr. samuels? a cop or doctor?"" i asked. 
 ""no, just the old gardener at the estate,"" she said. 
 ""i had a lot of bother getting a newspaper,"" mike volunteered. 
 ""a newspaper?"" i asked. 
 ""yes, i had to spend some time in a hospital, and i wanted to see the war news to see what i had changed. but the nurses thought it was making me too upset. so i had to pretend that i wanted to do the crosswords so they'd leave me the paper,"" mike said proudly. 
 ""ok, forget about the skirt, and the quarantine and the newspaper. don't you people have some kind of back-up plan if something went wrong and you couldn't get to your drops?"" i asked. 
 ""yes, the retrieval teams!"" they shouted in unison. 
 ""i was sure that you were with the retrieval team,"" polly said. 
 ""i've spent so many hours wondering what was keeping my retrieval team,"" eileen said. 
 ""i'm sure that my retrieval team hasn't been able to locate me,"" mike said. 
 ""where, oh where, could our retrieval teams be?"" polly said. 
 ""i thought mike and polly were my retrieval team when they found me,"" eileen said. 
 ""and i thought mike was my retrieval team,"" polly said. 
 ""i know that you two are women and all that, but the next person to say 'retrieval team' is getting punched in the throat,"" i said. ""ok, so those retre.... er, people were supposed to come and get you if something went wrong, but they haven't shown. so what was your plan b?"" 
 ""plan b?"" eileen said. 
 ""yeah, for if something really went wrong and they couldn't find you or whatever? didn't you have a pre-determined spot to meet out some time later? or since all you people were running around this time, did they set up some kind of safe-house you could go to in case of emergency?"" 
 ""that's a good idea,"" polly said. 
 ""we'll have to tell mr. dunworthy that we should do that after the retrieval team... ow!... takes us back,"" mike said. 
 ""so no plan other than just sitting around fretting and speculating about what happened? since you're worried that they can't find you, have you put an ad in the paper or anything?"" i asked 
 ""oh, i checked the personals to see if the retrieval team..ow!..placed an ad trying to find us. i thought about putting an ad in so that they could find me, but haven't done it yet,"" mike said proudly. 
 ""uh.. you guys do research in the future before you go into the past, right?"" 
 ""of course."" polly said. 
 ""that would include reading newspapers?"" 
 ""yes, we get a lot of information from newspapers,"" eileen said. 
 ""and it's never occurred to any of you that if you put a message in that says something like, 'hey, oxford 2060, come pick me up at noon outside buckingham palace on oct. 1?' that they might see it and meet you there then?"" i asked. 
 ""that's another good idea,"" eileen said. ""you've got a knack for this, kemper."" 
 ""are you kidding me? you're goddamn time travelers, and you never thought of doing that? or leaving a letter with a lawyer for delivery to oxford in 2060? haven't you ever seen the back to the future movies? or that episode of quantum leap where sam and al switched places?"" i said. 
 ""well, i'm not sure that it's a matter of oxford not being able to find us. i think something went wrong and that they can't come back for some reason,"" polly said. 
 ""it's my fault!"" mike shrieked. 
 ""oh, do shut up,"" polly snapped. ""even before we left, something was going on. mr. dunworthy was changing assignments like mad, and they were having a terrible time finding drop sites. and they were very worried about us reporting any slippage."" 
 ""that's true,"" mike said. ""mr. dunworthy changed my assignment from pearl harbor to dunkirk so i had almost no time to prepare. and polly couldn't get the right clothes, and eileen had a hard time getting the driving lessons she needed."" 
 ""so this mr. dunworthy is a douche bag that sends you guys into the past with no preparation?"" i said. 
 ""oh, no! he cares about us ever so much. he sets very strict rules about where we can live and work in the past, and if there's so much of a hint of danger, he'll pull us right off an assignment. he'd send a retrieval team ...ow!...in a second if he knew we were in trouble,"" eileen said confidently. 
 i sighed and rubbed my temples for a couple of minutes. then i took a deep breath. 
 ""let me see, i've got this straight. you're all historians from 2060 at oxford who work for a guy named dunworthy who is supposedly very strict about your safety. yet, he did a last minute change of schedule with no explanation that left people going to england in 1940 unprepared and ill-equipped for the assignment. you were stupid enough to come anyhow, and you're all seemingly incapable of dealing with anything as mundane as unruly children or overbearing people. plus, the simplest task like obtaining a black skirt or a newspaper turns into a major undertaking for you. even outwitting a senile boat captain or a gardner was beyond your abilities. now something has gone wrong, and your only plan is to sit around whining about your 'retrieval teams'. is that about it?"" i said. 
 ""yes, that's about the size of it,"" mike said. 
 ""please, kemper. we really need your help,"" polly said. 
 ""well, you all may be morons, but it's your lucky day because a guy with a time-mower showed up. i guess i can't leave you here,"" i said. 
 ""that's wonderful! so you'll take a message to oxford?"" eileen said. 
 ""a message?"" i asked. 
 ""yes. we'll write a message to mr. dunworthy and you can take it to him. then he'll send a retrieval team...ow!...back for us,"" polly said. 
 they just kept grinning and smiling at me as i looked at them in disbelief. 
 ""guy with a working time machine standing right here,"" i said slowly. 
 they nodded. 
 ""and all you want me to do is to take a message to the future for you?"" 
 they nodded. 
 ""not, you know, just take you to oxford in 2060?"" 
 ""oh, no,"" mike said. ""what if we left and the retrieval team...ow!...shows up?"" 
 ""changed my mind. not doing shit for you. sit here and wait. hopefully, the germans will drop a bomb on your stupid, wussy, worthless, whining asses. see ya in hell,"" i said as i fired up the time-mower and started to fade away. 
 the last thing i heard before leaving 1940 was, ""when do you think the retrieval team will arrive?"" 
 in summary of a shitty book 
 i have never been subjected to such painful characters in my life. all three of the major players are exactly the same. almost the entire book is their inner dialogues which consist solely of fretting about stupid trivial crap, wild speculation that turns out to be completely wrong and repeatedly asking, ""oh, when will the retrieval team arrive?"" 
 you'd think that time travelers should be hardy adventurers with the ability to improvise and adapt to problems. these dumbasses can't complete the simplest of tasks without it becoming a story of epic proportions. seriously, the first chapter of this book is a guy trying to find dunworthy at oxford and having all these internal discussions with himself about where he might be, where he should look for him, what his secretary will say, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, someone please shoot me. the rest of the book consists of characters doing pretty much the same thing. 
 even worse, this is the first of two books so even after reading all this drivel, you don't get any resolution to the story. 
 when i'm on my deathbed, i'll be cursing the name of connie willis for writing this piece of shit and tricking me into wasting precious hours of my life. i wanted to like this book. i wish i could enjoy it. i bought it with such enthusiasm, and couldn't wait to start reading it. but alas, i sensed almost at the very start that it wasn't going to be a happy relationship - a point confirmed by mid-way through the book. 
 the length, the repetitive scenes, the incredible number of times ursula dies and is reborn, are all tedious and terrible torment to get through. 2/3rds in, i found myself offended for having my time wasted. surely atkinson could show the courtesy of not subjecting her readers to so many repetitive scenarios. 
 i cannot fault atkinson's writing nor do i have any particular dislike for her characters (i rather liked izzy the best). but the plot lost my interest fairly early on and by the end, i positively wanted to hurl it at a wall (i didn't. i'm rather fond of my walls). 
 my apologies for offending anyone with this review. i understand our tastes are subjective and many simply adore this book. but i'm not one of them. i expected this book to be witty. i expected it to be clever and fun. and it was. it was all of those things in spades. 
 but i didn't expect it to be sweet and sad and honest and touching. i mean, it's framed as a choose-your-own-adventure. you don't expect those to be heartfelt, emotional stories.... 
 perhaps i should start by saying that i came to know neil patrick harris in a different way than people. most of you probably know him from his two big tv shows: doogie howser or how i met your mother. 
 not so with me. i was aware of those shows, even watched them. but i came to appreciate harris by watching undercover brother. later, my admiration grew when i saw him play a deranged version of himself in harold and kumar. and last i came to love him through dr. horrible's sing-along blog. 
 oddly enough, it was the last of these that shot my respect for his craft as an actor through the roof. (and, to tangent briefly, still makes me think he would do a great job of playing bast, should my books ever make it to the screen.) 
 i mention this to let you know that i came at this book as a fan, but not as your typical sort of fan. 
 so. the book. simply said, i loved it. as i mentioned above, it was everything i expected and more. it was funny enough to make my laugh out loud more than once. and sweet enough to make me cry on an airplane twice. 
 specific things i enjoyed: 
 i liked that he spoke frankly about how he came to grips with the fact that he was gay, as well as the conflict of coming out publicly. it was extraordinary insightful. 
 there are little pieces of the book written by various celebrities harris has interacted with over the years, penn jillette, sarah silverman, etc etc. these were lovely, quirky additions to the book. 
 what's more, the choose-your-own-adventure aspect worked remarkably well. at first i thought it was just a gimmick, but i quickly learned this is a great format for an autobiography, as it gave me the chance to skip to the parts of the book i was most interested in. then, later on, i went back and read it again. 
 simply said, it was a great book. it's the only autobiography i'd be tempted to read again in the future. and it's only one i've ever considered buying multiple copies of as a christmas gifts. 
 lastly, speaking as a writer, it was irritatingly well written. it just doesn't doesn't seem fair that harris should be able to sing, dance, act, and write this well. some books give young girls dreams of ponies, kittens, and visions of eternal love. this book is not one of them. 
 if i were to make a metaphor, this book would be the equivalent of the ice bucket challenge. it offers no platitudes, it is harsh, realistic. it slaps you in the face with reality, a reality that is very rarely pleasant. 
 and it is also one of the best young adult books i have ever read. 
 i first read this book as a young teen, perhaps when i was 13 or 14. the main lesson i learned from it: life is not fair. life is hard. life is harsh. people suffer. good things do not come to those who wait. even if you're the best person in the world, life can still slap you in the face, and you can only take what fate has handed you. 
 even if you strive to be the best child you can be to your parents, they can still show favoritism to your younger sibling, for no reason than the fact that your younger sibling was determined through some undetermined reason to be superior. parents can and will play favorites, despite your best efforts. 
 even if your mother works her hands to the bone to support you and your brother, you will secretly love your wastrel, drunkard of a father more, for unfathomable reasons. because human nature doesn't always make sense, and you can't help who you love. 
 even if you're committed to common sense, you will have your heart broken. people can and will take advantage of you, no matter how much you try to guard yourself. 
 this book is a bleak one. it is about a young girl named frannie, a child born of desperately poor parents. a quiet child, a shy child, one who takes comfort in books. i think we can all relate to that. a girl mature beyond her years, due to the hardships of the poor brooklyn life in which she grew up, but a girl who is naive, all the same. 
 she knew her family was poor, but little children never notice much of that. her mother has to stretch a loaf of bread over an entire week, but there is magic in how she does it so that there is variety in their meals. she takes joy in playing with her brother, in getting a few pennies to buy a bit of candy at the dime store. in buying a pickle and reveling in the sourness of it. simple joys that only children know. it is not until later in life that reality becomes all too clear. 
 her neighbors are vibrant, colorful. above all, they are people. they are human. this may be a silly thing to note, but not all books are about people, not all books have humans that seem human. too many books have characters who are little more than typescript on a page. the people in this book seem alive, from the grumpy old man who yells at her down the street, to the sadly tragic woman who enters into a costume competition---and wins---for wearing what judges feel to be a symbolic dress with just one arm, not realizing that she is too poor to afford both sleeves, and the one arm is from a salvaged outfit. 
 if you wanted a true portrait of the people of brooklyn in the early 20th century, you will find no better depiction in this book. 
 no, this book doesn't offer any rainbows, there are no daydreams. not all little girls need constant beauty and joy and complacency. all girls, however, need a good dose of reality. they need to know that they, too, can survive and thrive, despite what life throws at them. 
 because if a girl like frannie can survive like a blade of grass sprouting from the hard concrete of brooklyn, so can they. man, this book. chills, i tell you, everywhere chills. this is a companion book to life after life, and technically, it is ""teddy's story."" teddy, you will recall from life, is ursula's little brother. if you have not read life after life - what the crap is wrong with you?? go!! read!! meet us back here when you're done! 
 i say ""technically,"" because although teddy is definitely the center of this book, we are still treated to the stories and perspectives of some of our other friends from life, as well as some new additions: sylvie, izzie, nancy, hugh, sunny, viola, bertie. and just a dash of ursula. who does not spend this book dying on every other page, lucky girl. 
 the two things about life that resonated with me long after i closed the book had nothing to do with its structural playfulness, which seems to be ""the thing"" about the book that most people wanna talk about. and it should be talked about because it was risky and well-handled. but for me, that was more or less cosmetic. the things that shattered me were her writing about war and her glorification of english stoicism. and while this book doesn't have the same structure as life, it most definitely has these two focal points. 
 and they are just as good here as they were in life. i'm not big into wartime narratives, but atkinson has a gift. she takes the english experience during world war two and just dissects the crap out of it. whether it be in long chapters about teddy's experiences as a fighter pilot (sometimes too long, which is my sole complaint about this book, but that complaint is tied to my own tastes which balked at the very detailed descriptions of planes which are no doubt fascinating to people with an interest in military history), or in smaller stories about the way the war changed people - their sexual permissiveness, social restructuring, and - my second - that stiff upper lip. 
 if you're reading this review, you probably know me, and know my tastes. and a lot of what i enjoy, from steinbeck to hardy to grit lit are stories of endurance and adaptability in unforgiving circumstances. the triumph of the human spirit and man's struggle against forces of nature and hardship &yada. and this entire book is resting on the sturdy foundation of stoic forbearance. on doing what needs to be done. on making do and not making a fuss. 
 a perfect example of this: 
 it was when she had come down from the walls at monkgate bar and was waiting to cross the road at the traffic lights that a black curtain suddenly descended and covered her left eye...if she had gone completely blind she would have called for help, but the loss of only one eye didn't seem cause enough to involve complete strangers. 
 i mean, come on! that is stellar. 
 and also: 
 ... instead he had stayed and plodded on, because something told him that this was the life that had to be lived out...he preferred solitary pursuits, and being a member of a group seemed rather dutiful, but he could do dutiful and somebody had to or the world would fall apart. 
 and the book is just filled with that, same as in life. and it is also filled with stories, stories, stories, each one a soulhurting gem. three words: do.mi.nic. 
 i said that the book wasn't as structurally playful as life, but it does do a couple of things. we bounce around back and forth in time and voice: prewar, wartime, postwar, post-post war, with an overarching omniscient narrator casually inserting facts and fates that will happen in the future, which may or may not be fleshed out in later chapters. details will occur, and then recur in a different context, with different import. we will revisit meaningful objects through the eyes of several characters, who may not know what they are looking at. oh, and there's this one other thing. about which you will hear nothing from me. except that it's more reader-jarring than anything that happens in life. 
 don't read too many reviews of this book. i have been careful, but others may not be. go in cold and prepare to be blown away again by this woman's phenomenal storytelling abilities and her ability to write characters for whom you will care very deeply. and fear for, because we are at war, and you can be killed while sunbathing on a roof. 
 please, more, ms. atkinson!! jimmy!! izzie! maurice!! anyone! 
 .......................................................................................................... 
 this is only a four-star from me because it is not quite as good as life after life, which is like saying camembert is not quite as good as brie. it's practically a meaningless distinction, as i would eat either of those anytime, anywhere. for all intents and purposes, this is a five-star book. it should never be forgotten

 review: sarah's key by tatiana de rosnay 
 almost a hundred readers published their reviews on tatiana de rosnay's novel sarah's key. most of them rated the book in four or five stars, but some of them calling the novel ""mediocre"" showed a lower rating - three stars. it is necessary to admit that their opinions weren't unfounded and most critical comments were fair. however, from my standpoint, despite the fair critical comments (i don't think it is necessary to list them), the novel deserves a rather high rating, and i will try to explain why. 
 the book is devoted to the holocaust. the author describes two stories. one story is about the tragedy of a jewish girl named sarah. the story is based on historical fact. in 1942, on the orders of german military authorities, french police brutally arrested all jewish families in paris. almost all of them perished in concentration camps. 
 the second parallel story is about an american journalist, julia jermond, who, writing an article about vel' d'hiv's roundup, found out many horrible details of this crime committed by french police. france wanted to forget about its anti-human past and thoroughly concealed it. the author reminds us of those tragic facts. i am not going to retell the stories. they are already well known, but the book gave birth to some of my thoughts. 
 in her novel, the author writes with anxiety and great concern that people want to forget about the holocaust. one character of the book says: ""bringing back the past is never a good idea, especially whatever happened during the war. no one wants to be reminded of that, nobody wants to think about that."" the book demonstrates that such amnesia can be deadly. 
 for a long time naive people believed that the world moves in the direction of higher level of humanization. in their naivety, they missed the point when one of the most horrible and bloodthirsty variety of anthropoids (resembling humans) became active. russian anthropoids captured power in the soviet russia, invented concentration camps and, killing over a million innocent people yearly. over a period of 20 years they killed at least 20 million, maybe more. then world war ii broke out and the world forgot about the 20 million innocent victims. 
 humanlike anthropoids appeared in other countries, and people continued to believe that they were ordinary criminals. people's beliefs melted like a piece of paper in acid when the terrifying truth about fascist factories of deaths became known. people couldn't believe what they learned. using modern technology, fascist anthropoids made the killing of humans a branch of industry. for human beings, the holocaust is impossible to understand, it is just unexplainable. and the only way to prevent it from happening again is to never forget it. 
 the reviewed book is multidimensional, emotionally written but unfortunately, as it has been mentioned in some reviews, it has weak points as well. nevertheless, i was impressed with the book, its main message makes the readers think, and this is a sign of good literature. the advantage of the book is in the strong civic position of the author that, i think, has made the book a bestseller. 
 this book is about events which were not wide-known; it reminds people about the necessity to be alert. otherwise, the modern anthropoids will commit a new holocaust, and now all people can become their victims. they already are trying to convince us that there is nothing to remember; there wasn't a holocaust at all. 
 in general, the book is well written, and author's voice is strong. in my opinion, the book deserves not less than four stars. 
 everybody who cares about human life, who reads books not just for entertainment, will read this book with interest and will continue to return to it in his/her mind.

 there are many reviews already of this book, and i did wonder whether the world needed any more. but i disagree so strongly with some of the opinions expressed that i'm afraid i have to exercise my right to reply. two things in particular stand out. 
 let me deal with the simpler one first. some people seem appalled that the author is putting the guilt for this dreadful tragedy on the shoulders of a young girl. she didn't know what she was doing, they say; she was too young to understand the import of her actions, and we shouldn't hold her responsible. well, it seems to me that this is completely beside the point. the novel, we finally learn, has been written by the girl herself. she's giving herself the blame for what happened. she's evidently spent her whole life wondering why she behaved the way she did, and she still doesn't really know. she's just trying to get the story as straight as she can, mainly so that she can understand it herself, and i found her efforts extremely moving. if anyone is claiming that people don't behave this way, all i can say is that their view of human nature is so different from mine that it'll be hard to have a meaningful conversation on the subject. 
 so now the second and more controversial part. many reviewers dislike the post-modernist aspects. they complain that mcewan is taking a perverse pleasure in tricking the reader into a view of the story which is finally revealed as incorrect; that he's playing the unreliable narrator card out of sheer willfulness. again, i completely disagree. i don't think these aspects of the book are irrelevant or peripheral; i think they're at the very core of it, and are what make it a great piece of literature. mcewan shows us a girl who becomes an author precisely because she wants to expiate the dreadful feelings of guilt she has suffered all her life. he lets her explain how it happened, in what we eventually discover is a book within a book. and the truly awful thing is that she can't do it. she cops out with a fake happy ending, because she still can't face what she did. 
 i don't think this is a trick; i think he's saying something about the very nature of writing. many, many writers are like briony. they write to absolve themselves of their guilt, but in the end they don't say what they want to say. it's too horrible to write down. they skirt around the issues, and end up presenting them in a more favourable light. if they're lucky, they may finally reach an age when they are so far removed from what happened that they can tell the story straight. this is what briony does in the postscript, and i don't find it far-fetched. to take just one example, the first i happen to think of, look at marguerite duras. all her life, she kept thinking about her first love affair, and it coloured most of what she wrote. it was only when she was nearly 70 that she could set it down as l'amant. 
 before the events of the fountain, briony was indeed just a little girl; all she could write was the amusingly mediocre arabella. afterwards, she had something that was worth saying, though it took a long time to figure out how to do that. when she'd completed her task, she was able to get back to the one she was engaged in when she was interrupted: i love the circular structure, which ends with arabella being staged 60 years late. of the many infuriating changes in the movie version, i think i was most annoyed by the removal of this key scene. 
 wood burns, observes monty python's logician, as he gives an example of an incorrect syllogism; therefore, all that burns is wood. similarly, the fact that much trickery is post-modern does not imply that all post-modernism is trickery. this is a great and heart-felt novel.

 i've read that outlander was originally marketed as a romance novel because the publisher didn't know what else to do with it, but this book is no ordinary romance novel. it doesn't follow any typical romance formula and is a real genre bender that doesn't fit neatly into any one category. outlander has a swoon-worthy hero and dozens of truly romantic scenes that should be sufficient to satisfy even the most discriminating romance reader, while it's time travel aspect and a few references to witches and fairies should be of interest to readers of fantasy and paranormal stories. at it's heart though outlander is a historical novel rife with details of 18th century life in the scottish highlands both inside and outside a castle or large estate. it also recounts some of the events leading up to the jacobite pretender's uprising of 1745. diana gabaldon is an amazing writer who delves deep into her character's lives and the history surrounding them, painting an extraordinary picture that truly transports the reader to another time and place. 
 claire is an incredibly strong heroine, who can sometimes be a bit brash and sassy, but deep down she is a kind and caring person at heart. she adapts amazingly well to a new time and place, much better than most people ever would if faced with the dilemma she was. claire is a very intelligent woman who uses every ounce of knowledge at her disposal to reverse her predicament, while helping others, especially with their medical needs, and bringing a much needed modern perspective to ancient methods. she somehow finds the courage to made difficult choices in an era when choices were sometimes few or non-existent, especially for women, and to do what needs to be done, when it needs to be done. claire is stubborn and persistent even in the face of nearly impossible odds. best of all she is a pillar of strength to her beloved jamie as much as he is to her, and she has a powerful underlying passion that matches his own for her. 
 jamie, in my opinion, is the best romantic hero ever to be penned by an author. he exhibits both physical and mental strength, as well as a strength of character, that go above and beyond any ordinary romantic hero. his word is his honor, and his commitment to that honor is moving beyond words. if only there were more men in reality who could be so easily trusted and taken at their word. jamie shows a deep respect, not just for claire, but for all the women with whom he comes in contact, a true gentleman in every sense of the word. on the outside, jamie is tough as nails, enduring more physical pain than any one person should ever be expected to, while on the inside, he is kind, gentle and sensitive, often instinctively knowing things that others don't. he is thoroughly intelligent and well-educated and often beautifully poetic in his speech. he is lighthearted and self-deprecating, never taking himself too seriously. i loved the way he was always teasing claire. jamie is simply a wonderful character, a man who loves selflessly and with his whole being. 
 there is much to enjoy about this book. together, jamie and claire make a formidable couple, and it is obvious from the outset that they are soulmates. their absolute trust in each other, basically from the moment they meet, is in and of itself, romance at it's finest. there are no contrived misunderstandings between them, only naked honesty, which brings an openness and vulnerability to both characters that is breathtaking. i love the way the author creates a beautiful friendship between these two characters before they end up at the altar and of course then become lovers. what's even better though is how that friendship continues to blossom and grow deeper and deeper even after they are married. the intimacy level of these two characters is something i rarely see in a novel, and most of it has little or nothing to do with sexual interludes. during the times when jamie and claire were apart even for short periods of time, i simply couldn't wait for them to be reunited, as the two of them together absolutely electrify the pages. all the secondary characters are extremely well-crafted and surprisingly well fleshed out, even those who play only minor parts. the setting is beautifully rendered as well, almost becoming a character unto itself. the time travel aspect adds an extended element of intrigue, and ms. gabaldon has certainly taken the time to think through the ramifications of such a feat if it were indeed possible. every scene simply adds to the richness of detail in the book, and there is nothing that i felt was excess. the author's care in seamlessly weaving all of the elements together is evident all throughout the book. 
 while there are many things to love about this story, there were a few events that bothered me just a bit. there was a scene in which jamie beats claire with his sword belt for disobedience. the scene in and of itself actually did not bother me much, because i fully understood his reasons for doing so and he later took a vow never to do it again. what did bother me was his admission that he enjoyed it. the admission was made in a fairly lighthearted manner. in light of that, i suppose it might have been meant as humorous, but perhaps it was too subtle for me to fully appreciate. even so, i might not have thought much of it except for the fact that the villain in this story is a brutal sadist. for that reason, i found myself a bit annoyed at having the hero of the story exhibit even a hint of such a tendency. there were also a couple of scenes of what i would term rather intense and rough lovemaking, one of which began with jamie behaving in a dominant manner, and neither of which were quite to my taste. they just seemed a bit out of character for jamie, who up to this point, and following, was always a gentle and considerate though passionate lover. i will allow though for the fact that jamie apologized for the first incident and admitted equality after the second. finally, there was a scene in which jamie related a prior incident with a secondary character in his youth, which by today's standards would have been nothing short of an act of child molestation against him, but which was treated rather casually by all involved. i wanted to reconcile this in a historical perspective, but as hard as i tried, i simply couldn't. i also feel compelled to warn sensitive readers that there is an incidence of brutal sexual violence near the end of the book. it is not played out in real-time, but instead is related a bit at a time through dialog and implication, but still is immensely palpable in the intensity of it's aftereffects on the psyche of the character who was the victim. i'm not usually overly squeamish about such things, but i have to admit to having some difficulty reading these passages. more than once, they brought tears to my eyes. 
 in spite of the things i have mentioned though, outlander is still by far one of the best books i have ever read. i have to give ms. gabaldon extra points for all of her attention to details. it is a joy to read such an intelligently-written and meticulously-researched novel that is so rich in detail. it went far beyond my expectations for a debut novel for any author. it even sparked my interest in learning more about the time and place that is depicted in it. outlander is the type of book that is so engrossing and compelling that it makes one want to read straight through without ever putting it down, though it's epic length makes that somewhat unfeasible. this was my second reading of the book, and it certainly won't be my last. it has a earned a permanent place on my keeper shelf along with it's sequels dragonfly in amber, voyager, drums of autumn, the fiery cross, and a breath of snow and ashes all of which continue jamie and claire's story. this book is two, two, two books in one! 
 sorry, that was annoying. but it's almost as if erik larson wrote two really short books--one about the 1893 world's columbian exposition and another about the murder spree of dr. h. h. holmes--and then shoved them together to create a single story. the result isn't bad, and i think larson is successful at maintaining clean seams between the two narratives, but it's hard to argue these two occurrences are anything but abstractedly related. yes, holmes lived in chicago at the time of the fair and lured a bunch of people to his murder castle (he be snatchin' yo' people up!), but the events didn't weigh heavily on the fair itself or on the atmosphere surrounding it. no alarm bells went off anywhere in chicago as a result of his, um, unsavory indiscretions. 
 still, there is a lot of interesting stuff here, information specific to the world's fair, and it is fun to learn new things. for example, the chicago columbian exposition exudes a long list of firsts: it saw the invention of the world's first ferris wheel, it led the nation in its first public observance of the pledge of allegiance, and it helped to establish alternating current as the industry standard for electricity distribution. even that awful snake charmer song has its origins in the chicago world's fair. 
 while writing this review, i've come to learn that leonardo dicaprio, that beautiful man with the screaming cherry tomato head on a toothpick body, is producing the film adaptation, and will also play the role of serial killer h. h. holmes. for this i am pleased. in many important ways, the reflections of marcus aurelius (121-180) crystallize the philosophical wisdom of the greco-roman world. this little book was written as a diary to himself while emperor fighting a war out on the boarder of the roman empire and today this book is known to us as the meditations. 
 the roman philosophers are not as well known or as highly regarded as greek philosophers such as plato, aristotle, epicurus, or zeno the stoic - and for a simple reason: the roman thinkers were not primarily interested in abstract theory; rather, they were concerned with behavior, that is, understanding how to live in the everyday world and putting their understanding into practice; the goal being to live the life of an authentic philosopher, to be a person of high character and integrity, to develop inner strength and a quiet mind and value such strength and quietude above all else. indeed, to accomplish such a lofty goal, the romans realized the need for radical transformation, a complete overhauling of one's life through rigorous mental and physical training, like turning base metal into pure gold. and once a person takes on the role of a philosopher, their deeds must reflect their words - no hypocrisy, thank you! thus, it isn't surprising the romans put a premium on memorizing and internalizing simple proverbs and maxims and employed the metaphor of philosophy as the medicine to cure a sick soul. 
 turning now to marcus aurelius, we can appreciate how he imbibed the wisdom not only from the stoics (along with seneca and epictetus, marcus is considered one of the three major roman stoics), but he was also willing to learn from the schools of epicurus, plato and aristotle. in the greco-roman world, being eclectic was perfectly acceptable; truth was valued over who said what. 
 we find several recurring themes in the meditations: develop self-discipline to gain control over judgments and desires; overcoming a fear of death; value an ability to retreat into a rich, interior mental life (one's inner citadel); recognize the world as a manifestation of the divine; live according to reason; avoid luxury and opulence. but generalizations will not approach the richness and wisdom nuggets a reader will find in marcus's actual words. thus, i conclude with my personal observations coupled with quotes from book one, wherein marcus begins by expressing heartfelt thanks to his family and teachers for the many fine lessons he learned as a youth. here are four of my favorites: 
 ""not to have frequented public schools, and to have had good teachers at home"" ---------- after my own nasty experience with the mindless competition and regimentation of public schools, i wish i had marcus's good fortune of excellent home schooling. 
 ""not to meddle with other people's affairs, and not to be ready to listen to slander."" ---------- i didn't need a teacher here; i recognized on my own at an early age that gossip is a colossal waste of time and energy, both listening to gossip and spreading gossip. i can't imagine a clearer indication of a base, coarse mind than someone inclined to gossip and slandering others. 
 ""to read carefully, and not to be satisfied with a superficial understanding of a book."" ---------- how true. reading isn't a race to get to the last page; matter of fact, i agree with jorge luis borges that focused, precise rereading is the key to opening oneself to the wisdom of a book. 
 ""to be satisfied on all occasions, and be cheerful."" ---------- i'm never in a hurry. life is too beautiful to be in a hurry. for me, there is only one way to live each day: in joy and free from anxiety and worry. in a sense, all of the meditations of marcus aurelius amplify this simple view of life. 
 i've written this review as an encouragement to make marcus aurelius a part of your life. you might not agree with everything he has to say, but you have to admit, marcus has a really cool beard and head of hair. kate atkinson has written a lovely, accordion-fold of a novel here. 
 this is not a jackson brodie novel, which are always much better than your typical detective novels, (even though i haven't read the last one yet - merp), but this one is just so much more ambitious in scope and style than even those gems. 
 it is sublime. 
 at its most simplistic, it is about ursula, a character who will be born and die all in the first two pages. (excluding what i am considering to be a prologue) and then again. and again. she will die from falling off a roof, from drowning, from gas-inhalation, but she will be reborn again to live a collage of different lives, but always as ursula, and always surrounded by the same family. sometimes she can remember her past go-rounds, in hazy half-memories, and sometimes she can remember more, but this is not some hippy-dippy exploration of spiritual reincarnation. i have never read a book that is more human, more terrestrial. it is not necessarily about ""getting it right"" although you cheer inside every time she manages to avoid the decisions that led to some of her more horrifying deaths. it is more about our possible paths, about family, about history.it is about ripples and traps and the horrors of war. 
 and, oh, war. i have read many books about england during wartime, whether it be i or ii. but never have i read one with more immediacy than this one. she does such a fantastic job with this particular material. not just the parts that you would think i would respond to, being of a ghoulish bent. the ""recovery of the bodies"" scenes were very graphic and haunting and shivery, yes, but i found myself responding not to the shocking descriptions, but more to the quieter scenes, the ones which are focused on the national character during wartime. 
 the englishness of this novel is just brilliant. there is such a pervading sense of ""one does as one must and then one has tea"" throughout. 
 on the way back from lunch, sylvie said she wanted to visit oberpollingers and buy a present for hugh. when they reached the department store they found the windows daubed with anti-jewish slogans and sylvie said, ""gracious, what a mess."" the shop was open for business but a pair of grinning louts in sa uniform were loitering in front of the doors, putting people off from entering. not sylvie, who had marched past the brownshirts while ursula reluctantly trailed in her wake into the store and up the thickly carpeted staircase. in the face of the uniforms, ursula had shrugged a cartoon helplessness and murmured rather shamefacedly, ""she's english."" she thought that sylvie didn't understand what it was like living in germany but in retrospect she thought that perhaps sylvie had understood very well. 
 i love that passage, on at least three different levels. the brisk insouciance of a mother accustomed to living in an imperial nation, the shame of a transplanted daughter living in a changing country whose climate she is becoming a part of, but doesn't yet fully understand, and the latent judgment passing as ignorance. 
 and this, which perfectly sums up the english spirit: 
 ""no point in thinking,"" she said briskly, ""you just have to get on with life. we only have one after all, we should try and do our best. we can never get it right, but we must try."" 
 i loved that about this book. it is practical, unhysterical perfection. there is a determination to these characters in the face of horrors and lives lived always on the brink of destruction that is admirable and almost uplifting. you know, if it weren't for all the bombs. 
 this book killed me, it really did. and then i was reborn, as a reader. it is such a labor of love; you can feel how much thought atkinson put into it, with all of its carefully-sprinkled echoes from former life-plots, and how lovingly-rendered are even the smallest supporting characters (mr. emslie!! ). 
 obviously, i love izzie, the free-spirited drunken floozie of an aunt, even though she is such a selfish character. but that's kind of what this book is about - how when we are living our lives, we miss a great deal of what is happening around us, and if we had a chance to step back, to see the bigger picture, we might make different decisions, and in some cases, we could change the course of history.which sounds trite, but kate atkinson is a much more accomplished writer than i am, and this book is an absolute triumph. 
 you will have to wait until april to read this, unless you are greg, and are getting it friday, and then it will be mailed off to canada to bill. and it is a beautiful-looking arc:

 he flipped onto his back and lay there, blinking up at the ceiling. ""until just now, i would have said there was nothing remaining that could surprise me in bed. i was wrong."" 
 whatever you do, do not read this book at work unless you want to be thought insane for bursting into laughter. like all of the books in this series, this story is utterly adorable. never has a tale starting in blackmail been so romantic. 
 yeah, you heard me. romantic. blackmail. i solemnly proclaim myself sane, with a fierce hatred for assholes. the love interest in this book blackmails the heroine into marriage. i know that's a bad start for any tale, but believe me when i say that this story was so good. i assure you there is no abuse. i assure you that the love interest and his motives are noble (if questionable...i mean, it's still blackmail.) i am not a fan of assholes. i assure you, you will love this book. 
 16-year old maddie is dreadfully shy. she has a stepmother that she wishes were an evil stepmother. instead, lovely anne wants to dress maddie up and give her a season so maddie can find her one twoo wuv. 
 an absolutely horrifying thought. 
 maddie has what we would call today social anxiety disorder. she is terrified of crowds. she is quite accomplished as an amateur artist, happiest in her own company, sketching nature...like the mating rituals of a pair of lobsters, lovingly named fluffy and rex. so in order to avoid coming out and facing people, maddie invents an imaginary lover, logan mackenzie. a brave, brave soldier who has fallen in love with her at first sight. 
 logan mackenzie. suddenly her not-real suitor had a name. by the end of the afternoon, he had hair (brown), eyes (blue), a voice (deep, with a highland burr), a rank (captain), and a personality (firm, but intelligent and kind). 
 she writes letters to an imaginary lover and ships it off to god knows where. 
 my dear imaginary captain mackenzie, you are not real and never will be. i, however, am a true and eternal fool. 
 here, have a drawing of a snail. 
 after 5 years, the guilt of constantly lying to her loved ones drew on her conscience, and thusly maddie makes the sad decision of killing captain logan off. nine years after her invention of logan, 24-year old maddie is living a happy life in an inherited scottish castle when a zombie comes to the door. that is, logan. what are the odds? the real logan has been receiving and reading her letters all these years. the real logan is nothing like what she imagined. 
 his hair was overlong (mostly brown, with hints of ginger), and his squared jaw sported several days' growth of whiskers (mostly ginger, with hints of brown). broad shoulders tapered to a trim torso. a simple black sporran was slung low around his waist, and a sheathed dirk rode his hip. below the fall of his kilt, muscled, hairy legs disappeared into white hose and scuffed black boots. 
 he's mad. he's scottish. he's kilted. was there ever a more terrifying combination? logan didn't just show up for shits and giggles, he's got a mission in mind. marriage to maddie. he intends to take the castle and the lands surrounding it, lands so conveniently owned by maddie. if she doesn't marry him, he will expose her letters, ridiculing her and her family. maddie is unwilling to put herself and her family through that humiliation...and therefore agrees to a marriage of convenience. 
 but, naturally, all is not what it seems. come on, this is a romance novel. logan is not a nefarious asshole. he has only recently returned from the war, scarred, broken, with his similarly battle-worn band of men. they have lost their lands due to their evil english landlords. logan is determined to protect his men at all cost. he is their captain. they've been through so much together; it is his responsibility to take care of them. 
 it wasn't supposed to be this way. when the regiment had landed at dover last autumn, they'd been greeted as triumphant heroes in london. then they'd marched north. home, to the highlands. and he'd watched his men's lives and dreams fall apart at the seams, one by one. 
 callum wasn't the only one. the men gathered around him represented the last of his discharged soldiers, and the worst off: the homeless, the wounded, the left behind. 
 they'd fought bravely, survived battle, won the war for england on the promise of coming home to their families and sweethearts--only to find their families, homes, and sweethearts gone. pushed off the lands they'd inhabited for centuries by the same greedy english landlords who'd asked them to fight. 
 and logan couldn't do a damned thing about it. until today. 
 naturally, attraction grows between them, and logan discovers that maddie is not the spoiled english heiress he'd expected. she is kind, caring, loving to her tenants. a brilliant artist. a thoroughly intelligent young woman with a crippling fear of crowds. which isn't to say she doesn't have her oddities. 
 maddie had always been different from other girls, and she had always known it. for example, she was certain she was the only bride to ever write the following to-do list on her wedding day: 
 *	bath 
 *	coiffure 
 *	dress 
 *	lobsters 
 and maddie realizes that---oddly enough, she now has a friend. 
 a realization struck her like a lightning bolt. she now had a confidant. a conspirator. someone who knew everything. all her secrets. he didn't love her for them, but he hadn't run screaming from her, either. 
 this ruthless, kilted stranger she'd married might be the closest thing on earth maddie had to a true friend. 
 maddie is not without guile...she is not spineless, and if logan expects her to play this charade, she will make him pay for it.like making him read a love poem he allegedly wrote her. 
 ""were i a bird, i'd sing for thee. 
 were i a bee, i'd sting for thee. 
 were i a peak, i'd tower for thee. 
 were i a tree, i'd flower for thee. 
 were i a flute--"" 
 the reading was interrupted as callum began to cough with alarming violence. rabbie slapped him on the back with vigor. 
 ""do i need to stop?"" logan asked. ""are you dying?"" 
 callum shook his head. 
 ""because i wouldna mind it if you were dying."" 
 ""no, no."" at length callum looked up with a reddened face and choked out, ""dinna mind me. do go on."" 
 ""were i a flute, i'd play for thee. 
 were i a steed, i'd neigh for thee."" 
 and against her will, maddie finds himself falling for the man behind that steely exterior. 
 and now, despite all her best attempts to avoid it, here it came. 
 her heart started telling her a dangerous, dangerous tale. the story of a decent, loyal man who'd treasured her letters, dreamed of her nightly, survived battles and marched across continents to come home--not to a castle or a glen but to her. and even now, when he held her in his arms, he lacked the words to explain all the emotion in his heart. 
 it was nothing but a silly fiction. 
 it had to be. 
 and like a gentleman, logan doesn't immediately attempt to consummate his marriage. he waits. and waits. and waits. he waits so long that he has to endure the teasing of his men---who see fit to give him some advice about seducing his wife. 
 rabbie hunched over to whisper. ""she's got to see him with his kit off. shirt, plaid, all of it."" 
 a coarse whoop rose up from the men. 
 ""no, i mean it,"" rabbie said, standing up. ""here's how it goes. you rise early one morning, captain. choose a misty one, when the gloom's settled like a blanket over the valley."" 
 he waved his flattened hand before them like an artist painting a landscape. ""you strip down to your skin, and then you have a dip in the loch. wait until she comes looking for you. because she will. they always do. but pretend not to notice when she does. and then--just when she's close enough to see and she's been watching for a while, you rise up out of the water. like a dolphin. or a mermaid. shooting up through the mist and pushing your hair back with both hands""--rabbie thrust both hands through his hair to demonstrate--""with all the little beads of water trickling down over the ridges of your shoulders and chest."" he danced his fingers down his belly. ""like so."" 
 i can't tell you how many times this book made me laugh. it was so sweet. i've sang the praises of this series since the first book, and with good reason. everyone, even a hardened, crude soul like me needs a little cuteness, and och, man, this was feckin' adorable. it's not easy to write a review for a book when said book is tightly held against your chest. 
 my lady jane is wonderful and so, so magical i want to keep it close to me for an indefinite amount of time. 
 you might wonder: three authors... three different point of views... three stories intertwined? how will that play out? 
 comically, apparently. 
 this key to having a great time with this beautiful piece of fiction is to not take it too seriously. 
 sometimes absurd, sometimes silly but always charming, my lady jane will not let you fall into boredom. 
 the chapters are brimming with humour, romance, adventure and absolutely delightful characters! 
 it's said to be an alternative fantasy story of lady jane grey, and while i am not a fan of historical fiction, i adored this one to bits. 
 as i said earlier, it's not meant to be taken seriously. really, it's all for your entertainment and the many changes that were made to lady jane grey's real story are so interesting because they're original and unexpected and definitely diverting. 
 for a book that was written by three different authors, they certainly nailed the point of views. the writing flowed. there is no abrupt change in the writing style; everything is smoothly done. 
 it works. everything does: the not-so-proper-to-the-century writing style (--the word ''vampire'' clearly didn't exist during that era!), the light atmosphere, the shape-shifting element, the many dangers and adventures and awkward yet fun situations the characters are put in. 
 i never read the princess bride before (though i am not unfamiliar with the movie adaptation) but knowing they have much in common automatically places it to the top of my tbr pile! 
 one last thought: it's very rare for me to read five hundred pages this fast, but it's hard not to breeze through my lady jane. even putting it down for a second will not be an easy thing to do. 
 blog | youtube | twitter | instagram | google+ | bloglovin' i liked this book more than amy poehler's or issa rae's or ellen degeneres' or sloane crosley's or laurie notaro's. i liked it less than mindy kaling's or caitlin moran's or lindy west's or roxane gay's or jessi klein's or melissa broder's or tina fey's. but more than anything else i am grateful that there are so many interesting, troubled, funny, wise, extraordinary female voices that i can read and relate to and be horrified and inspired by. this series changed my life. i cannot even begin to go into the details of how much i fell in love with the main characters: claire beauchamp and jamie fraser. the love story between these two beautifully written characters actually transcends time and logic. their devotion, respect and soul-reaching love was one of beauty and even awe inspiring. theirs is a long and beautiful historic journey together reaching limits and boundaries of both heartwarming depth and gut-wrenching tragedy. not to be cryptic, it's just that this indescribable story is meant to be told through the words of the brilliant author, diana gabaldon. 
 fyi...this is an incredibly long series, with 7 books published, (most average 1,000 pages), with an 8th book due in 2014. it's a commitment to say the least, but very worth the absolute loveliness that is gabaldon's brilliant and stunning love story. my words will never do this series justice. this book was so beautiful and haunting. i fell in love with so many of the characters, and loved how their lives were weaved together. knowing the time period this was set in, i knew the ending would hurt. and it did, though i didn't shed as many tears as i expected. 
 the writing was incredible, the descriptions so vivid. it did a superb job of showing the reader how the characters felt through their actions, rather than telling. whilst the short chapters (on average 1.5 pages) helped to make this read a little quicker, it was still quite a slow book. i really enjoyed being able to savour it and get to know the characters, however there were some points where it felt a little too dense and slow. there are many reasons why i wouldn't like this book: 
 1. i hate feeling dumb. 
 2. it's set in ancient israel, 70 c.e. to be exact, and the fact that i had to ask what c.e. meant --being a child of b.c and a.d --did not go over well (refer to #1) 
 3. it's set in ancient israel and i, shamefully, have absolutely no clue what happened back then. i mean... besides the last temptation of christ and bible stories that i kind of sort of remember. (#1) 
 4. the author also wrote practical magic, which i have not read but i have seen the movie and besides it being pretty damn awful, i got a serious complex having to look at nicole kidman and sandra bullock slink around in little black dresses. and she's also a favorite of oprah which causes controversy on its own level that i don't care to go into but still am squeamish about... 
 5. hype. wasn't it one of the books nominated for a gr book of the year? 
 6. it's a book that one of my co-workers would look at and say 'oh, i've read that!' (a definite sign to stay away) 
 7.it's set in masada... and i don't know about you, but i had no idea what masada was. maybe it's my titanic, i don't know. but, going off of #1, i didn't like it when i mentioned this to a friend and he said 'oh, when all the jews killed themselves and their families rather than be captured by the romans, what a massacre!! and i was only about 200 pages into it and had already started to care for some of the characters and well, hate it when surprises are ruined. (run-on sentence, whatever...)and.. well (#1) 
 so, yes, there were many challenges to face reading this book. i'm not even sure why it was on my to-read list... it's not like any of you suggested it to me. or, i think i might have run across this ditty at some point because i had a deja vu type moment when i read it: 
 ""for those who say that the witch of moab never loved anyone, that she was selfish, concerned with her own fate alone, i can only say that she was ruined by love and delivered by it and that she left something glorious to the word, a child who loves to stand in the rain."" 
 okay, yes, you've written it off as a chick lit book. i get it. i would too based on that.. which is, by the way, on the last page of the novel and couldn't have ruined my opinion of the story no how. 
 this book is elegant. that's probably the highest praise that i can bestow right now. i crave to be elegant. i am clumsy and messy and blabber and start sentences with 'and' and disregard all my 7th grade english teacher, mrs. van houten, taught me about punctuation. 
 the story is based on actual events, you can even see some of the items mentioned in it at museums and such. but, what hoffman has done has created characters around this story. the lives of four dovekeepers and the people who surround them. she presents them to you in such a way that you actually feel like you were handling doves (that is, if you liked them... and c'mon... too many weddings show that the cliche is true.) the women are capable and graceful and intelligent. they have a quiet strength and live with many ghosts. they have all come to masada for different reasons and fate leads them to one another and we hear each of their stories in their own voice. the assassin's daughter. the baker's wife. the warrior's beloved. the witch of moab. 
 hoffman's writing style was simple, short sentences. statements, rather. but, beautifully written, so much so that i would find myself going back to the pages that i marked off to re-read passages. so much said in so little fashion. ""i took my hand from his. he looked like ice, but ice is known to burn."" or "" when the wind is so strong that we women know we will choke on the rising dust if we fail to tie our scarves across our faces, boys will always ignore the elements and race through storm clouds, dreaming of glory."" 
 the first page of the book, before the map even, has this written on it: 
 ""let my burden be your burden, and yours be mine."" 
 much better than that crap people recite from that wedding song. life is hard. people die and people suffer and the most honorable thing you can do is help carry the weight. good grief if i had even one textbook half this enthralling in high school, who knows what kind of impassioned -ologist i would have grown up to be. i hereby petition bryson to re-write all curriculum on behalf of the history of the world. 
 i would run across things half-remembered from midterms and study guides and think, ""you mean this is what they were talking about? you have got to be kidding me."" it's never condescending, always a joy. 
 in fact, what i loved most is the acute, childlike sense of wonder seeping through the pages. how fantastic little we know about the world in which we live. all the great scientific leaps fallen through the cracks, all the billions of leaps that will never be made, every scientist who with an amiable grin shrugs to say, ""i don't know. we don't know. who has any idea?"" the world is a magically baffling, enchanting place, and after nearly everything there is infinitesimally more. i had such high hopes for this book, but it turns out that now i'll be writing one of my only truly negative reviews on goodreads... 
 sophia amoruso has surely accomplished a lot with nasty gal, and i respect her work ethic and ability to achieve success with rough beginnings and little formal education. however, i expected this book to relate more to those in her generation - instead, she turns out to be yet another naysayer of the millennial generation, writing them off as lazy and spoiled. for someone in her early thirties with a lot of life left to live, she often puts herself up on a pedestal and talks down to readers, taking herself more seriously than necessary. also, she seems frustratingly lacking in self-awareness and empathy - she often writes as though everything she has earned is wholly ""deserved"" and that the universe provided what she was ""owed"", without honestly acknowledging that many out there who have likely worked harder and longer than her haven't gotten nearly as much success. for example, at one point she writes about how bringing children to a job interview is an immediate turn-off for her; does she not realize how many single parents in poverty cannot afford childcare? how else are they supposed to make money to provide for their family? this is only one instance out of many where she lacks the ability to relate to those less fortunate than herself. in fact, she spends a whole chapter refuting the idea of luck, and claiming that her ""positive thinking"" brought opportunities to her... nice thought, but it comes across as entitled and naive. 
 while there are moments of amusing anecdotes and inspiring stories, in general it seems that amoruso has little more than tired old cliches to offer in terms of business advice. the last ten years have mutated my views on religion. i went from a vague agnostic live-and-let-live attitude to a full blown distrust and dislike of mass worshipping of mysterious deities. when it wasn't being used as an excuse to murder people who believed different things, then it was being used to deny basic scientific concepts or prevent consenting adults from marriage based on gender. overall, i'd become convinced that humanity was far too stupid to use religion as anything but yet another system to justify telling someone else how to live. 
 so naturally, one of my favorite novels of the last ten years is a funny and touching book about the life of jesus. 
 yeah, it was that kind of decade. 
 the story is told by jesus's best friend, biff. actually, biff quickly explains that jesus was known as josh back in the days when they were kids in nazareth. biff knows there is something special about josh from the moment they meet, and he adopts a life-long role of dealing with the practical matters that the naive josh tends to overlook. when teen-aged josh decides to track down the wise men who attended his birth to see what they can teach him about how he should become the messiah, biff knows he has to go along to protect josh from an evil world. 
 together, they travel across asia, invent sarcasm, learn alchemy, discover coffee and become kung fu experts as josh prepares himself to one day return home and fulfill his ultimate destiny. 
 it's no surprise that christopher moore could write a very funny book about the life of jesus. what is surprising that he's able to make it so touching that even a cynical non-believer such as myself could be moved by it. by focusing in on the basic love-thy-neighbor concepts that josh fiercely preaches, moore wrote a warm reminder of what christianity is supposed to be about. why do people rate books before reading them? this skews the ratings and i wish people wouldn't do so... 
 this was my most anticipated book of all time. i couldn't wait to read and and naturally was a bit let down. my least favorite of his three. 
 i found the voice in some of the chapters a bit awkward. 
 the characters were interesting and well developed for the most part. i didn't like how the author chose to weave everything together. 
 there were some very well done parts -some moments that were very beautiful. i'm glad i read this but won't anticipate the next book nearly as much although i will definitely read the next one hoping to experience something powerful. when i was 16 my great aunt pauline told me the saddest true story. i asked her about her background, she was of polish decent in a completely german town in washington state. she told me that when her family came over from poland her mother had pink eye, and was sent back to poland to try again. she was pregnant and when she got back, she had a child that was not listed on the papers. she put the baby in a suitcase to keep the officials at ellis island from finding her and separating her again. that baby was pauline. they went out west, and her mother died several years later in child birth. pauline remembered being set out on the porch with her younger siblings, the babies in a laundry basket, and her father standing on the porch as people came by to pick out who they wanted. she was older and chosen last and by a couple with a different language and moved to this area she ended up in. she said, ""they picked us out as if we were puppies in a basket. i am not a puppy in a basket."" i am crying just remembering the pain in her voice when she told me this. she told me she didn't see any of her siblings until she was an adult, and that the couple trained her in how to be a good worker. what a childhood for one of the sweetest women i ever knew. i wish i had recorded her story, asked more questions, there is never enough time. this book told a similar tale, and i could not put it down. it rang so true. read it! fantastic! amy poehler is so funny and relatable and inspirational. i especially loved learning about how she got into comedy and improv (as that's something i'm interested in myself) and just her general attitude and perspective is so refreshing and positive. i actually listened to the audiobook for half of this and it was brilliant--amy's narration just makes this extra fun and hilarious. overall, this was an awesome memoir! (and the parks and rec bit at the end just gave me so many feelings, ugh it was painfully beautiful.) mfysh fyd@

 mhmd l`rby this book was wonderful, intense, and quite frankly exhausting. it truly was a ride. i had some minor problems with this and i mean minor so i am giving it a 4.85 haha 
 those problems were pure maiden trope got slightly old and happiness was so closely related only to sex which got a little repetitive. 
 i might/ probably will be doing a mini review on this 
 ~2017 update~ lowering the rating because the maiden trope mentioned earlier is more problematic than my naive self picked up on 3 years ago. it's pretty dang creep sketch. kept it at 2 stars because the russian war setting is still done well. very candid account of growing up disadvantaged and white. the parallels between his demographic and a historically, systematically marginalized black america are evident. both populations deserve understanding and empathy, but i tend to think the author thinks his people are somehow more noble. i would have like to seen an acknowledgment that the two groups should not be antagonistic but work together to achieve mutually beneficial economic goals. i cannot write a review that can do this book justice. this is what goes through my head: 
 * i am so happy i give few books five stars, because then when i run into a book this good my five star rating means something! 
 * you need a strong stomach for this book. i have warned you. 
 * once you start you will not be able to read or do anything else. 
 * there is no humor in this book. i always need humor, except not here. don't ask me why! i just didn't need it. i was riveted from start to finish. i needed to understand the relationships that lie at the core of what happened. i was so focused on understanding the why, i didn't have any need for humor. humor simply doesn't belong in this book. this is nordic historical fiction of times long past - there is hunger and cold and darkness. that is the way it was. and people living in such difficult times did such twisted things. 
 * the book is not spooky, it is atmospheric. 
 * the writing! similes, metaphors - they are all just perfect. stunning writing. 
 * you will be moved. jeez, at the end...... no, not just at the end, all the way through. 
 * and this is very important. do not read this book. please, if you possibly can, listen to it. the narration by morven christie is totally fantastic. the icelandic is perfect. the tempo is slow and it must be slow, so you can think about what is being said, so you feel the doom and darkness of the events. this is an excellently written book and excellently narrated. both! 
 phew, after this i don't want another nordic drama for a long time. my emotions cannot take it. i have been through a wringer with this one. 
 i assume you have read the book description, so you know that this story is based on true events. there is a chapter at the end that explains all the research involved. the author closely follows what is known. there are different views of agnes' behavior, but the author has totally convinced my of what her study of the facts have lead her to believe. 
 this is one of the best books i have read/listened to this year. 
 ************************************** 
 after half: 
 i have listened to half now. i still absolutely love it. it has love too. one of the few authors that can feed me a love story and please me immensely. i am convinced agnes did not kill the man she is accused of killing. but history says she is beheaded for this reason. remember this is nordic historical fiction! now i will say no more. i don't know what will happen in the rest of the book, so i cannot possibly give a spoiler. 
 you read this book for the marvelous atmosphere and the lines. gorgeous lines! a superb writer. 
 ***************************** 
 after 6 chapters: 
 this book is beautifully written. atmospheric. nordic historical fiction at its best. the narration by morven christie is wonderful too. don't read it, listen to it. i have only listened to 6 chapters, but there is no way this book can get anything but 5 stars. 
 hannah kent is australian, mentored by geraldine brooks! this book is far better than any i have read by geraldine brooks, and i am not disparaging brooks when i say that. how to write a successful book: 
 1. nude photo of self on cover 
 2. clever title parody

 _________________________________________ 
 well, if this is a book then the above is a review. let's state it up front. this is a great book. not a pretty good book with some nice qualities, but a powerful, beautiful, thoughtful and incredibly moving work of art that will be read for generations. the orchardist is even more incredible for being a first novel, the best first i have read since edgar sawtelle. yes, that good. 
 talmadge had lived forty years in the orchard without any exceptional event happening to him, barring inclement weather or some horticultural phenomenon. nothing to speak of in the human realm, really. and then this happened. 
 he had had a tough time of it. after the mining death of his father in 1857, when he was nine years old, his mother traveled with him and his sister, elspeth, north and west until they found a suitable piece of land in what is now washington state. there they set up a farm. three years later mom passes, and talmadge and his one-year-younger sister are left on their own to run it. oh, and toss in a bout of smallpox that he manages to survive a few years later. a year after that, at the ripe old age of 17, his sister takes off. some childhood. when we meet talmadge he is well into middle age. one day while at the market with his produce, he spots two filthy teen-age girls stealing some of his apples and everything changes. 
 talmadge is a man who has lived most of his life alone. with the arrival of these girls he sees a chance to have what he always wanted, a family. but they are toting more than just hunger and the bulges in their young bellies. the girls had had a particularly difficult youth, orphaned very young, ill used after, and their fear makes it difficult for them to accept talmadge as someone they can trust. they take up residence on his land. he takes care of them as much as they will allow. when the man from whom they are fleeing arrives, events take a very dark turn. 
 the core story of the novel is talmadge's struggle to save one of these runaways from the darkness both without and within, what he gains, loses, experiences and learns. you will love him. he is a good, good man, trying his very best in extremely trying circumstances. he will spend the rest of his life trying to do right by the young lives that have been placed into his hands, despite their resistance. maybe in doing this talmadge is doing what he hoped someone would have done for his long-vanished sister. one of his charges travels a similar path, searching always for that connection to her lost one. 
 he has two amazing friends. clee is a mute nez perce who talmadge has known since arriving, and caroline middey is a local healer, a sort of big sister for him. the depiction of talmadge's friendships with clee and caroline is rich and incredibly moving. coplin has made many of her subsidiary characters come alive. 
 the text is sewn with descriptions of small pieces of this verdant and sometimes harsh world. these passages glow, capturing the vibrant beauty of the land, the affection the residents have for it and the depth of their connection. coplin has a gift for description. you can feel the warm sun on your skin, the breeze brushing past your cheek as it ripples fields of grass 
 he did not articulate it as such, but he thought of the land as holding his sister--her living form, or her remains. he would keep it for her, then, untouched. all that space would conjure her, if not her physical form, then an apparition: she might visit him in dreams, and tell him what had gone wrong, why she had left him. where did she exist if not on earth--was there such a place?--and did he want to know about it, if it existed? what was a place if not earthbound. his mind balked. he was giving her earth, to feed her in that place that was without it. an endless gift, a gesture that seemed right: and it need never be reciprocated, for it was a gift to himself as well, to be surrounded by land, by silence, and always--but how could this be, after so much time?--by the hope that she might step out of the trees, a woman now, but strangely the same, and reclaim her position in that place. 
 the land itself is family. there are other manifestations of this connection between people and nature. the nez perce deal in horses and one of the girls becomes enamored of these animals the way talmadge is bound to his orchard, seeing in the horses the same presence of a lost loved one that talmadge sees in his land. 
 coplin, whose parents owned orchards in the wenatchee county where her novel is set, knows of what she describes 
 in my family, which is somewhat nontraditional (some of us are related by blood, some not) there is a history of domestic violence, and sexual and substance abuse. when i was growing up, only some of this was known to me--i sensed it without understanding what it was--but what was immediately before me, what was right in front of my face was the immense beauty of the landscape--orchards, wheat fields, forests--and people who did not hurt me, but loved me very much and were affectionate and kind. these elements--a child's half knowledge of a painful family past, and sensitivity to the physical landscape--formed the book. 
 there is such sadness here. we feel with talmadge the loss of his sister, and it is hard not to choke up even when recalling this, long after having read the book. there is also the fire of hope that talmadge guards, nurtures, that offers light by which to steer his course. he travels a hard road to find what he wants, needs, to give what he can, what he must. you cannot read this book without coming to feel for this man, and to admire the skill, and clearly love, with which he has been crafted. 
 i thought of the old man and the sea, except in this case the fish the old man is trying to bring home is a lost soul of a young woman, who is in danger of being consumed before he can get her to port. coplin, though, says that her models were faulkner and toni morrison. i leave it to those better versed than i to go into detail on those comparisons. 
 there is beautiful mirroring in use here. talmadge is searching for some peace, denied him as a child, while the young woman he wants to help is searching for a peace of her own, so long denied her by the guilt she feels for a decision taken when she was still young. both talmadge and his charge keep their thoughts and feelings to themselves. a scene in which horses are broken reminds a runaway of how people were broken in her earlier experience. silences pervade in this remote place. talmadge's mother had preferred quiet to almost anything, and talmadge acquired the trait. clee, of course, does not actually speak at all, and we learn that elspeth had difficulty speaking as well. the two runaways also speak little. 
 there is an existential theme that permeates. where does one's self leave off and everything else begin? 
 there was no wilderness to lose oneself inside. she touched her face in the dark: she had her self. but then, she thought, her self was nothing. she was nothing. 
 later 
 a gentle wind, a kind of sighing, moved over the earth; and for a moment he felt as if his body had evaporated 
 and again 
 when she was alone, when she was working, it was as if she forgot about herself. it seemed strange to state it this way but it was as if she had no outline, no body, even though the work was very physical. where did her mind go? her mind was steeped in the task at hand. at such times she felt a depth of kinship with the earth... 
 there are events that take place towards the back end of this tale that some readers might find a bit of a stretch. would this person go that far to achieve the desired end? maybe, maybe not. but it did not detract from the whole for me. 
 the orchardist is not just a moving portrait of a remarkable man, but a look at how people relate to place. not so long ago, i walked with my youngest through a particular stretch of greenwich village recalling events from a lifetime ago. this happened here. that happened there. an event took place in that building on the corner that changed my life. this is where i first set eyes on... i did this and such there. i told her that these streets and buildings held ghosts that called to me, ""remember,"" connections i cannot imagine abandoning for another locale. i get this connection to land, even if my orchard consists of wood and concrete structures and city streets rather than sylvan swaths, and bears a spectral fruit that only i can consume. i imagine most of us have similar experiences, history and place entwined in memory, sealed in, and maybe emerging from a particular patch of earth. talmadge's attachment is probably much more intense than many of ours, but it will resonate, i expect, for most. the orchardist tells a sometimes harsh and more times beautiful story. you will care. definitely have some tissues at the ready. this is a great one and you will not want to miss it.

 re-read 2017 i had to read this book again for the new book next week. i love it so freaking much! this time i listened to it on audio from overdrive (it's now on my audible wishlist) the narrator, fiona hardingham did a wonderful job! 
 it was so nice to be back in lada's world. she's just so tough but i did feel sorry for her with the love interest but it's extremely complicated. she lets her guard down a little in that area but she's still a force. heh! that guy that tried to rape her, that didn't go as planned! i love it =]. anyway, you can see my old review for excerpts and fun stuff =] 
 ****older review**** 
 vlad dracul's heavy brow descended like a storm when the doctor informed him that his wife had given birth to a girl. 
 oh, little did he know that he would have one of the most brutal, bad@ssed girl known to man! 
 lada waved the knife at him in answer to the question she did not understand. vlad raised an eyebrow. he was wrapped in a fine cloak, an elaborate hat on his head. it had been nearly a year since lada had seen her father. she did not recognize him. 
 ""lada!"" the nurse whispered. ""come here at once."" 
 lada stood as tall as her short, stocky legs allowed. ""this is my home! i am the order of the dragon! i kill infidels!"" 
 i am totally in love with the character of ladislav dragwlya (lada). she is beyond bad. she just doesn't care and she will attack anyone. she wants to be equal with men. she doesn't care to be married off. she doesn't care to do women stuff. she trains to be a soldier, a warrior woman. she bad to the bone from the get go. 
 radu had braced for another blow when aron's shout made him open his eyes. aron was spinning in a circle, trying desperately to dislodge lada. she was not supposed to be here, but somehow her presence was unsurprising. she had jumped on the boy's back, clasping her arms around him and pinning his arms to his sides. radu could not see her face through her tangled drape of hair until aron twisted to the side, revealing lada's teeth sunk into his shoulder 
 i wish i could have been like her with all of the bullies in school :-) 
 radu is lada's younger brother, but she doesn't coddle him or give him comfort like a normal sister. she will take up for him but she will smack him around as well. although, when they get a little older she's not as bad to him. 
 i was thinking this was going to be a cool book about the awesome vlad and his kids but vlad is like a little sissy compared to his daughter lada. they sort of switched places. 
 this book took a lot of time building up to what i'm hoping is going to be an awesome saga. with that ending i do believe so. 
 vlad let halil pasha take lada and radu to the ottoman court. he turned them over to an enemy. although, he wasn't bad to the kids. he gave them schooling and decided to marry lada off when the time came. oh and that decision went down well, so she got sent off to another place with one of the sultan's sons to do more schooling with the son, mehmed and her brother radu. 
 lada spoke with a quiet, clear voice, and the room hushed in surprise. no one expected the girl to speak. she was probably not allowed to. radu knew lada would not care either way. ""on our wedding night,"" she said. ""i will cut out your tongue and swallow it. then both tongues that spoke our marriage vows will belong to me, and i will be wed only to myself. you will most likely choke to death on your own blood, which will be unfortunate, but i will be both husband and wife and therefore not a widow to be pitied. 
 there is no one like her. to be that brutal and not take no sh*t in those times is just beyond coolness! 
 lada eventually started training with the janissaries. they are a form of soldiers that are paid a good wage. she became friends with them when she didn't take crap from them either. she eventually got her wish of becoming one of them, but oh so much more. 
 ""not very pretty for a whore."" the soldier behind her tugged on a strand of her hair. she ducked under his arm, grabbing his wrist and twisting it behind his back to pin him. it was a trick she learned under the harsh tutelage of mircea and perfected by practicing on bogdan and radu. the soldier shouted angrily and tried to pull away, so she twisted harder, pushing up against the joint. he yelped in pain. 
 ""you are prettier than i."" she put more pressure on his arm. ""perhaps you could offer yourself as whore instead."" 
 she's amazing! 
 lada, mehmed and radu bond, as much as lada allows herself to bond. i really enjoyed all of that storyline. there are some love interests in the book but they don't really go too far with that because it's more about kicking arse and getting the story set up. 
 lada huffed, exasperated. ""very well. what exactly does a friend do?"" 
 ""i have never had one. i was hoping you would know."" 
 ""then you are even stupider than you look. radu is the one who makes friends. i am the one who makes people want to whip me."" 
 ""good. in the spirit of friendship, i must tell you that i am bitterly jealous of the time you spend in the janisssaries' company. i want you to stop training with them. 
 ""and, in the spirit of friendship, i must tell you that i do not care in the slightest about your petty jealousies. i am late for my training."" she hooked her foot behind mehmed's ankle, then slammed her shoulder into his, tripping him and throwing him to the ground. 
 at some point mehmed becomes sultan when his father just decides to retire. there is a whole other story line going on there too, but i don't want to give out spoilers on certain things. lada does end up saving a bunch of lives and there are more wars and what not. 
 either way, i loved this book. i love lada and i look forward to the rest of the books! please be good! 
 ""not dragwlya,"" she said. ""lada dracul. i am not longer the daughter of the dragon."" she lifted her chin, sights set on the horizon. ""i am the dragon.""

 paul bryant had really only just started driving back home, was still trying with his left hand to jam the seat belt buckle into its lock, and - multitasking like mad - he was thinking about how to review life after life, and probably getting too caught up in the various amusing ways it could be done, so that he simply didn't notice the car poking far too far out of the side street. when finally he did, he had to swerve like crazy, right into the oncoming traffic. what with his seatbelt not being properly secured and the 30 ton lorry, darkness fell rapidly.

 paul bryant had really only just started driving back home, was still trying with his left hand to jam the seat belt buckle into its lock, and - multitasking like mad - he was thinking about how to review life after life, but wasn't so caught up in the various amusing ways it could be done that he didn't notice the car poking far too far out of the side street. stupid boy racer! he thought as he made a violent emergency stop. when he did finally get home he parked as usual round the corner, got out of his car and was delighted to be confronted with one of the urban foxes which visited sherwood occasionally. such elegant raffish creatures. but there seemed to be something agitating this particular one. it was moving side to side and then turning right round in some distress. what was wrong with it? suddenly it lunged towards him, nipped him on the ankle and rushed away. he thought about the disturbing incident later that evening as he sat at his computer and began his review. but then he began to feel most peculiar. he suddenly hated all the people who had written sniffy reviews of life after life comparing it to groundhog day (as if - that may be a totally great movie but bill murray is aware of reliving his endless day, and ursula is not aware of reliving her life, and it's her whole life - it's not even groundhog life, please, don't get me started); but also his mouth was dripping saliva, he had a high temperature, he was sweating like crazy, and his hair was standing straight up. urgggghh.....he lapsed into a coma. darkness fell - again. 
 december 2013 
 paul saw the idiot boy racer trying to edge out of the side road and slowed down to let him out. why not? let him cause a fatal crash somewhere else. when he got home, as he opened the car door he was confronted with one of the urban foxes who visited sherwood occasionally. but this one looked a little strange. thinking it might possibly be rabid, he gave it a blare on the car horn and it ran off. later that evening, sat at his computer, he was trying to marshal his thoughts on kate atkinson's pitch-perfect contemplation of our little lives and their infinite forking paths (ursula's main problem was that she couldn't change the fact that she was born in 1910 - hitler was always waiting for her) and how this gimmicky pop-philosophical soft-science fiction not-quite-alt-hist novel morphs into a terrifying war story, one of the best descriptions of life during the blitz ever - but his thoughts were interrupted by the roar of a police helicopter. they fly around sherwood sometimes, always en route to st ann's, which is gangster territory. this one seemed to be right above his house. what a racket. suddenly, the noise stopped. peace! that was not such a good thing however, as the helicopter's engine had cut out and the helicopter was descending rapidly through his roof. darkness fell quite quickly. 
 december 2013 
 paul - didn't crash - wasn't bit by rabid fox - didn't have police helicopter fall on his house - made it to his computer in one piece and thought for a moment. yes. the review. how about this. 
 december 2013 two words. 
 thomas cresswell. 
 alright, of course there will be more words, i just needed to give you a proper motivation to grab this extraordinary book, and an obnoxiously yet damnably brilliant british boy seemed like a good idea. now that i have your attention, let's move on, shall we? 
 ""one taste of warm blood is never enough, miss wadsworth."" 
 jack the ripper. 
 the whitechapel murderer. leather apron. whatever you call him, he's still the same; a monster that lingered in the shadows, bathed in blood and gore and terrorized london with his brutality and depravity. there are numerous theories about his identity, but none of them was confirmed. and so, kerri maniscalco crafted her own tale. a tale of heroes and villains. 
 ""there's nothing better than a little danger dashed with some romance."" 
 audrey rose wadsworth was not a proper lady. she chose science over blind faith, and spent her afternoons cutting up dead bodies rather than taking her tea with actual proper ladies, discussing eligible bachelors and gowns. her dark curiosity was never satisfied, so she cut and stitched and cut and stitched, until one day the mutilated body of a prostitute shook her to the core. and it was not the last. assisted by an insufferable mortuary student, she made the solution of these horrible crimes her top priority, while her family was falling apart and jack the ripper was always one step ahead, solidifying his reign of terror. but sometimes answers can do more damage than good. 
 ""fear is a hungry beast. the more you feed it, the more it grows."" 
 stalking jack the ripper was macabre. gruesome. ghastly. 
 morbidly fascinating. 
 the descriptions could be so graphic, that bile rised up my throat. the ambience so eerie, i couldn't suppress my shivers. the mystery so tangible, my heart bet frantically in my chest. kerri maniscalco's palette contained gloomy colours, grey for the mist that covered london, black for the shadows that hid the ripper's work, mixed with crimson red, for all the blood that was spilled. and in the middle of this canvas of death were two young forensic students, a boy and a girl, whose skills and wit would make sherlock holmes and watson proud. 
 source 
 wadsworth. a girl determined to be both pretty and fierce, a girl that fought for what she wanted, sick of the stereotypes against women and eager to prove them wrong. and while i couldn't help but admire her for her spirit, i did get angry at her a couple of times. i should hate to be judgemental, but why why why was she so reckless and impulsive? when there is a serial killer on the loose, who targets women and his savagery is unprecedented, you don't leave your house late at night, lurking near the sight of the murders, based on the belief that he won't attack you. 
 cresswell. a rich young man, cold and distant when it comes to murders and corpses, but with a fire burning within him that awaits for the moment to be ignited. his replies are always witty and sarcastic, he is aware of his marvelous deduction skills and vast knowledge, and this makes him arrogant, but he is caring, and loyal, and i am so smitten it's ridiculous! 
 ""without lifting his head from his own journal, he said, ""not having any luck figuring me out, then? don't worry, you'll get better with practice. and, yes""--he grinned wickedly, eyes fixed on his paper--""you'll still fancy me tomorrow no matter how much you wish otherwise. i'm unpredictable, and you adore it. just as i cannot wrap my massive brain around the equation of you and yet adore it."" 
 get a spoon because i am a puddle of goo! wadsworth and cresswell are always bickering, driving each other crazy, and the attraction between them turns slowly into something deeper that does funny things to your stomach (which is pleasant after all the ugly things the body parts and fluids have done to said delicate stomach), while the tension sets you on fire! 
 ""i don't blame you, i am rather attractive. the tall, dark hero of your dreams, swooping in to save you with my vast intellect. you should accept my hand at once."" 
 stalking jack the ripper is a superb debut, and i am all too eager to read the next adventures of wadsworth and cresswell! great job, kerri maniscalco!

 the brain is locked in total darkness of course, children, says the voice. it floats in a clear liquid inside the skull, never in the light. and yet the world it constructs in the mind is full of light. it brims with color and movement. so how, children, does the brain, which lives without a spark of light, build for us a world full of light? 
 marie laure leblanc is a teen who had gone blind at age 6. she and her father, daniel, fled paris ahead of the german invasion, arriving in the ancient walled port city of saint malo in northwest france to stay with m-l's great uncle, etienne. his ptsd from ww i had kept him indoors for two decades. they bring with them a large and infamous diamond, to save it from the nazis. daniel had made a scale model of their neighborhood in paris to help young marie laure learn her away around, and repeats the project in saint malo, which is eventually occupied by the german army. 
 werner and jutta pfennig are raised in a german orphanage after their father is killed in the local mine. werner has a gift for electronics, and is sent to a special school where, despite the many horrors of the experience, his talent is nurtured. he develops technology for locating radio sources, and is rushed into the wehrmacht to apply his skill in the war. his assignment brings him to saint malo, where his path and marie laure's intersect. 
 anthony doerr 
 there are three primary time streams here, 1944 as the allies are assaulting the german-held town, 1940-44, as we follow the progress of werner and marie laure to their intersection, and the 1930s. we see the boy and the girl as children, and are presented with mirrored events in their young lives that will define in large measure the years to follow. werner and jutta are mesmerized by a french radio broadcast, a respite from the anti-semitic propaganda the government is broadcasting. the professor in the french broadcast offers lectures on science, and inspires werner to dream of a life beyond the orphanage. 
 open your eyes, concluded the man, and see what you can with them before they close forever, and then a piano comes on, playing a lonely song that sounds to werner like a golden boat traveling a dark river, a progression of harmonies that transfigures zollverein: the houses turned to mist, the mines filled in, the smokestacks fallen, an ancient sea spilling through the streets, and the air streaming with possibility. 
 as her father is the head locksmith for the national museum of natural history in paris, marie laure has the run of the place. she spends a lot of time with a professor there, learning everything she can about shells, mollusks and snails. 
 dr. geffard teaches her the names of shells--lambis lambis, cypraea moneta, lophiotoma acuta--and lets her feel the spines and apertures and whorls of each in turn. he explains the branches of marine evolution and the sequences of the geologic periods; on her best days, she glimpses the limitless span of millennia behind her: millions of years, tens of millions of years. 
 both werner and marie laure are enriched by teachers and books as they grow. no nuclear families here. marie laure's mother died in childbirth. the pfennig children lost their remaining parent when father was killed in the mine. 
 the author, in a video on his site, talks about the three pieces of inspiration that provided the superstructure for the novel. while 80 feet below ground in a nyc subway, a fellow passenger was griping about the loss of cell service. doerr appreciates the beautiful miracle that is modern communications. at the start of the book i wanted to try to capture the magic of hearing the voice of a stranger in a little device in your home because for the history of humanity, that was a strange thing. i started with a boy trapped somewhere and a girl reading a story. a year later he was on a book tour in france and saw saint malo for the first time. walking around this beautiful seaside town, a walled fortress, the beautiful channel, the green water of the channel breaking against the walls and i told my editor, ""look how old this is. this medieval town's so pretty."" he said, ""actually, this town was almost entirely destroyed in 1944, by your country, by american bombs."" so i started researching a lot about the city of saint malo immediately and knew that was the setting. that was where the boy would be trapped, listening to the radio. the third piece arrived when doerr learned that when the germans invaded, the french hid not only their artistic treasures but their important natural history and gemological holdings as well. 
 the story is told primarily in alternating marie laure's and werner's experiences. but there is a third stream as well, that of sgt major reinhold von rumpel, a gem appraiser drafted by the reich to examine the jewels captured by the military and collect the best for a special collection. he becomes obsessed with finding the sea of flames, the near mythic diamond daniel leblanc had hidden away. he is pretty much the prototypical evil nazi, completely corrupt, greedy, cruel, as close to a stick-figure characterization as there is in the book. but his evil-doing provides the danger needed to move the story forward. 
 there may not be words sufficient to exclaim just how magnificent an accomplishment this book is. amazing, spectacular, incredible, moving, engaging, emotional, gripping, celestial, soulful, and bloody fracking brilliant might give some indication. there is so much going on here. one can read it for the story alone and come away satisfied. but there is such amazing craft on display that the book rewards a closer reading. in addition to a deft application of mirroring in the experiences of werner and marie laure, doerr brings a poet's sense of imagery and magic. 
 marie-laure's sense of the world is filled with shell, snail, and mollusk experiences and references. some are simple. during a time of intense stress, she must live like the snails, moment to moment, centimeter to centimeter. in a moment of hopeful reflection, these tiny wet beings straining calcium from the water and spinning it into polished dreams on their backs--it is enough. more than enough. you will find many more scattered about like you-know-what on a beach. i knew early on that i wanted her to be interested in shells. i'm standing here at the ocean right now. i've always been so interested in both the visual beauty of mollusks and the tactile feel of them. as a kid, i collected them all the time. that really imbued both ""the shell collector"" and marie with, why does the natural world bother to be so beautiful? for me, that's really embodied in seashells. i knew early on that i wanted her to find a path to pursue her interest in shells. i think that fits -- i hope that fits -- with visual impairment, using your fingers to identify them and admire them. - from the powell's reviewwerner's snowy white hair alone might stand in for the entirety of the visible spectrum. (although it is described as ""a color that is the absence of color."") the dreaded prospect of being forced to work in the mines in a literally coal-black environment, the very antithesis of light, offers motivation for werner to find another path, and coal itself offers a balance for that other form of carbon that drives marie laure's father out of paris, the one that embodies light. while black and white are often used in describing werner's environment, the broader spectrum figures large in his descriptions. 
 werner liked to crouch in his dormer and imagine radio waves like mile-long harp strings, bending and vibrating over zollverein, flying through forests, through cities, through walls. at midnight he and jutta prowl the ionosphere, searching for that lavish, penetrating voice. when they find it, werner feels as if he has been launched into a different existence, a secret place where great discoveries are possible, where an orphan from a coal town can solve some vital mystery hidden in the physical world. 
 a nice additional touch is marie laure's reading of 20,000 leagues under the sea. it permeates the tale as her reading echoes events and tensions in the real world of the story. 
 also avian imagery is a frequent, soulful presence. a particularly moving moment is when a damaged character is reminded of a long-lost friend (or maybe a long-remembered fear?) by the presence of a particular bird associated with that friend and the time when they knew each other. 
 there are substantive issues addressed in this national book award finalist. moral choices must be made about how to respond when darkness seeks to extinguish the light. there are powerful instances in which different characters withdraw into their shells in response to evil, but others in which they rage against the night with their actions. thoughtful characters question the morality of their actions, as dark-siders plunge into the moral abyss. sometimes the plunge is steep and immediate, but for others it is made clear that innocence can be corrupted, bit by bit. the major characters, and a few of the secondary ones, are very well drawn. you will most definitely care what happens to them. 
 as for gripes, few and far between. there is a tendency at times to tell rather than show. marie laure may be too good. that's about it. there are sure to be some who find this story too emotional. i am not among them. 
 just as werner perceives or imagines he perceives an invisible world of radiowaves, all the light we cannot see enriches the reader with a spectrum of imagery, of meaning, of feeling. you may need eyes to read the page, ears to hear if listening to an audio version, or sensitive, educated fingers to read a braille volume (please tell me this book has been published in braille), but the waves with which doerr has constructed his masterwork will permeate your reading experience. they may not be entirely apparent to your senses the first time you read this book. they are there. whether you see, hear or touch them, or miss them entirely, they are there, and they will fill you. all the light we cannot see is a dazzling novel. when you read it, you will see.

 definitely check out doerr's site. and if you are wondering what he had in mind, specifically, with the title: it's a reference first and foremost to all the light we literally cannot see: that is, the wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum that are beyond the ability of human eyes to detect (radio waves, of course, being the most relevant). it's also a metaphorical suggestion that there are countless invisible stories still buried within world war ii -- that stories of ordinary children, for example, are a kind of light we do not typically see. ultimately, the title is intended as a suggestion that we spend too much time focused on only a small slice of the spectrum of possibility. - from doerr's siteinterview by jill owens for powell's

 i was split on erik larson's the devil in the white city because i found the half of the book about the 1893 chicago's world fair incredibly interesting but thought the other half about serial killer h.h. holmes to be just another true crime gore fest. then in thunderstruck he again gave us some nice pop history with the story of marconi and the invention of the radio, but then he stretched the inclusion of a crime story to a ridiculous exteme by trying to tie in a manhunt for a killer across the atlantic that used early wireless. 
 i was hoping that in the garden of beasts would allow larson to play to his strengths with a story about nazis in the 1930s because i thought he could give a detailed look at life in berlin as hitler was consolidating his power, and this time he'd actually have a legitimate horror story to tell without it feeling like something just tacked on to sell books. instead, i got a story about a couple of people who were surrounded by evil and didn't do a helluva lot about it. 
 the story centers on william dodd and his daughter martha. dodd was a history professor in chicago with minor political connections and a dream of obtaining a quiet government post somewhere so he could finish writing a history of the american civil war. when president roosevelt couldn't get anyone else to take the job, he asked dodd to be the ambassador to germany. dodd accepted and took his wife and two grown children along with him. like a lot of americans, dodd was worried about some of the stories of nazi violence coming out at the time, but thought that hitler might be nudged towards controlling the extreme factions since he'd just taken over as chancellor. his interactions with the nazi power brokers and the rise of german nationalistic fervor eventually convinced dodd that hitler and his people were bad news for the entire world. 
 here's where the book falls down for me. larson got me interested in the chicago world's fair because i knew nothing about it, and he made it come alive. i already know about how the nazis came to power so the history piece of this is old news to me. while there's some interesting slice of life details and larson does a nice job of giving you a sense of the weird combination of paranoia, pride, terror and zeal that pervaded germany in the 1930s, it's really nothing i haven't heard before. maybe i would have been more interested if i would have found dodd's story more intriguing, but frankly, the ambassador seemed about as interesting as a saltine cracker to me. 
 dodd comes across as a decent enough guy for his time. he did advocate policies of getting tougher with germany when most of america was in full isolationist mode, but aside from irking the nazis with a couple of speeches and boycotting a couple of official functions, he really didn't do anything. (and as one of his critics of the time pointed out, an ambassador who refuses to meet with the government of the country he's in really isn't accomplishing much.) dodd irritated others in america's diplomatic service with his constant criticism of their spending and seemed more concerned with cutting costs at the embassy rather than dealing with the germans. 
 the odd thing about this book is that larson all but ignores dodd's wife and son in favor of giving a detailed portrayal of his daughter, martha. martha came along with her father as her first marriage was ending, and to put it mildly, she got around. i mean, it's good that a woman in her time was sexually liberated enough to carry on with guys like the poet carl sandburg. however, once she dated the head of the gestapo and a top soviet spy as well as many, many others, i had the impression that martha was less than discriminating with her affections. hell, she even kinda went along with a half-assed scheme one of the nazis had to try and hook her up with hitler himself. 
 so this becomes the story of a mild mannered diplomat dealing with the rise of some of the most evil fucks in history, but he's pinching pennies at the embassy instead of giving visas to every jewish person he could find. and his daughter is a sleeping her way through europe while at first extolling the virtues of the nazis, then deciding that she's kind of a communist, but in the end martha doesn't do much but put a smile on the face of any guy who gives her a wink and a smile. 
 in this case, i knew the history and only got a story about a couple of people who seem like they should have been maybe a chapter in larger history of the time and place. dodd and martha just didn't impress or intrigue me enough to warrant reading a whole book about them. it's disappointing that larson decided to make them the center of this. i just started wolf hall, and i find the relentless use of ""he"" to be extremely irritating. in the first several chapters, there are dozens of instances where it is not clear who is speaking. every once in a while, as if recognizing the problem she has created, mantel uses the phrase ""he, cromwell."" why not just say cromwell? 
 unless there is some good reason which i can't imagine, this sort of obfuscation is just lazy writing which disrespects the reader. may i re-think that, based on a comment by another reader. it's not lazy writing. it's very purposeful. and very distracting. 
 ... later ... 
 i just read some of the amazon reviews. there are actually quite a few readers who found the ""he"" business as disconcerting as i did, and who expressed their displeasure in rather strong terms, along with many *-star ratings. however, many others really liked the book, as do many goodreads readers, so it must not bother them as it does me. 
 another goodreads reader suggested that the use of ""he"" all the time created a closer intimacy with cromwell. perhaps, but i see it differently. if you want to create intimacy, use the first person. then it is clear that everything is seen and felt by the single protagonist, and the reader can share that character's viewpoint, thoughts and feelings. what mantel has done is not to bring us close to cromwell, but to inject herself, the author, between the reader and the prime character. she does this on practically every page and i find it jarring every time it happens. 
 before my final negative notes, let me say that mantel clearly has an exquisite command of the language. even in the few chapters i read, her elegant choice of words often made me reflect and smile. she can paint a picture when describing a character or a setting that is truly wonderful. and, when she chooses to do so, she writes a vivid scene that has power and emotion. 
 such continuity of story, however, is the exception rather than the rule. the constant switching of time and place, often without the merest hint of transition, made the reading much more difficult than it had to be. just a word here or there would have made a huge difference. 
 finally, the breezy style in which much of the book is written is entertaining, as many have noted and i agree, but it had the effect of making me wonder if mantel was as true to the history as i think a historical fiction should be. of course the dialogue and many of the personal incidents are made up, but does the author, when portraying actual events, present them accurately? i think such concern for the truth is an obligation of an author when writing about historical characters and events. mantel left me unsure. 
 i think i've had enough of wolf hall, and perhaps other goodreads readers have had enough of my criticism of what is surely a popular book. i don't usually write negative opinions, but this book just seemed to drag them out of me. i hope i have not offended anyone. london, late april 1812: a month that had seen violent civil unrest, savage battles on the continent, and the rumblings of aggression from the new american nation. it was also the month in which queen charlotte--after a two-year hiatus--returned to the practice of holding drawing rooms for the presentation of young ladies into high society. a battleground of a different kind. 
 my goodness, this book was delightful! 
 it's got everything i like! historical romance? check! magic? check! murder?! check!!!!!! that's not to say that something with all of these elements is bound to be good, because clearly other books with fantastic elements have gone awfully, terribly wrong, but this book did it just right. and boy was it fun to read. 
 young lady helen is about to make her debut in society - presented to the queen, no less, when people start disappearing. as a young noblewoman, people expect her to say ""ain't nobody got time for that!"" helen, being the intelligent girl that she is, decides to not leave it be and actually figure out wtf is going on. otherwise we wouldn't have a book, now, would we?! 
 interspersed between the normal regency stuff like balls (almack's!) and manners and possibilities of ruining one's prospects is the mystery of helen's parents, and the strange things that are happening to her. helen is a great character. she behaves as befitting a young lady of her era, and despite the book's blurb of will her intelligence and headstrong curiosity wind up leading them into a death trap, i did not find her tstl in the least. 
 the problem i have with most regency novels is that the main female character often mistakes bitchiness for independence. no such problems with this book. helen knows when to keep her head down, to keep quiet when necessary, but she is most definitely not without a sense of humor. 
 ""but look, at least twenty-five frogs on the bodice alone. is it too much to ask for a dress that won't scare the horse?"" 
 aunt leonore gave her loud cackle--the one that had earned her the title lady laugh amongst her friends and lady hee-haw amongst her enemies. ""not this season, my dear. it is all military flimflam."" 
 ""bonaparte has a lot to answer for,"" helen said. ""first europe, and now our fashion."" she flipped the magazine closed and rested it on her lap. 
 ""you really do have your mother's grim sense of humor."" 
 there is a wonderful friendship between helen and her maid. the actions between helen's secret investigation and her normal life as lady helen felt natural, as are her natural doubts and fears between choosing between the life she was born to, and the life she could choose. and again, contrary to what the book blurb says, the romance is barely there. 
 i have read alyson goodman's excellent eon series before, and i'm so happy to say that she's done it again with this one. 4.5/5 so sorry, i am not worthy of the honor of reviewing this novel. if however, my lord insists it, then i shall endeavor to offer up some humble thoughts regarding its mighty, even epic narrative. neh? the scope is so vast, the characters and settings are so many, the head is liable to spin at times, so sorry. but the arc it follows is like a peregrine's path through the sky: long but fast and with vicious twists along what might otherwise have seemed a predictable path. i'm sure my lord would agree that parts of the story can become quite tedious. i am not speaking of the slow-to-develop romance between mariko and the anjin-san nor even of the dueling political machinations of toranaga and ishido. no, sire. this humble vassal speaks more to the text and how japanese is interwoven with the barbarian words in so many places. and then how barbarian words come even to replace japanese! or barbarian words standing in for the words of other barbarian tongues! if you'll excuse this vassal's petulant tongue, sire, it's enough to make one fart dust, so sorry. but these tedious affectations do blend in after a while, neh? and the narrative is quite the enjoyable one -- full of so much intrigue and humor. a rousing and enjoyable tale of which i am not worthy to comment further. please, i cannot live with this shame. please allow me to commit seppuku at once. i did not hate this book (hate would be too strong a word, and i can't hate it because i applaud the fact that ken follett attempted to write an epic novel). but i did not like it. i didn't like it from the start; his writing style hit me like a brick, but jim thoroughly enjoyed the book that i kept trying to convince myself that i ought to give it a chance, hoping it would get better. when i was about 500 pages in, he saw how miserable i was and asked why i didn't just stop reading it, but at that point, i was invested in it; i had spent all that time getting that far, that i needed to finish it, and i couldn't wait to come to the end. i kept counting down: ""only 450 pages left; only 300 to go; last 200 pages...yay, i have 50 pages left!"" those fifty pages were the toughest to get through. by the time i was at the end, i thought it was a wasted effort - both on his part and mine. 
 it's so much easier to explicate on what i did not like because there were so many things: 
 - i loathed the writing style (he vacillated between pages and pages of highly complex architectural discourses to third-grade level simple sentences grouped into short paragraphs). sometimes it was bearable. other times, i wanted to pull my hair out. there were times when i felt the only time he came alive as an author was when he was discussing architecture, but these parts were so didactic in nature that it couldn't hold my interest for long periods of time. 
 - i did not like the author's narrative style. he had to tie everything together (causality was so prevalent throughout the text that i wondered how he didn't work in how the killing of a fly affected events 60 years later). every single storyline was wrapped up - too neatly for my liking, in some cases. everyone was tied to someone else (it was like playing six degrees); every single character had to have a denouement; every little plot twist had to be explained; closure had to be achieved, no matter how preposterous the circumstances, over time and space. 
 - the characterization was poor. in fact, it was appalling how two-dimensional these characters were. good people were good. bad people were loathsome. as time went on, the good were always suffering one thing or another; they were put upon; they were harrassed; they were constantly challenged and put to the test like job (something follett actually used as a sermon!). the badfolk became more oppressive over time; they were not only detestable, but they had absolutely no redeeming qualities. and to go with a typical medieval stereotype, the good were always excessively beautiful, honorable, intelligent (geniuses or savants, even!) - and if they weren't rich, they would be at the end (i half expected havelok the dane and his refrigerator mouth to pop up somewhere, proving once and for all that in the medieval period, to be good was to have the purest light shining out of your mouth each time you opened it). nevertheless, the bad became uglier, became more despotic, scheming throughout life to get the better of their enemies (the goodfolk). but in the end, good always triumphed over evil; those who could, repented and were forgiven. those who couldn't, were killed off somehow, because apparently, death is the only way an evil person gets his (or her) dues. and then everyone had a happy ending. i hate happy endings when they're so obviously contrived. and this work was so elaborately, exhaustively, thoroughly contrived. (maybe it's not too late for me to change my mind and say i hated it. *grin*) 
 - historically speaking, there was so much left to be desired. granted, this novel was written two decades ago, and there have been new discoveries about the medieval period since follett started his research. but he got it all wrong anyhow. his idea of medieval life was so...off, that it hurt my head to continue reading sometimes. i had to pause periodically and rant to jim about what i currently found off-putting (for example, there weren't many literate people at the time; at the time this novel was set, there was still a distinct divide between england and wales; reading and writing were two separate skill sets, and people who knew how to read did not necessarily know how to write and vice versa; orality was a prevalent part of storytelling back then and books not so much and yet somehow, he conflated much of both; manuscript writing was either orally dictated or copied tediously by the monks - his concept of a scriptorium was incomplete, defective - and there has been so much written about this that it saddened me; he used modern translations of medieval poetical/verse works and couldn't explain even alliterative verse form effectively - i even wonder if he knew what it was; his understanding of the languages of the period - old english, middle english, latin, norman french, old french, middle french, etc. - and what was spoken by the aristocrats vs. the peasants vs. the growing middle classes disgusts me; he showed a lack of understanding of medieval law, medieval rights, the social classes, gender roles, even the tales and legends of the period, in both england and france; priests were quite low on the totem pole, in terms of the religious hierarchy, and were quite disparaged yet somehow, that didn't quite come across in this novel...i could go on and on, but i won't). 
 and the historical part of the novel i just found lacking. there are enough histories and chronicles, contemporaneously written, of the time, that he did not have to deviate much from history. there is so much written about the period between the death of henry i through the civil wars between the empress matilda and king stephen, to the time that henry ii ascended the throne (including the martyrdom of thomas a beckett), that i don't quite understand how he couldn't have mined the chronicles for better material. i understand that this is why it's called historical fiction, and that there will always be some element of fiction interspersed with historical fact. but the fictional aspects usually have to do with surrounding characters and situations that bolster the history. the fiction is not necessarily to the history itself. many times, when writing historical fiction, the author has to beware the pitfalls of creating a revisionist retelling, interspersing his or her own ideals or beliefs of what should have been to what was. if this novel had been marketed as a revisionary narrative, it would have been okay. but it wasn't. i'm just glad that the historical aspect of the novel just served as the background and not the real story. because then, i probably would've stopped reading. 
 the premise was a good one and held a lot of promise. it could've been a great historical epic had it been handled by a more assured writer. by someone who was more of a visionary, someone who had the patience to do exhaustive research or who knew how to craft richly developed characters. it needed an author who understood the epic genre, who knew how to mold the epic, who knew how to keep the narrative going, seemlessly binding time with narration and the human condition, without resorting to stereotypes and grating drama. and most importantly, it needed someone who understood when the story had been told; that while there will always be other stories to tell, that each book has its own natural end, and that these stories may not belong in this book. 
 ken follett may be a bestselling author of suspense novels (and even historical fiction such as pillars of the earth and world without end), but he is no writer of epics. compared to writers of historical fiction such as edward rutherford, james michener, bernard cornwell or margaret george, ken follett has a long way to go. outlander is not a book for everyone. i'll put that right out there. if you think you can stomach extreme sexual violence as well as themes of sadism then go ahead. if you can understand good characters doing things in their historical context that would be seen as abuse now, then give it a try. 
 you won't be disappointed. 
 gabaldon has finely crafted a novel that is radically different to the stereotype. this is no average love story. her research is extensive and flawless; bringing to life a world that is rich and dynamic in detail and character. 
 her prose a beautiful and well constructed and the characters. where do i even start with the characters? they have depth. they're lovable. they're real. 
 the problem with this book lies in two aspects: 
 it's pacing. it's fantastic, non-stop drama and action right up to the last 200 pages or so where it trickles down to a grinding halt. the other problem with it is that many people are going to be uncomfortable with some of the things that happen in the book. remembering the time difference and the culture that the male protagonist comes from is often hard when we judge his actions by today's standards. 
 but to readers who can over look these things, i highly recommend it as a book that is both incredibly well written, enjoyable and addictive. beautiful book. we've all been wrong on this whole rainforest issue. we don't need to save the rainforest. we need to destroy the rainforest. immediately. 
 i knew that the amazon was a hostile environment, but i was really shocked at the variety of horrific ways that the jungle will kill a person. you've got your standard malaria and yellow fever. then there's the piranha, the electric eels, the anacondas, the coral snakes or the poisonous toads that are so toxic that one of them could kill a hundred people. still not convinced? how about the tiny fish that will swim into any orifice and proceed to do things so terrible that sometimes men had to be castrated to survive. 
 that's not even talking about the bugs. sure, the mosquitoes spread disease, but there's also a variety of maggot that will infect living tissue. ants that can eat your clothes in a single night. chiggers that eat human tissue. cyanide squirting millipedes. parasitic worms that cause blindness. bugs that plant larvae under the skin where it will hatch later. 'kissing bugs' that bite the lips but the victim doesn't die until 20 years later when their brain or heart swells. 
 even if that doesn't kill you, you'd probably starve to death in what is described as a counterfeit paradise. because even though there's all kinds of plants and animals, good luck finding anything edible. avoid the animals, the disease, the bugs, injury, and starving to death, and you're still screwed when hostile natives catch you, eat you and use your skull as their favorite coffee mug. 
 to hell with the amazon. burn or bulldoze all of it and sow the earth with salt. that treacherous hellhole has to be obliterated before it can spread. and i don't want to hear about global warming or any nonsense about generating most of the world's oxygen. we can breathe shallow, people! 
 old percy fawcett was a veteran explorer who mounted several expeditions into the amazon and somehow managed to escape with his life. but he got obsessed with finding the mythical ruins of an el dorado-type city and led his son and another poor bastard to some kind of gruesome deaths. the mystery of what happened to him led to countless deaths from other dumb asses trekking into the jungle to look for them. 
 the guy who wrote the book knew all this and he was still stupid enough to go in there. he somehow lived through it, but i think the message is clear. stay out! first, i should mention that i listened to this one on audiobook. didn't read the text version. 
 second, the audio version is read by the author. i think jenny did a nice job with it, too. if you're used to nothing but professional audiobook narrators, there might be a few verbal ticks in here that might bug you. but me? for an autobiographical work like this? i'd much rather hear it in the author's own voice. 
 third, she got some actual laughs out of me. not just amusement or smiles. not just chuckles. real laughs. i was driving around in my car, alone, laughing like a madman. 
 fourth, several times i sat in the car after i'd finished whatever trip i was taking just to continue listening to the audiobook. 
 fifth, driving around, listening to this audiobook, i missed the proper turnoff several times. i didn't mind much, because turning around and driving back the right way gave me more time to listen to the book. 
 sixth, she made me cry reading this. three times. now admittedly, i seem to be rather soppy lately. but even given my recent emotional fragility, that's a mark of good writing some good writing. 
 seventh, the stories jenny lawson tells are, in turns: crushingly honest, funny, witty, sweet, heartbreaking, and delightfully bizarre. 
 lastly, i'd like to say that while i've read some of jenny's blog, and i know of her considerably fame as the bloggess, i didn't pick this book up because i was a fan. i bought this audiobook audio because i like her, and i've heard people say good things about it. 
 after listening to it? yeah. now i'm a fan. the short 
 actual rating: 4.5* 
 perfect for fans of: the diviners by libba bray, a study in charlotte by brittany cavallaro, long may she reign by rhiannon thomas, daughter of the burning city by amanda foody (or if you've already read this and enjoyed it, you might like these!) 
 writing: 4.5 stars

 the long 
 this was sooo good! i had heard such great things about this book, but knowing how mysteries are hit or miss with me, i was extremely skeptical. 
 what i expected: 
 a romance heavy mystery where i would be able to tell who was the culprit after one chapter (at most). 
 what i got: 
 a scientific approach to the infamous whodunnit' story of jack the ripper, featuring a strong heroine with a deep dedication to her forensic studies, constantly challenging what society deems is proper. (with just the right amount of romance, of course!) 
 i listened to the audiobook, which was awesome (i've already started the 2nd one). despite the fact that i went the audiobook route, i still looked at the photos scattered throughout the story. they really enhanced the reading experience, making it feel like i was gathering bits of evidence alongside audrey rose as the story goes on. 
 the forensics that went into this story are where i believe it really stands out. as previously mentioned, i'm not a huge mystery fan so i don't have much authority on the matter, but this was one of the most unique ya mysteries i've ever read. you can tell the author took care not only to research her subject, jack the ripper, but also the nature of forensics as a whole. the anatomical descriptions painted grotesque pictures in my mind, bringing the victims mutilated state to life (please forgive the terrible pun but i am weak willed in the face of bad jokes). 
 audrey rose's position as a young woman in the victorian era was an important aspect of the story as well. as a proper high society female, she is constantly underestimated and disrespected but she does not let circumstances limit her. she constantly questions why she, as a female, isn't thought to be as capable as her male counterparts and as such, always strives to prove said counterparts wrong. this isn't necessarily uncommon in ya, but this case was unique because it was a situation of the female outwitting her opponents not in a battle or political sense, but rather in terms of her intelligence, scientifically. her fight to be able to be educated in her uncle's classroom shows how important knowledge is to her and she proves, time and time again, that it is her most lethal weapon. 
 the murder mystery kept me guessing the whole time. i'm not terribly good at figuring out whodunnit' mysteries, so keep that in mind, but i felt like the twists and turns this story took were not easily anticipated. if i have one complaint, it's that it dragged a tiny bit at points. but it wasn't unbearably so. this kept me on the edge of my seat and made for a perfectly spooky halloween read. if you're looking for a good book to pick up this october, give this one a chance, i think it will surprise you! yes really. i almost gave this two stars, except it includes george clooney and that would be a crime. 
 this book is fine. it didn't charm me. it actually took me about three or four days to read 288 pages, which is funny because a lot of those pages don't include any actual words (she's got a ton of photocopies and inspirational signs intermixed with the text). it just wasn't as fun to read as i anticipated. 
 the problem is that she spends most of the book talking about how hard it is to write a book, or how she struggles with her self perception, or how she doesn't like people knowing her business. (incidentally, i think self-perception is an extremely valuable topic for women and teenagers, but perhaps not what i was interested in reading when i picked this up.) sometimes she's able to turn the ""i don't actually want to tell you anything about myself"" into a pretty funny chapter, like when she writes out the descriptions of divorce self-help books she'd like to write. (spoiler alert: she doesn't want to talk about her relationship with will arnett at all, which is certainly her right.) 
 but this means that she skips over many of the periods of her life that i was most interested in, like the founding of ucb and her subsequent success. she goes through a lot of, ""then we got a bigger theater, and then a bigger one, and then i was hired at snl."" for most of the book, i felt like she was skipping over the truly interesting side stories. there are some anecdotes from snl and parks and rec, but there are surprisingly few given how much time she's spent on both shows. 
 then again, back to george clooney: 
 on the day of the awards i simply asked george clooney's people to check and make sure george was okay with my sitting next to him at some point during the broadcast. ""of course!"" said george's people, after not asking him. i knew enough not to ask them to check with george and see if it was okay to sit on his lap. this was a request better saved for the last minute and in person. or better yet, when the time came, i would just sit on his lap without even asking. as the old saying goes, ""don't ask for permission to sit on george clooney's lap, beg for forgiveness once you do."" 
 so i sat on george's lap, and ever the pro, george asked me what kind of bit i was cooking up. i told him when they cut to me in the audience after announcing my nomination for best comedy actress i was going to act totally engrossed in talking to him. i told him i thought it would be funny if we were just flirting and laughing. he understood immediately and handed me a glass of champagne. i told him if i won there was a very good chance i would kiss him hard on the mouth. he responded, ""that's not a bad sunday."" as the camera cut to me he whispered in my ear, ""the thing about making movies is ..."" 
 perhaps if i'd listened to this as an audiobook, i might have enjoyed it more. when i went back to read some sentences over and consciously tried to hear her voice, i definitely thought some of it was funnier. but overall, i vacillated between two and three stars, and landed on three only because this is amy poehler's book. yes, really. i'll be honest here. it's really rare that i get through a book over 500 pages, let alone 700 (nook pages). it's also true that i have never read a single thing from mr. king until now. why? i'm not sure. maybe his books intimidated me, because when i was younger everyone was always talking to me about how his books were so long, and blah blah. anyway, i am proud to say that 11/22/63 was my first book read by stephen king. i hear it's so much different than his other work, but i also haven't met a single person that didn't love it. i read this book because everybody and their brother was recommending it to me as a ""must read"". i'm also not a big historical fiction fan, and didn't know how much i would enjoy reading about 20 years before my birth. i had nothing to worry about. 
 here is a book that you never want to end, yet you do want it to end, because you need to know what is going to happen. king introduces us to a man named jake who insists that he is not emotionless despite the fact that he doesn't cry often. i can relate to him right off the bat. not a big crier, but i definitely feel emotions on a huge level. jake is sent back to 1963 with a plan made up by a guy named al who owns a local diner, and has the ""rabbit hole"" which is how they travel back in time. at first his mission is just to stop lee harvey oswald from assassinating jfk, but then little things pop up here and there making him consider a few new things that need to be changed. i'm not going into any more detail than that, because i don't want to give away one single thing in this brilliant novel. fans of his story ""it"" may be excited to know he revisits the town of derry, maine, where ""it"" was located. 
 the excitement and suspense in this book were astonishing. i held my breath in anticipation of certain things jake had to do, and then some twist would come out of left field, and i would continue reading in awe. there were also several sighs of relief and a couple of cute moments involving jake's romance that just made me say ""aww"". 
 i do feel like there were a rough 100ish pages that dragged on somewhere in the middle, and the book may have benefited by taking out a few things, but obviously i'm no expert. that's just my opinion. again, this may have also been just something i was feeling, because i was very impatient and really wanting to know how this book would end. some people didn't like the ending, but i loved it! 
 in the afterword king discusses his research a bit. you can most definitely tell that a lot of research and thought went into this novel. the descriptions are vivid and when i say you are really transported back to the 60's i mean it. you will feel it. 
 11/22/63 is a truly memorable, wonderfully written book that i have already recommended to several family members and friends, and i will continue to recommend for years to come. this is another of king's books that i could see as a film, too. if you are wanting to try a stephen king book, but don't know if you will like all the horror, read this! it is not like that at all. gosh this book made me feel a lot of feels that were both sad, happy, mournful, exhilarating & thoughtful. it was both captivating and empowering to read this novel. although it was slow in the middle, during the last 50 pages i didn't want it to end. i would love to see a novella about daniel & gretchen 20 years in the future since there are some loose ends (like their families and friends lives) i want clarified since i'm really curious. 4.25/5 stars, loved this book just like i did the first!"," quick question: if this book has a quarter of a million ratings and still maintains an average rating of 413 why the hell are the most popular reviews the snarky mean spirited one or two star reviews that doesn't match up at all with what i'd assume would be the case which is that most people who read this book loved it including me 
 please people if you enjoy a book click ""like"" on the good reviews as well that's what people see first when they look for reviews on goodreadsthe ones with the most popularity or ""likes"" sad that this amazing book's two most populare (and therefore most visible) reviews are not in keeping with most people's thoughts

 summary: 
 claire is happily married she and her husband are visiting scotland and soaking up the history while indulging in some much needed time alone one morning they are witness to a group of women performing a ritual at a nearby stone circle 
 ""they should have been ridiculous and perhaps they were a collection of women in bedsheets many of them stout and far from agile parading in circles on top of a hill but the hair prickled on the back of my neck at the sound of their call 
 (the modern witches at the stone circlespooky and oh such a good mood setter) 
 claire returns to the circle later i wonder if she felt called to that magical place as if fate had plans for her and she was simply following her destiny 
 the tallest stone of the circle was cleft with a vertical split dividing the two massive pieces"" 
 without warning and for no apparent reason claire is whisked back to the year 1743 
 i could say that my field of vision contracted to a single dark spot then disappeared altogether leaving not darkness but a bright void i could say that i felt as though i were spinning or as though i were being pulled inside out all these things are true yet none of them conveys the sense i had of complete disruption of being slammed very had against something that wasn't there"" 
 there she meets james fraser a man who is as complex as their relationship turns out to be claire never stops trying to get back home but this world of the past and her present is slowly beginning to sink into her she must now decide between remaining faithful to a man she may never see again or conceding to the realization that she will forever remain in this time with this fascinating man who has become her fiercest protector 
 ~`*`~`*`~`*`~`*`~`*`~`*`~`*`~`*`~`*`~`*`~ 
 it's pure craziness to me how this book can be summed up in a couple of paragraphs and it's both detrimental and beneficial that a summary simply cannot encompass the sheer scope of heart that is in these pages i was absolutely unprepared 
 why detrimental because the details did become tedious even as they were adding to the story the downtimeinstead of a time of building anticipation became a time of hurry up and wait this is the only reason that i can't give this five starsbecause for a couple hundred pages i was 'a wee bit' bored and i hope that my saying this won't keep someone from reading it i wish that i didn't have to mention it but in order to be fair and honest i feel like it's necessary if only to keep someone's expectations from becoming too high 
 and to be totally confusing it's the details that drag you down into the middle of the eighteenth century the minor secondary plots that make you live this life for awhile so i'm not certain that they weren't necessary i do wish that we got more of claire dealing with the mundane things but she just never seems bothered enough with inconveniences to mention them 
 i don't want to do much of a character breakdown except for maybe the three big key players in this story 
 ~`*`~`*`~`*`~`*`~`*`~`*`~`*`~`*`~`*`~`*`~ 
 claire 
 ""you're no verra sensible sassenach but i like ye fine"" 
 oh boy i had heard that a lot of people didn't like claire at first and to be quite honest for most of the book i really did like her she was fairly steadfast to her husbandalthough circumstances bieng what they were it would have been nearly impossible for her to stay that way this was a fascinating look into what it must have been like for a woman back in those times not quite the dark ages but boy they were a far cry from modern women's rights this was a time of witch burnings and mob mentality imagine what it would be like to go back to these times knowing what we know now remembering what took place in history and being scared to death to be female you're completely at the mercy of the men you are with thank goodness claire stumbled upon jamie 
 her character did fluctuate for me for obvious reasons i had a few minor hiccups with how wishy washy she was at times and how little she seemed to think about how her actions would affect jamie however i do think that she had no idea how passionately jamie felt for her until near the very end so why would she feel the need to constantly spare his feelings and put him first at some point she has to think of herself the time frame in which all of this happens is not exactly conducive to accepting her fate and giving up on her whole life before scotland so i felt like i could cut her a break she has an awful lot to deal with and i feel like she did the best she could and toward the endshe becomes just as much a hero as jamie does you just have to wait for her to build up to this amazing person that she was meant to be 
 ~`*`~`*`~`*`~`*`~`*`~`*`~`*`~`*`~`*`~`*`~ 
 jamie 
 yes i swooned i gushed i loooooooved jamie fraser who wouldn't who would admit to it if they didn't however he is really not at all what i expected i like the badass boys the heroes the heartbreakers those men who make you wonder if they will ever be tamed i like men on the edge of good and evil the ones that you are always unsure of but there's just something about the nice guy the man whoas soon as you meet him you know his heart is pure and good there are no questions with regards to jamie about his purity of character he's the epitome of good he's a great mix of beta male (somewhat in the background not horribly outspoken usually backup for the leaders) and alpha male (leader loud and proud tends to be bossy and pushy) i expected jamie to be a more stand out guy but honestly it was all in the ""knowing"" of jamie that made me fall for him he is one of the most honorable strong minded tender loyal and devoted fictional men i've ever ever read about as jamie himself puts it he ""i havena the taste for power at the cost of other men's blood"" all of these romance heroes that we read aboutthe dukes and lords and lairds and suchall of the battles and death and heartachethey're entitled to their place in society to revel in their own sense of power and self-righteousness jamie just wants peace a home his wife and a good life simple but so powerful if only more people felt that way if only more men were heroes because of the battles they didn't fight 
 claire tending to jamie's shoulder 
 ""ye need not be scairt of me"" he said softly ""nor of anyone here so long as i'm with ye"" 
 that is not to say that he was perfect one big huge point of contention for me was when he beats claire after she tries to find the stone circle and instead ends up getting captured i don't care what year it is that's never right to beat her until she can't sleep can't sit down and then allow his men to make fun of her for days afterward while she is healing this is one of the more cruel things that i've ever forgiven a hero for i suppose if i'm going to forgive it may as well be james alexander malcolm mackenzie fraser

 randall 
 i truly think that he is not only one of the most vile heartless disgusting noxious evil villains that i've ever met he is also oddly an object of pity not to be mistaken for sympathy he deserves a slow torturous endless agonizing death his singleminded foxhunt of jamie is confusing at first and later every time his name is mentioned i literally became filled with rage i'm one of those that cried when i'm angry and i can't even tell you how hard i cried enough that i couldn't read any more i had to calm down first 
 poor jamie :( 
 here is my reaction of which i typed in the buddy read i was taking part in after i read the specific part that made me hateliterally hate randall do not read this if you don't want a huge spoiler you've been warned82% 
 son of a fucking bitch not only did jamie get raped but we don't even get to see that evil sadistic ass hole suffer i'm so mad right now so fucking mad and what the hell was all the wolf bullshit why even put that in there it has no bearing on the story except to draw out the part where jamie is once again floggedtortured burned beat raped so i say againwhat the fuck i'm a vindictive bitch i want payback that fucker needs to suffer jamie needs to look him in the eye while he guts him how fucking anticlimactic to give him an easy out i am just livid i'm so pissed off i'm crying 
 yeah suffice it to say that i really hope we get more of randall and that ms gabaldon feels the black rage that i felt toward him i hope i hope i hope even rereading my reaction makes my blood pressure rise 
 final thoughts: 
 yes this is a great historical fiction novel but jamie and clairetheir love their devotion to each other is what makes this story epic you just can't get around that fact this is a love story and so much more i was so conflicted from the position that both claire and jaime were put in what is right and wrong here claire loves her husband but here she is in this impossible situation of which she can confide in no one not a single person and so she goes first with her gut then with her head and finally finally with her heart 
 ""does it ever stop claire the wanting"" 
 ""you're mine mo duinne"" he said softly pressing himself into my depths ""mine alone now and forever mine whether ye will it or no"" i pulled against his grip and sucked in my breath with a faint ""ah"" as he pressed even deeper 
 ""aye i mean to use ye hard my sassenach"" he whispered ""i want to own you to possess you body and soul"" i struggled slightly and he pressed me down hammering me a solid inexorable pounding that reached my womb with each stroke ""i mean to make ye call me 'master"" sassenach"" his soft voice was a threat of revenge for the agonies of the last minutes ""i mean to make you mine"" 
 and later 
 ""oh aye sassenachi am your masterand you're mine seems i canna possess your soul without losing my own"" 
 with the gorgeous backdrop of scotland the descriptions alone and the way the dialogue forces you to sink into the setting is worth the entire read 
 i'm beyond happy that i finally started this series i'm trying to pace myself while reading the next stories as i feel the greatness in ma bones this book itself was so amazing i can't imagine what's in store for me there were a few hintsvery very tiny hints in this book of some strange happenings with regards to the time travel aspect things always get convoluted when it comes to the whole switching time thing what came first claire in real time or claire in 1743 what will she change by going back and messing around with her ancestors or more so her husband's ancestors i can't wait to find out i put off reading this book for the library book club here are my three reasons for doing so: 
 1) it's a young adult book i am an adult it can't be that good if it's written for young people 
 2) it's about the holocaust and i think we've all heard enough about that the author will probably even focus on colors among the grays as in ""schindler's list"" 
 3) i have way too many other books to read 
 after avoiding the book for as long as possible i sat down hoping to enjoy it enough to gain some clever comments for the book group 
 turns out most of my concerns were right but one other thing was also true: this book rocks 
 the first thing any review will say about this book is that it is narrated by death so i might as well get it out of the way death the hooded one the angel of the night narrates he is very busy during the war years as you might expect some people claim this is a mere gimmick and that the story is strong enough as it is 
 i agree that this is a strong story-- it moves like a sailboat on a brisk day-- but i think the choice to tell it through death was a good one death foreshadows constantly so we know a bit about which of the characters will die instead of ruining the shock value this heightened my anticipation and dread and isn't that how people feel during war they know some of them are bound to die they know they will lose loved ones it's one long hellish wait to see how it will turn out 
 it's also an unusual take on the holocaust because it focuses on liesel an orphaned german girl living in hitler's birthplace liesel (the book thief) and the other characters in this book are rich interesting and wily i say wily because at points in the book you hate them but they change and you grow to love them for instance liesel's adopted mother is a foul-mouthed abusive sharp woman (spoiler--->) when liesel's adopted father is shipped off to war however liesel creeps through the house to see rosa sleeping with her husband's accordian strapped around her waist rosa's changes prove one of the greatest reasons to read good literature-- to get insight into the type of people we don't usually give a second chance i could bang mr rochester like a screen door 'till next tuesday that's not all i got from this book honestly whatttt how did i not mark this magnificent creation of a novel as read before 
 i read this book 2 years ago and it has captured my heart and is my favorite book of all time <3 i'm sure this is going to mark me as a literary dud but for all the brilliant reviews of this book i couldn't really get into it 
 the book revolves around marie-laure a blind girl who lives with her father her father is the locksmith at the paris museum of natural history and marie is raised wholly in the museum and at home marie has a semi-idyllic childhood until the nazi's invade paris and she and her father have to flee to another city where a reclusive uncle lives unknown to marie her father is smuggling the world's most priceless jewel out of the city on behalf of the museum unfortunately for them a german soldier is hot on the trail of the jewel and will go to extreme lengths to find it 
 werner is a german orphan who teaches himself everything to do with radios; after repairing a senior-ranking german officer's radio he is given entry into a youth academy that trains young soldiers for hitler's army he is then drafted to utilize his skills to find resistance armies who are using the radio - but werner is no soldier and soon realizes the cost of his talent 
 i found the book somewhat plodding; like you were waiting for something important to happenand waiting and waiting and waiting eventually marie and werner's stories collide - but only briefly and completely unsatisfactorily i'm sure that's the point - that life is hardly satisfactory but still parts of the book were very interesting - the last third probably kept my attention best this wasn't a book that you can't put down though; very little tension (at least for me) yes i read this i admit it you caught me not only that i loved it it is a double sin i will likely have to one day repent for by reading piles of dostoyevsky while i tear out my hair in any case right once again into the breach to defend myself 
 this book is incredibly long it's just a fact all of them are but they go by so incredibly fast by the time i got to the third one i read it in three days the pages just keep turning i read at double speed i was so engrossed in the story and i must admit that usually i hate time travel romances ( i mean not that i have any experience trying them before never) but this one is not even about that or if it is it just makes it better 
 also there is a pile of historical information in this text it deals with the bonnie prince charlie uprising and the rest of the books go on to deal with the american colonies and the revolution by the time that they're done it's not just about the romance it's about medical treatment what horrid things scottish people ate the reality of what people would have suffered through which is in some cases i think a direct indictment of the scottish highlander bodice-rippers in which everyone is shining and perfect and with awfully clean white teeth i'd say this is more historical fiction than romance 
 but fine let's deal with the romance yes there is a lot of sex however i found it to also be deeply intimate and true brutal and real claire and jamie while apart are deeply attractive and sympathetic characters with a good deal of nobilty about them throw them together in love and they are beautifully frail selfish angry flawed i love that statement i really find them so incredibly touching 
 so there it's not just a romance novel i stick my tongue out oh so maturely at the readers of this review i always thought or imagined that there were these invisible lines trembling in our wake outlining our trajectories through life throbbing with electric energy lines that sometimes cross one other or follow in parallel ellipses without ever touching or meet up for one brief moment and then part a universe of lines crisscrossing in the void 
 anthony doerr's astonishing new novel ""all the light we cannot see"" follows the complex arcs of two such invisible lines through the lives of werner pfennig an orphan boy in pre-world war ii germany and marie-laure leblanc a blind girl living in paris with her father through riveting flash forwards and flash backs the novel charters the course of their lives as they struggle to find out wether it is possible to really own your life when it is swallowed by the black holes of history one is driven by a deep love of science while the other is inhabited by the power of books in the midst of the rise of german fascism and the birth of the french resistance how does youth manage to stay true to its essence 
 a war story a coming-of-age story a philosophical fable this is a novel that constantly oscillates between the moral uncertainties of life and the chiselled precision of the natural world that surrounds us between the political morass of war and the stupendous beauty of organisms the ocean the human brain 
 the language is so fantastically precise - anthony doerr does things with verbs that make entire paragraphs sing - that the visual component of this book is quite astounding 
 in the end what this novel illuminates is the miraculous impact that seminal events have on the rest of our lives whether it be the magic of radio broadcasts on the mysteries of science or the extraordinary adventures of jules verne's ""twenty thousand leagues under the sea"" 
 a deeply moving and enthralling work that echoes the power of early impressions on the building of a self such as the philosopher simon critchley recently evoked so beautifully in a stunning essay published in the new york times entitled ""the dangers of certainty"":

 masterful a couple months ago a little bird on the internet let me know that felicia day was writing a memoir 
 and honestly i didn't know how to feel about that 
 don't get me wrong i was happy for her i love books and it makes me happy when one of my friends is writing one it makes me even happier when one of their books is getting published it's like they're getting to have a baby but with only a fraction of the nausea and weight gain 
 what's more i'm a fan of felicia's she's done a lot of work that i really enjoy not just acting (dr horrible is still close to my heart after all these years) but the work she's done as a writer and producer has really impressed me 
 but at the same time i was scared because well i love books and i can be a very critical person and when i'm revising my own work trying to read a book for pleasure can be like feeding it into an angry woodchipper because my critical faculties are already engaged 
 when someone i like comes out with a book i'm always nervous what will i say if i don't like it 
 it's not that i was worried about the quality of her writing far from it i enjoyed the hell out of the guild and that was the pure child of her brain but there's a big difference between writing a screen play and writing a novel things people say on a screen and words you read on the page aren't the same and there's a big difference between a writing a season of episodes and a book-length manuscript 
 even so i went out of my way to get an advance reading copy of the book it's one of the few genuine powers i possess as an author and i abuse it at every opportunity 
 then with some trepidation i started reading 
 within just a couple pages i felt myself relax the writing was good better than that actually it turns out felicia's delightful turn of phrase translated really well to the printed page it actually made me laugh out loud in places in fact i think i might have laughed out loud more reading this book than any book i've read in years 
 it helps that the book is absolutely written in felicia's own voice and that voice is delightful: charming and earnest what's more she's led a strange life and isn't bashful talking about it with disarming honesty 
 but of all the things i liked in this book (and i liked a lot of them) my favorite thing was the fact that felicia doesn't shy away from discussing the dysfunctional parts of herself she talks about them plainly and goes into detail about how they've screwed up her life from time to time 
 sometimes this these stories are funny whimsical bizarre but there were a few chapters that stunned me chapters where i thought ""wow you feel that way too i didn't know"" 
 and that perhaps is the best thing a book can do for us sometimes it can help us feel like we are less alone 
 so is this book worth your time yes very yes 
 i'd recommend it to pretty much anyone whether or not you know or care who felicia day is in fact i plan on picking up some copies as gifts and i'm going to give them away the same way i did jenny lawson's last book 
 my one regret is that i didn't get my act together quickly enough to give felicia a promotional blurb but judging by the other folks who are already there (george rr martin jenny lawson ernie cline john scalzi cory doctorow) it doesn't look like she was hurting for endorsements 
 hell looking online i see that the finished version actually has an foreword by joss whedon i'm going to have to buy a new copy just so i can read *that* 
 so yeah give it a try seriously the doorbell rang the other day and when i answered it there was a very slick guy in a nice suit standing there and a limousine parked at the curb he started shaking my hand and wormed his way into the house 
 ""mr kemper i'm john doe with dee-bag industries incorporated i need you to sign some paperwork and take a ride with me don't worry i'll have you home in a day or two"" he said then he pulled a document out of his briefcase set it on the coffee table and pushed a pen in my hand 
 ""wait a second what the hell is this all about"" i said as i tried to pick up the paper to read it but doe kept trying to force my hand with the pen down on it so i couldn't see what it said 
 ""oh that's just legal mumbo-jumbo you'd rather try and read your mortgage agreement than this old thing just put your name down and let's be on our way shall we"" he said 
 there was a brief scuffle but i managed to distract him by messing up his carefully gelled hair as he shrieked and ran around looking for a mirror i finally got to read the document 
 ""this is a medical consent form what's going on"" i demanded as i shook the paper at him once he had combed and smoothed his hair back into perfection doe sighed 
 ""very well mr kemper i guess i'll have to come clean do you remember when you had your appendix out when you were in grade school"" 
 ""sure that gave me one of my better scars but that was like 30 years ago why are you here now"" i asked 
 ""you're probably not aware of this but your appendix was used in a research project by dbii"" doe said 
 ""really i assumed it just got incinerated or used in the hospital cafeteria's meatloaf special why would anyone want to study my rotten appendix"" 
 ""oh all kinds of research is done on tissue gathered during medical procedures most people don't know that but it's very common"" doe said 
 ""ok but why are you here now"" 
 ""well your appendix turned out to be very special it was secreting some kind of pus that no one had seen before after many tests it turned out to be a new chemical compound with commercial applications so a patent was filed based on that compound and turned into a consumer product"" doe admitted 
 ""that sounds disgusting what was it used in because i want to make sure to never buy it"" i said 
 ""it's the basis for the adhesive on post-it notes"" doe said 
 ""are you freaking kidding me post-it notes are based on my old appendix"" 
 ""i'm absolutely serious mr kemper now we at dbii need your help unfortunately for us you haven't had anything removed lately so i have to get your consent if we're going to do further studies"" doe said 
 ""but you already got my goo-seeping appendix i don't have another one"" i said 
 ""true but sales have been down for post-it notes lately so after the marketing and research boys talked it over for a while they thought we should bring you in for a full body scan maybe you've got a spleen giving out or something else that we could pull out and see if we could use it"" doe said 
 ""this is pretty damn disturbing"" i said 
 ""why you're an organ donor right same thing"" doe said 
 ""i don't consider someone lucking into an organ if the chiefs win a play-off game and i have a goddamn heart attack the same thing as companies making money off tissue i had removed decades ago and didn't know anything about"" i said 
 ""fortunately the american government and legal system disagree so how about it mr kemper will you come with me"" doe asked 
 ""i dunno what's my end of this you already owe me a fat check for the post-its"" 
 ""oh no you won't get any money from the post-its or if any future discoveries from your tissues lead to more gains"" doe said 
 ""that's complete bullshit"" 
 ""again the legal system disagrees with you but this is for science mr kemper you don't want to hold up medical scientific research that could save lives do you"" 
 ""it's for post-it notes"" 
 ""maybe but who is to say that the cure for some terrible disease isn't lurking somewhere in your genes could you live with yourself if you prevented crucial medical research just because you were ticked off that you didn't get any money for your appendix remember that it's not like you could have not had your appendix removed at least not if you wanted to keep living and i highly doubt that you would have had the resources to have it studied and discovered the adhesive for yourself even if you would have taken it home with you in a jar after it was removed we're the ones who spent all that money to get some good out of a piece of disgusting gunk that tried to kill you so shouldn't we be compensated what are you some kind of damn dirty hippie liberal socialist"" doe said in disgust 
 ""you're a hell of a corporate lackey doe"" i said 
 ""thank you"" 
 ""fine i'll do it"" i said as i signed the form ""but i want some free post-it notes"" 
 ""no deal steal them from work like everyone else"" doe said 
 ****** 
 obviously i'm a big fat liar and none of this happened but i really did have my appendix out as a kid plus my tonsils got yanked and i've had my fair share of blood taken over the years what this book taught me is that it's highly likely that some of my scraps are sitting in frozen jars in labs somewhere yours too if any of us have anything unique in our tissues that may be valuable for medical research it's possible that they'd be worth a fortune but we'd never see a dime of it 
 henrietta lacks couldn't be considered lucky by any stretch of the imagination a black woman who grew up poor on a tobacco farm she married her cousin and moved to the baltimore area her husband apparently liked to step out on her and henrietta ended up with stds and one of her children was born mentally handicapped and had to be institutionalized 
 in 1951 henrietta was diagnosed with cervical cancer by doctors at johns hopkins during her biopsy cell samples were taken and given to a researcher who had been working on the problem of trying to grow human cells henrietta's cancer spread wildly and she was dead within a year but her cells turned out to be an incredible discovery because they continued growing at a very fast rate 
 the doctor at johns hopkins started sharing his find for no compensation and this coincided with a large need for cell samples due to testing of the polio vaccine the hela cells would be crucial for confirming that the vaccine worked and soon companies were created to grow and ship them to researchers around the world since then henrietta's cells have been sent into outer space and subjected to nuclear tests and cited in over 60000 medical research papers 
 unfortunately no one ever asked henrietta's permission and her family knew nothing about the important role her cells played in medicine for decades poor and with little formal education henrietta's children were confused by what was actually done to their mother and upset when they learned that her tissue was part of a multi-million dollar industry that they've received no compensation from 
 rebecca skloot has written a fascinating book that clearly outlines why henrietta's cells were so important why she went unrecognized for decades the pain it's caused her family and the way that new medical discoveries over the last sixty years have opened a potential pandora's box of legal and ethical issues regarding tissue collection research patents and money this book brings up a lot of issues that we're probably all going to be dealing with in the future

 jesus fucking rollerblading christ 
 no fuck no i can't do it anymore you wanna read a historical love story with imperfect main characters go read karleen koen's dark angels 
 you wanna read a story about how fucked up stalin and the soviet union were pre during and post wwii go read the gulag archipelago 1918-1956 
 you wanna read an in-depth history of the european campaigns of wwii go read the guns at last light: the war in western europe 1944-1945 
 you wanna read a book about two of the most self-centered assholes in the history of literature read this book 
 we meet our female lead tatiana the day the nazi's invade russia her family freaks the fuck out like everyone else in the country does and they immediately spring into action sending their only son to ""safety"" other family members to get money out of the banks and their idiot youngest daughter tatiana to go get food to stockpile does she understand the severity of the situation no she fucking reads for a little while after everyone leaves because she never gets alone time 
 okay so that might be understandable because the girl is sixteen and has no idea what the reality of war is like (<- this is what i told myself to keep from getting pissed) then when she finally does go to get food she starts to notice that there are lines everywhere and places are sold out of the things she barely remembers that they need 
 imagine fucking that 
 of course she starts to frantically run around the city in fucking high heels and a pretty dress because it was sunday and she wanted to look nice how dafuq you gonna carry that much food in ill-fitting heels tania you think about that no no you fucking didn't you were too preoccupied with looking pretty you vapid little nitwit 
 so running around running around ""i have to catch this bus to get to the next grocery store in time but oh is that ice cream"" no no you are not going to stop and eat fucking ice cream right now (<-this is my disbelief talking) but oh yes yes she fucking is because she is a self-centered asshole 
 it's while sitting on a bench and eating her ice cream her beautiful long blonde hair flowing around her in the summer breeze that she meets the second most self-centered asshole in the history of literature alexander belov guess what he's hot he also saves her day by letting her into the officer's section of the grocery store so she can buy supplies to her heart's content then he and a buddy carry them all home for her because she can't because she's in fucking heels and has blisters 
 imagine fucking that 
 and so begins the basis of their entire relationship it can be summed up in one quote: 
 ""she needs me so much to take care of her and i desperately need to take care of her"" 
 that's it that's the entirety of this ""love"" story it's nothing but tatiana being a fucking tstl little mary sue and alex playing the fucking white knight to her damsel in distress 
 i know what you're thinking 
 welp sorry to break the news but 
 so alex and dimi his rat of a friend help tania bring the supplies home and lo and behold what do we discover that the handsome soldier our female lead has been lusting after is actually dating her sister 
 meet dasha the only decent person in the first two hundred pages of this book (that's as far as i got) because dasha is a good person she gets completely fucked over wanna know how her boyfriend and sister proceed to fall in love behind her back 
 does alex realize what's happening and do the right thing by breaking up with her hell no he's a self-centered asshole remember he's also a fucking sadist because he parades his relationship with dasha in front of tatiana who he secretly sees every fucking day 
 does tatiana tell her sister what's going on hell no she's a self-centered asshole remember she's also a fucking masochist because she continues to see alex even with him dating her sister and acting like a monumental douche 
 so that's it self-centered asshole sadist with a hero complex meets self-centered asshole masochist with princess syndrome they fall in love and their theme song is fuck everyone else they'll probably dance to it at the wedding wide smiles on their asshole faces as they fucking tango across the graves of those they sacrificed on the altar of their love 
 this review can also be found at the alliterates hillbilly elegy by jd vance is a 2016 harper publication 
 when i first noticed this book popping up on goodreads i admit the title really threw me i hate that word 'hillbilly' because it sounds derisive and conjures up stereotypes but then i noticed the reviews were stellar for the most part and so i took a closer look 
 once i finished reading this book i was stunned i actually shed tears and nearly talked myself out of leaving a comment at all but my husband convinced me to at least say my peace even if i lost every friend i had on goodreads when one makes a stand they must be prepared for the consequences- but i hope i still have all my friends after this rant is done but hubby is right this needs to get said so here goes 
 first of all let me say that vance is a prime example of what i have taught my children to believe i have often spoken out about those who make excuses for why they ended up living a life of crime or wound up stuck in a vicious economic cycle vance made some solid decisions and was able to move away from a bleak and depressed area and the rather colorful upbringing he had managed to find a way to garner not just a solid education but an ivy league education and is now working at a white collar job living the american dream he is obviously very proud of his achievements and i am proud for him but i do think his ivy league status has gone to his head just a little bit 
 what rubbed me the wrong way about this book is mr vance's tone he puts down anyone who works a blue collar job as though that is the worst thing that could ever befall someone he is arrogant patronizing and superior in his assessment of his family and those who reside in the appalachians but doesn't stop there insinuating anyone who works blue collar jobs should be earnestly seeking a way out of that embarrassing predicament 
 now i do not live in that area i have never even visited the area but i do know all about depressed locations with schools that suffer from low funding where parents do not necessarily stress formal education to their children where factory work is always available and is the staple of and the sole source of income for the community i understand and agree with mr vance's concerns for these areas and the sparse opportunities these folks have the attitudes they convey and their defensiveness at times 
 but on the other hand 
 my husband and i are both blue collar workers i worked in supermarket management until i retired my husband worked on a dairy farm then went on to work for two local factories he has done this type of work his entire life but he makes a good living has a decent health care package and something many people coming out of universities do not: a strong work ethic principles and integrity 
 so i felt vance's remarks on blue collar employment were unfair i know many people who work right alongside my husband who have college educations they do not sit at a desk where a suit carry a briefcase or make more money that we do they have a job and are happy and thankful to have it 
 but not everyone is college material and not everyone wants to sit in a cubicle behind a desk all day my husband would be miserable in such a position he enjoys working with his hands is creative artistic and can put even the most tech savvy people to shame with his computer skills 
 but to suggest a person who could not get loans for college or grants or scholarships who settled into a long term position doing blue collar work should be embarrassed by the life they live and should be ashamed of themselves for not getting up off their sorry no good lazy asses to do better for themselves or their families is an arrogant presumption and groups together a whole lot of people and stereotypes them unfairly and i felt like i had been personally slapped by the author as he looks down his nose at blue collar work with an air of superiority deciding on our behalf what path our lives should take and what is best for us the environment we should we live in the types of jobs we should hold and what will make us the happiest 
 i have all my teeth( no mountain dew mouth here) i never beat my kids or screamed obscenities at them caused a scene in public had numerous 'men' in my life packed a pistol dipped tobacco or neglected my children i was never a drug addict or alcoholic i have never hit someone encouraged violence or praised it i hate bullying of any kind and believe there are far better ways to solve problems or conflict than resorting to violence 
 i am an honest law abiding tax paying citizen the same as you i watch the same movies read the same books and enjoy the same leisure activities you do i travel garden am an animal rights advocate fight for women's rights and have feminist tendencies i raised two decent human beings one of which is in college the other taking a different path but both are productive citizens making good money and are living positive and moral lives 
 i live in a nice brick home have newer model cars a nice landscaped lawn and live in a nice neighborhood and insist on living inside my means which means having to say no to things i want sometimes my hometown is a rural college town with ranching and dairy work being predominant occupations as well four factories and the college which also provides job opportunities many people who left here to get their educations returned to start or raise their families they want to live here like living here and are as upwardly mobile as they wish to be they could leave anytime and move to the city but enjoy the slower pace of life the sense of community the value systems we adhere to and a clean safe environment for their children 
 i know wealthy highly educated people who suffer from drug addiction problems with alcohol are abusive physically and verbally who neglect their kids have epic entitled hissy fits yelling and screaming in public when they didn't get their way and instill a sense of entitlement on their children who give little or nothing back to their communities and believe it not support the republican candidate they have numerous affairs cheat lie steal and blend families with the best of themmany of the exact same actions qualities and traits mr vance was so embarrassed by from his own family 
 i did not miss the moral of vance's story but i did find his deliverance less than impressive and the timing of this release is not lost on me is this a political statement a plea for those in rural areas not to buy into trump's rhetoric i mean after all those of us working blue collar jobs without the benefit of a formal education must be easily misled by all of the republican candidate's promises lies and claims right i'm not sure if the author was trying to make a statement on that concern but others seem to believe he was and for the record we do not support the republican candidate not that this is anyone's business but because this author seems to have figured out which way i lean based on my economic educational and professional background i thought i'd mention it 
 but here is my question after everything has been said and done what solution or resolution is vance offering for the plight of those living in the depressed areas of the appalachians you can't call attention to a blight but offer no alternatives or suggestions on how to change things for the better 
 so there you go i hope you won't think less of me now because my family lives in a small rural town and has worked blue collar jobs all our lives and have little or no formal education or think of me as some ignorant backwoods person who is too stupid to see past all the political rhetoric or is morally bankrupt or a pistol toting grandma with a wad of chewing tobacco in my mouth full of rotting teeth i'm not depressed or unhappy nor do i wish to be pitied i try to learn something new all the time i strive to better myself to stay up to date and informed try new things but i must do this by teaching myself and there is nothing wrong with that in my opinion 
 i fully expect to be chastised for my response to this book will probably lose the respect of some or many maybe all of you but i felt like i had to stand up for those who are not white collar workers after vance made it clear he holds such positions in contempt and with disdain and believes those of us who are employed in these positions are shameful an embarrassment a blight on this country and should strive for a different life one just like his one he can endorse 
 i don't like being placed in a category or box this way and don't appreciate the suggestion that because i have little formal education or am not working in a white collar occupation that automatically makes me poor ignorant white trash someone in need of guidance a republican and a conservative or a trump supporter to assume such is for all intents and purposes classist and profiling and that is the thing that turned me off about this book 
 on a more positive note i loved his grandmother go mamaw i thought she was a pistol- if you will pardon the pun and she obviously loved her grandson which is something from his past the author should be proud of 
 2 stars it was the comparisons to all the light we cannot see that attracted me to the nightingale though both novels are set during ww2 the similarities for me stopped there all the light is a magical novel electric with beautiful resounding prose and refined artistry; the nightingale is a novel motored essentially by cliche and exaggeration 
 cliched writing isn't just resorting continually to stock phrases (though hannah does this a lot); it's also straining for tension through exaggeration to the point where dramatic tension degenerates into melodrama no surprise that cliched phrases often perform a task of exaggeration - ""she was scared to death"" ""she couldn't believe her eyes"" 
 the nightingale reads like ya fantasy fiction everything is wildly exaggerated so that ww2 is perceived as a kind of post nuclear holocaust world where this one event utterly eclipses the world we live in the perspective of the novel is one of hindsight as if all the characters are experiencing not the daily hardships of the war but the totality of all ww2's horrors it's like her research consisted of jotting down every single horror story and deprivation and shoe-horning them all into her story it's mostly set in a small town in the middle of france yet this small town is ""swarming"" with german soldiers gestapo ss jews bomb damage as if the entire war is centred there (i was only surprised hitler and eva braun didn't have a holiday home there as well) the two main characters are loaded with the ordeals & accomplishments of an entire circuit of resistance members isabelle is every soe heroine rolled into one and vianne is a kind of female schindler 
 plausibility is often sacrificed to ""thrills and spills"" in the space of three pages a jewish woman is told the nazis will arrive at her house the next morning three paragraphs later - or two hours later - she has magically acquired false identity papers three paragraphs later she is about to cross through a peaceful checkpoint when inexplicably the german guard begins machine gunning everyone as if he got bored just checking papers he even takes the trouble to shoot the woman's nine year old child in the back this is all passed off without explanation as if it were a normal wartime incident 
 the big surprise though is that the ending is genuinely moving and really well managed hence all the gushing reviews basically to enjoy this you need to anaesthetize your critical faculties that done i guess there's enjoyment to be had because hannah is a decent storyteller and is good at developing human relationships no doubt it'll soon be a hollywood film so freaking excited for this book this is the first book i've really enjoyed reading after my horrid book slump and i loved it i need more of kerri's writing in my life especially with her amazing characters like bloody jack ;) what if you had the chance to live your life again and again until you finally got it right 
 ursula todd is born in a snowstorm in england in 1910 but dies before she can take her first breath during that same snowstorm she was born again and lives to tell the tale; again and again life after life tells the story of ursula's lives as with each new life she makes small changes that send her on a completely different path 
 i feel like i'm the only person on the planet that thought this book was overhyped and over rated sure kate atkinson has this trippy ability to create this bleak world while still managing to add some wit and compassion but it wasn't the writing that was at fault the premise of the book makes it sound really good but let's face it; it is just groundhog day in disguise the book is clever but it tries too hard to be clever and it didn't really turn out the way it should have; for me anyway this book is getting so many rave reviews i feel like i am a black sheep just telling people it did not work 
 as i said before there is nothing wrong with the writing; kate atkinson has created this lyrical narrative and i did find myself being swept away in the words i even felt like at times i was reading this book without thinking about what was happening; a few times i had to stop and process before continuing i almost found myself not noticing a death and ursula's life starting again and that could have got me completely lost i did feel like kate atkinson did however overdo the twists and it turned out to be a roundabout way to retell the same story over and over again with different outcomes this could have worked; and it sounds like it worked for many people but i sadly wasn't one of them 
 i wonder if kate atkinson was trying something different and experimental where she could play with the character's death and life explore the concept of life's choices and their consequences but because there were no real penalty to ursula's life i wonder if it really worked do you ever have deja vu (i don't think so but i could check with the kitchen) life after life just seems to repeat the same scenes some readers might gain a sense of familiarity and for me it just felt like i wasn't getting anywhere 
 life after life is the kind of book you should probably read in a real cold climate; the snowy dark and sometimes bleakness of the novel seems to call for it maybe read snuggled up on a dark winters night and don't forget your booties 'cause it's cooooold out there today (it's coooold out there every day what is this miami beach) it is just the book that would work better in the cold; though it is never cold here in townsville maybe that's why it didn't work for me 
 i really wanted to enjoy this book; i will try another kate atkinson novel because i really think she has a great style just so happened life after life was not for me and i know people loved this book and will probably complain about this review but at least it was just an excuse to put some groundhog day quotes into something this book has had so many positive reviews so maybe it is just me if the book sounds like something you'd like then don't let this review stop you is it too early for flapjacks

 (i read the rest of the book over the course of the evening and since i am not pro-spoiler i will not continue with the emotional roller coaster except to say that there was one) 
 (also read this book it is truly truly special) 
 ps - watch for a maximum shelf issue from shelf awareness on this title ;) such a thrilling read the main characters were all so interesting and i loved how much mystery and tension there was in each of their stories i also loved the rich world building i'm not usually big on history but i loved the way the history was presented here between the setting and the writing everything was so vivid which just amped up the intensity 
 overall this was a fantastic historical standalone i definitely recommend it especially if you like emotionally gripping reads with lots of tension and fascinating characters beautiful i read this book as an advance galley long before it became a thing and i did not read this book because i wanted vance to explain trump though he's somehow been chosen by liberal media as the person to do just that (though the handful of interviews i saw seemed more like chris matthews wanted to pat himself on the back for having a guest with hillbilly cred than actually listening to what vance had to say) i didn't think this book would have mass appeal because no one outside of appalachia seems to give a shit about appalachia and its success has surprised me it's not a perfect book but i do think it's a good starting point as long as you remember that this is just one guy's perspective on his own experiences 
 i picked this up because vance is from the same part of the world as me and i wanted to read about something that i could relate to that cover photo looks like it could have been taken on the road that i grew up on in one of the poorest places in ohio where appalachia and the midwest intersect it was so poor that a girl who made me cry in first grade was featured on a cbs news story on american poverty 
 i always knew it was different from the cities and suburbia reflected in pop culture but moving away and realizing just how different it is from other places was still a weird experience for me it's so rural that i struggle to describe it adequately to the people i've met since living in philadelphia and the dc metro area it matches stereotypes to some extent but the stereotypes also often miss the mark people not from appalachia really don't get it and they're often way too quick to dismiss it i never really fit in in appalachia for so many different reasons but i'll also fiercely defend it put me in a room of east-coast natives making jokes about ""uneducated rednecks"" and i will probably grow a second head poor rural white people are the last group that you can make fun of without being considered un-pc and i think that's a huge problem that creates a lot of divisiveness books like this one show a culture that is underrepresented 
 vance grew up in a small town between cincinnati and dayton (tbh i never really thought of that as appalachian because cincinnati is on the opposite side of the state from me but vance's family moved north from kentucky so of course it is) his family experienced many of the same migration patterns cultural touchstones and poverty-related struggles that describe the lives of my extended family and the families of my high-school peers his father was never a consistent presence in his life his mother struggled with drug addiction his grandparents were the greatest source of normalcy in his life but they taught him to live by a hillbilly code of loyalty and self-sufficiency though they encouraged him to take his education seriously wanted a better life for him than they'd had he didn't do well in school and didn't seems to think he'd ever have a future outside of appalachia 
 but then he joined the marines and it turned his life around with a new sense of self-determination a broader perspective of the larger world and developed leadership skills vance enrolled at ohio state university and eventually went on to yale law school--an unheard of achievement for someone from his family his hometown and his struggling public high school a lot of the experiences he had in new haven frustrated him and that was definitely something i could relate to however i think those experiences caused vance to dig into his conservative values in a way that i can not relate to 
 there's been some sociocultural analysis of appalachia but i don't think anything's ever focused so specifically on appalachia ohio that's something that i definitely appreciated as a native i'm also unaware of any exploration of the region that's actually been done by a native and therefore possesses an insider understanding of what makes the people tick there really are a lot of very specific personality traits that are unique to the scots-irish people who settled in the ohio river valley and these traits make no sense to outsiders when people talk about how ridiculous it is that west virginia tends to vote republican even though it seems to be against their interests they are fundamentally misunderstanding a lot of these traits that are so ingrained in the psychology of the state and that frustrates me to no end 
 vance focuses primarily on his own personal story he does cite some research about the region in general--but this is mostly for context and is not meant to be exhaustive i think it's important to remember that vance is conservative though he doesn't seem to be as far right-wing as the tea party so his ideas may not appeal to the point of view of many liberals coming to this book trying to make sense of trump by giving this book four stars that's not to say i necessarily agree with his political point of view but i think it's important to hear different voices 
 vance makes an attempt to extrapolate from his own experience to explain why ""simple"" social welfare is not enough to help address the problems of appalachia the short answer is: there are no easy solutions because so many of the problems are circular people don't succeed because they don't see anything to be hopeful about and they don't see any room for hope because so few have succeeded without hope no one bothers to take baby steps towards the kind of changes that can move the region into a better economic reality i think some people see that as blaming the poor for being poor--which is a thing that happens and is a gross oversimplification--but i do think there are both internal and external factors at play here 
 i do wish i'd come away from this book feeling a little more optimistic that it offered up some more concrete solutions but i suppose that wasn't really vance's stated purpose and it's not really something that falls squarely on his shoulders he's still young--just 31 he likely only finished yale two years before this book was written if i've done the math correctly perhaps ""concrete"" is something that he can bring with some more time or maybe he's just not the guy that's going to be bring ""concrete"" regardless i do think it's important to listen to the voices of appalachia change is never going to happen until we all start listening to each other and not just applying our own prejudices to each other's words i was cleaning up after the wife and i had dinner last night and there was a small amount of green beans left there weren't nearly enough for another serving to make them worth saving so i dumped them in the sink but just as i was about to turn on the garbage disposal i realized that to the pows described in unbroken those few green beans i was about to mulch would have been a feast they would have risked torture and beatings for i was disgusted with myself for the rest of the night you know the book you're reading is hitting you hard when you feel that much shame for letting a tiny bit of food go to waste 
 louie zamperini is one of those guys who definitely earned that greatest generation label the son of italian immigrant parents louie was a rebellious kid who was constantly into one form of mischief or another but when he finally channeled his energy into running he became a high school track star in california louie was so good that he made the 1936 olympics in berlin at the age of 19 and even though he didn't medal he ran one lap of a race so quickly that he electrified the crowd and even caught hitler's attention 
 as a college runner louie held several national records and many thought that he'd be the man to eventually break the four minute mile he was poised to do well in the 1940 olympics but then world war ii cancelled the games louie left college and ended up in the air corps even though he was scared of planes he became a bombardier and went to the pacific after pearl harbor louie survived several missions including one where their b-24 barely made it back with over 500 holes in it 
 while on a search and rescue mission louie's plane crashed in the ocean and only he and two others survived with few supplies on two tiny life rafts they'd endure exposure starvation thirst and sharks 
 however after finally reaching an island and being captured by the japanese louie's hellish experience as a pow would make him miss the raft and the sharks starved beaten tortured and degraded louie also faces extra punishment at the hands of a brutally sadistic guard who singled him out louie and the other prisoners desperately try to hang on long enough for america to win the war and free them 
 i didn't care anything about race horses but found laura hillenbrand's seabiscuit an incredibly interesting read she's surpassed that book here with this well researched story hillenbrand creates vivid descriptions of louie's childhood the berlin olympics the life of an air man in the pacific and a japanese pow camp while also telling the stories of the people around louie 
 she also does a superior job of describing a phase of world war ii that tends to get overlooked japanese war crimes against prisoners the number of prisoners killed by the japanese through starvation beatings and forced labor are staggering but hillenbrand also shines a light on the japanese policy of killing all pows if that area was about to be invaded per her research they were preparing to begin slaughtering prisoners in japan in late august and september of 1945 but the dropping of the atomic bombs and the surrender of the emperor probably saved those pows lives if the war would have carried on or a conventional invasion done then mostly likely those prisoners would have been killed* 
 *(do not take this as my personal feelings about whether nuclear weapons should have been used or not i'm just relaying a part of the book here and hillenbrand makes no argument as to whether dropping the bombs was justified she writes that many of the pows believed that the bombings probably saved their lives and leaves it at that and if you feel like trying to start a comment fight about it i'm just going to delete it so don't bother i left my sword and shield at home today and don't feel like battling trolls) 
 ultimately while this is a book about people enduring incredible hardship and cruelty during war it's a hopeful book not a depressing one great writing and the care that hillenbrand took with the people and places make this compelling reading i wrote it so i think it's pretty good 425 
 so much fun why the fuck is the average rating for this book like 43 when i spent 75% of the book wanting to bash the stuffings out of the main love interest with a rusty one-pointed morning star 
 but ugh since everyone loves it allow me to present my version of it 
 if the duke demands - khanh's version 
 *main characters* 
 trent: duke main love interest stodgy and with a stick in his ass bigger than the washington monument 
 miranda: an orphan who runs an orphanage in case the author hasn't made her life tragic enough yet she also does things like rewrites shakespeare so that hamlet contains pirates 19th century manic pixie dream girl 
 robert and quinn: trent's siblings and major fuckbois 
 lady jane: trent's aspired future duchess she is very chill perfection like a polar pop 
 lady diana: robert's love interest her hair is the color of afternoon light on a field of wheat 
 act---oh who the fuck are we kidding let's just get on with it 
 *ahem* 
 miranda: oh my god oh my god tonight's my chance to totally bone robert the man i've loved my entire life and how better to do it than to sneak into his room and seduce him he'll totally see me as a woman then what could possibly go wrong 
 trent: *sighs mournfully* i am so burdened by the ducal office it sucks all this responsibility and i feel such guilt you know because i practically killed my dad and all and by killed my dad i mean i wasn't there to say goodbye to him after he was injured in a tragic accident that nobody could have foreseen and to make it worse i killed my dad/failed to say goodbye to him because i was in bed with an actress to compensate for my failure i will be totally perfect and marry only a respectable woman and not do shady shit like meet a chick for a tryst in her room at all 
 miranda: **as lady rose** well hellooooooooooo 
 trent: damn bitch gimme some of that pussy 
 *bow chicka bow wow* 
 trent and miranda: oh fuck what the fuck are you doing here 
 trent: i've known you since you were 12 what the fuck who could have foreseen that at age like 19 or something that you'd be a woman and have a woman's body what the hell who could have foreseen this 
 miranda: oh fuck oh fuck oh fuck i should have thought this through ok we'll both forget about this ok 
 trent: yeah i mean totally i need to find a real duchess and totally not you cause i know my dead dad won't approve so how about we help each other i'll halfheartedly help you win my brother robert who is courting the lovely diana whose hair is the color of starlight upon a blade of grass in midsummer 
 miranda: deal in return i'll help you find the perfect duchess despite the fact that i'm a simple country girl who has no idea who the fuck is in the aristocracy and no idea how the fuck to conduct myself in the ton 
 act whatever 
 miranda: oh my god we're in town i'm gonna flitter about being an unpredictable little lady and everyone will love me because i'm just so fucking special and delightful 
 trent: god she's hot how did i not realize she was so hot but whatever i'm here to court the lovely and cool-headed lady jane 
 lady jane: ta 
 robert: oh my god it's lady diana she of hair the color of spun golden candy floss upon a stick of diamonds 
 miranda: my heart it is broken but damn trent is so cute how did i not notice how cute he is 
 trent: oh god i know i'm supposed to be helping you get my brother but hhhhhhhhnnnnnnnnnng damn girl you're hot let me put my hands under that skirt in front of all these people at a play let's hope nobody sees us and you won't get ruined cause i sure as hell ain't marrying you lol 
 miranda: oh no trent i can't why not instead of doing it in front of a theatre audience you try to finger me inside a moving carriage first 
 trent: deal and remember i'm not marrying you i want lady jane right lady jane 
 lady jane: ta trent 
 trent: god lady jane is so perfect so lovely so composed but if only she responds to my caresses the same way that little improper sprite does let me kiss lady jane and be sure 
 **one very proper kiss later** 
 lady jane: ta 
 trent: fuck she didn't even make me hard 
 act who the hell cares 
 miranda: oh my god all his wandering fingers have got me feeling tingly i know i'm not a proper duchess for him but i want to give myself to him take me trent 
 trent: you know i ain't gonna marry you bitch but yeah gimme that pussy 
 *the next night* 
 miranda: oh my god i'm so stupid how could i possibly have done that given my virtue to someone who will never marry me and who has ruined me whatever let's do it again 
 trent: yeah get over here gurl you know i'm still not gonna marry you right 
 **the next night** 
 miranda: what have i done i've fallen in love with him out of nowhere the only way to cure this is by fucking him again cause surely he'll see that i'm right for him by proving that i have self-control and that i have the miens of a duchess 
 trent: i'm not gonna marry you but i will have sex with you again 
 miranda: ok that's all i want *_* 
 **the next morning** 
 robert and quinn: oh fuuuuuuuuuuuuck trent you're fucking miranda yeah yeah you go bruh wait what were you thinking 
 trent: be quiet motherfuckers if you reveal this to anyone i'll fucking cut your balls and your allowance off i'm just fucking her i don't love her and will never marry her 
 miranda: **accidentally overhears** what *burst into tears* this is brand new information 
 trent: but i've been telling you this 
 miranda: *wails and runs away* 
 trent:  
 ugh i'm tired whatever they had a happy ever after ugh this book really loved this book and it's story because i personally have never heard about this side of the war before and i'm so grateful i know about it now 45 stars really liked this one it was fun and hilarious and romantic and i didn't want it to end monty's voice had me completely hooked from the beginning--i enjoyed his character so much and i loved how he grew over the course of the book i did feel that some aspects of the plot were a bit shaky but if you can suspend your disbelief a little and just go with it it is such a fun ride and i would definitely recommend it 45 really enjoyed it several years ago i worked at an art gallery here in anchorage though i loved the art i wasn't much good at selling it more often than not i just chatted up the customers who were from all over the world 
 one night four elderly people wandered in they told me they were from a tiny island off the coast of southern england called ""guernsey"" i'd never heard of it so they proudly explained it was the only part of british soil that had been occupied by the nazis during world war ii the island was occupied for a long five years; an experience to which they had all been witnesses at that moment guernsey was marked in my mind 
 mary ann shaffer and annie barrow's new book ""the guernsey literary and potato peel pie society"" is an opportunity to travel back in time to 1946 guernsey 
 beginning early 1946 in london juliet ashton a british writer and former war journalist is emerging from the ashes of the war to rebuild her life and her identity she has lost her home and all her possessions most regrettably her book collection out of the blue she responds to correspondence started by a resident of guernsey who has managed to obtain a second-hand book once owned by juliet in which she had long ago written her name and address through this initial contact juliet meets an entire community and the course of her life is redirected 
 easily reminiscent of helene hanff's epistolary classic ""84 charing cross road"" the novel is written in the epistolary style shaffer and barrow skillfully use this medium to successfully establish their characters and a solid storyline 
 charming funny sweet and thoughtful ""the guernsey literary and potato peel pie society"" is a story that women might find more appealing than men yet it is unflinching in its wartime recollections the deprivations and devastation of the time are imaginatively and convincingly conveyed 
 at its core this is a book about the love of reading and the magic of books 
 i highly highly recommend ""the guernsey literary and potato peel pie society"" excellent writing strong concept i am personally burnt out on slavery narratives so i cannot say this was a pleasure to read so much unrelenting horror whitehead does an excellent job of portraying slavery and america as a slave nation the idea of the underground railroad as an actual railroad is so smart and interesting i wish he had actually done more with the railroad itself there were some sentences where i thought ""now you are just showing off"" the amount of research the author did is clear throughout there is some really interesting structural work at play i wanted some of the secondary characters to be more fully developed this book is going to do very well and rightly so dear reader 
 many thanks for your interest in z you might appreciate knowing a little bit more about what went into the creation of the novel and why i chose to write fiction about people whose lives are so thoroughly documented in biographies 
 z is fiction but my research was extensive and thorough and in telling the story i've stayed very close to the established facts my personal approach to biographical fiction is to unearth and then represent the truth even when it contradicts what people think they know about the characters involved much of what we think we know about the fitzgeralds comes from unreliable sources or has been spun into half-true myth my mission was to set the record straight 
 popular culture (midnight in paris for one example) has made zelda into a caricature reduced her to being only an edgy flapper or only an unstable jealous spouse or only a pathetic ""insane"" drain of her husband's creativity and life she was edgy--sometimes she was jealous--sometimes she was unstable--sometimes but in the same way that none of us can be or should be defined by one aspect of our lives zelda cannot be defined so simply either 
 z is the story of a complex and fascinating woman who was so much more than i knew when i began researching her life she was exceptional in so many ways but she was also human 
 best wishes 
 therese anne fowler date i finished this book: 06/09/2013 
 date i was ready to review this book: never 
 unfortunately i have to review it because it is due back to the library tomorrow so here comes my completely insufficient review 
 this book is by khaled hosseini 
 really what more is there to say i knew it would be wonderful 
 i have to admit that the problem i ran into was that i was comparing it to his previous two books too often and let's face it they were amazing and this book is incredible in its own right too but it's not to be compared so i tried to view this as its own book (which it most certainly is) and forget i had ever read the other two and that this was the first time i was experiencing hosseini 
 i'm not going to recap it would be pretty difficult to not give anything away there are many stories within this one story the characters are intertwined although many will never realize that they are the story comes full circle but this is mr khaled hosseini so i didn't expect a full blown happy ending and *spoiler alert* i didn't really get one 
 none of this business going on: 
 although i will say that maybe disney and hosseini are of one mind or at least sebastian and hosseini: 
 yes it is sebastian yes it is 
 what have i learned from this book 
 we (the human race) have (mostly) good intentions but we (mostly) do not follow through we soothe ourselves we convince ourselves we justify our actions or our lack of actions we have an ""out of sight out of mind"" way of thinking it's a human flaw and sometimes it has consequences that we cannot comprehend consequences that we may never realize because hey it's out of sight oh sure just like him to point out what is wrong with me not that i'm taking it personally 
 one thing anyone who has read my other reviews should know is that i frequently complain about: 
 1 not making me care about the characters enough 
 2 not being able to envision the surroundings - the people the buildings the culture etc 
 i don't experience this problem with this book the writing is so rich that i felt like i was there my emotions reflected the emotions of the characters i was invested 
 i am not ashamed to admit that i went back to chewing on my nails while reading this - a habit i gave up over a decade ago 
 something bad is going to happen 
 you would think this was an edge-of-the-seat suspense novel it's not but it is heartbreaking i bet i cried no less than ten times granted i cried when they showed a bear on the local news that they rescued from a telephone pole so i cry more than the average bear (ha ha ha) but it was still really heartbreakingover and over and over because there were so many intertwined stories 
 i really enjoyed this book i didn't love it in the same way i loved the previous two but i loved it still and i will give you a parting paragraph that is an example of the beautiful writing that makes me savor every word of this book: 
 now and then when she turned to tap ash into a saucer i stole a quick glance at the red polish on her toenails at the gold-tinged sheen of her shaved calves the high arch of her foot and always at her full perfectly shaped breasts there were men walking this earth i marveled who had touched those breasts and kissed them as they had made love to her what was left to do in life once you had done that where did a man go next once he'd stood at the world's summit 
 -------------------------- 
 i just finished this i am emotionally drained review coming soon 
 -------------------------- 
 04/18/2013 
 diddid i just read that there is a giveaway for this shut the front door 
 too much 
 ok i'll settle for cute and hope for the best ;) 
 -------------------------- 
 what a new book by khaled hosseini i can'ti just can'ti can't even think straight right now becauseohmygoodnessiamsososososososoexciiiiiiiiiited 
 i can't wait 
 have i mentioned how excited i am 
 i am so excited i am going to start with review with a disclaimer this review is subjective from my point of view etc i thought this book was terrible bad no good you don't have to agree with me and you could think that this was the most amazing book and your eyes almost exploded from all the awesomeness that traveled through them to reach your brain which leapt in your skull with every sentence you read and that is fine i do not think that you are inferior to me 
 now on to my review stop here for spoilers (although you might regret it it's an awesome review) 
 i am not one to judge books by their covers although a good cover is always a bonus and this book has a excellent one props to the graphic designer combined with being on the new york times best seller list and having an first rate premise i thought this one was a winner but i was wrong dead wrong (ok that is a little dramatic) if i was describe my reading experience like the ocean tides sometimes i would be fine floating near the shore but other times it would sweep me out to sea with its ridiculousness the conclusion didn't help the novel's case it left a distinctly bitter taste in my mouth 
 so basically the premise is that a couple tom and isabel living on a island in a lighthouse in australia find a dead man and baby ashore isabel filled with grief from her last three miscarriages begs her husband to kidnap the baby and bury the dead man in a ditch so she can be fulfilled as a woman and finally have a child she assumes that the mother is dead so i mean is she really doing anything wrong it's like when you find a stray dog and it has a collar what if the dog was being abused so that's why it ran away it's your duty to keep that cute dog and love it forever except this is a baby now i have never had a miscarriage nor have i ever had children so i guess this is why i hated isabel so much i don't understand her point of view at all i agreed with tom and was pretty mad when his sympathies got the better of him i mean really it's a baby people it is a human life you're messing with 
 so tom and isabel visit the main land like every three years and this time they bring the baby who they have named lucy for her christening and to show off to everyone now here comes the twist: the mother is alive shocker i know so tom once again is like ""hey this is kidnapping now and the mother is literally insane with grief maybe we should give back her baby"" and isabel is all like ""no i can't have babies and i am a selfish person who is pretending to be a good person by saying it is better for the baby if she stays with us we can't confuse lucy"" for me i have always thought love was doing what is best for the person you care for apparently this is not what isabel thinks love is so this makes her the villain of the story in my perspective 
 so of course tom and isabel are found out eventually all by tom's doing so he takes the blame for everything this is the point where i want to give up on the book and it's not because i hate isabel for letting tom take the blame to make him suffer for taking lucy away the story is full of pointless dialog and characters (and not even jane austin style with enjoyable pointless dialog) it is like stedman's publisher was like ""this novel has to be 300+ pages so get on that and write me some more"" i think i would have enjoyed this story much more if it was a short story i skimmed the last chapters just so i could be done with it 
 now there are some redeeming factors to this novel ( i mean it's not like this is 50 shades of gray terrible i gave it two stars)  stedman is a great writer when it comes down to descriptions of the island of janus and little antidotes about the 1920's in australia i just didn't like her characters not one of them 
 so my conclusion is read this book for yourself and make up your own opinion as for me i still need to learn that ""judging a book by its cover"" is a phrase for a reason 
 ***edit*** 
 so i just found out that they are making this book into a movie because hollywood 
 http://wwwimdbcom/title/tt2547584/ref_=nv_sr_1 i would like 409 pages of my life back 
 (watch my full review:) 
 https://wwwyoutubecom/watchv=ssib8 idk sounds kinda dumb earlier this year i was one of the lucky people jenny sent an advance reading copy of her newest book to 
 the simple upshot i loved it i loved it even more than her first book which i enjoyed so much that i bought multiple copies to give away as christmas presents 
 the bad news is that my life is such a bloody shambles that i didn't get back to her in time for a gushy blurb to make it onto the back of her book (not that she particularly needed one from me she's got gaiman allie brosh and all manner of other fancy folk singing her praises) 
 still i loved the book and when i love a book this much i want to talk about it i want to encourage people to read the book so that your lives will be dramatically embettered 
 i finished reading the book on an airplane and i was so happy and weepy and amazed that i sent jenny the following series of text messages: 
 ""jenny after a long delay i've finally finished your book while flying while it's still fresh in my mind here are some potential blurbs for your book"" 
 ""this book made me laugh in a restaurant it made me cry on an airplane it made me feel like maybe i'm not a total human trainwreck it made me resolve to spend more time being furiously happy"" 
 ""i wish jenny lawson was my neighbor"" 
 ""this book is a good book and you should buy this book and read this book"" 
 ""when i grow up i want to be joss whedon but if i don't have to grow up i'd like to be jenny lawson instead"" 
 ""jenny lawson is a force for good in the world"" 
 ""when i finally give up on the world and retreat to the safety of my blanket fort jenny lawson is on the short list of people who will always be welcome there"" 
 ""if everyone was like jenny lawson the world would be a better place also a stranger more surreal place with more abundant opportunities to attend raccoon rodeos"" 
 ""this is the best book i've read all year"" 
 so is this book worth your time yes absolutely yes it's finally out and if you don't buy it and read it you are not living the best possible life ryfyw bjd :

 w'qr `l~ nfs~ b'n~ ln 'krr mthl tlk lkhtyy'@ _ lnhyz ltbqt~ _ thny@an why write a review if i am such an atypical reader 
 i will keep this brief since i feel most readers will not react as i have but isn't it important that all views are voiced 
 all readers must agree that the flipping back and forth between different time periods makes this book more confusing i believe it must be said loudly and clearly that the current fascination with multiple threads and time shifts is only acceptable when they add something to the story when employment of such improves the story in this book they do not improve the story perhaps jumping from one scene to another can increase suspense but must one also flip back and forth in time in addition more and more books are made for audios and this is not helpful when you cannot flip back to see where you are finally time switches unnecessarily lengthen the novel 
 secondly be aware when you choose this book that the book is not only about ww2 but also a diamond that some of the characters quite a few in fact believe has magical powers those who possess the stone will not die but people around that person will come to misfortune this is all stated in one of the very first chapters; it is not a spoiler this aspect of the book turns the story into a mystery novel where is the gem who has it the result is that you have a heavy dose of fantasy woven into a book of historical fiction i have trouble with both fantasy and mystery novels maybe you love them (i would have preferred that the diamond was woven into the story as one of the objects stolen by the nazis) 
 let's look at how the book portrays ww2 it is set primarily in brittany france and germany and a little bit in russia and vienna its primary focus is about what warfare does to people not the leaders but normal people i liked that you saw into the heads and felt the emotions of both germans and french some of the germans are evil but you also come to understand how living in those times shaped you to stand up against the nazi regime was almost impossible there are some who try these events are gripping you also get the feel of life in brittany versus paris they are not the same i enjoyed the feel of the air the wind in my face and the salty tang on my lips in st malo i do wonder to what extent my appreciation of brittany as a place is more due to my own time there or the author's writing am i remembering my own experiences or am i seeing it from the words of the author i am unsure about this 
 in any case i was very disturbed by the blend of fantasy with gripping ww2 events 
 the events of ww2 are those portrayed in every book if you have read about ww2 in numerous other books of fiction or non-fiction you will not get much new rape by russians felt like the author had to include this simply so it could be to be togged off his checklist i do think the book moves the reader on an emotional level you get terribly angry and shocked and this is achieved through the author's writing his excellent prose 
 and this is what saves the book - its prose the descriptions of things and places the particular grip of a hand movement of a body and what characters say very good writing beautiful writing sometimes you laugh sometimes you feel that wind on your skin or the touch of a shell against your fingertips or smile at the oh so recognizable words of a child children often see far more than adults but they also talk in a clear simple manner what they say is to the point - could that diamond be thrown away of course not as remarked by one of the french children ""who is going to chuck into the seine a stone worth several eiffel towers"" even if the gem has dangerous powers 
 people love reading about kids and one of them here is blind who wouldn't be moved by such 
 the narration by zach appelman didn't add much but neither did it terribly detract from the story i appreciated how he read some lines with a beat a rhythm which matched the cadence of the author's words pauses were well placed french pronunciation was lacking 
 oh my once i got going i told you what i felt i believe this book will be popular and many will like it but it was just ok for me there is little that freaks me out more than the holocaust and i'm not belittling it at all with the phrase 'freaks me out' growing up in the 1970s and 80s i felt sufficiently desensitized enough by television violence to be able to gauge how often i need to shake the jiffy pop and run to the bathroom before the program/violence resumes 
 elie wiesel's night brings me back to my senses makes me hate the cold hearted bitch i've learned to be and not by some overtly dramatic rendition of the horrors of life in a concentration camp but more of the lack of it the down to the nitty gritty telling of what happened during the year that he was imprisoned it wasn't going for the kick to the gut reaction more of a confused inconceivable retelling of day to day events and this---this--- is what really makes me shudder and be at a loss for words hell words who am i kidding try coherent thought i have this terrible dreary feeling in my diaphragm area this morning and i'm not positive what it's about but i blame some of it on this book which i am not going to finish i have a friend who is mad at me right now for liking stupid stuff but the thing is that i do like stupid stuff sometimes and i think it would be really boring to only like smart things what i don't like is when smart (or even middle-brained) writers take an important topic and make it petty through guessing about what they don't know i can list you any number of these writers who would be fine if they weren't reaching into topics about which they have no personal experience (incidentally all writers i'm pretty sure my angry friend loves for example the lovely bones the kite runner water for elephants memoirs of a geisha etc) these are the books for which i have no patience topics that maybe someone with more imagination or self-awareness could have written about compassionately without exploiting the victimization of the characters they're books that hide lazy writing behind a topic you can't criticize the help is one of these 
 you've got this narrative telephone game in this book the telephone game is pretty fun sometimes and it is really beautiful in monster stories like frankenstein and wuthering heights because what they are telling me is not intended as trustworthy or earnest all of the seriousness in monster stories is an impression or an emotion reflected back through the layers of narrative i don't feel that way about the topic of the help though in this book a white woman writes from the point of view of a black woman during the civil rights movement who overhears the conversations of white women it's an important topic and i don't want to hear it through untrustworthy narrators 
 so i can basically get on board with the dialect of the black maids but what throws me off as a reader is when the black maid is quoting the white women and they're all speaking perfect english without a trace of an accent it becomes particularly weird when one of the black maids starts to comment on the extreme accent of one of the white women celia foote whose written dialogue continues to be impeccable who is this narrator why does she choose not to speak proper english if she can speak it why does she choose to give proper english to someone else who she has told me doesn't speak it also usually the layers of narration in a telephone-game book are only within the book in this case it's the author's voice stabbing through the story i am convinced it is her whose brain hears the white woman speaking tv english and the black women speaking in dialect it gives away the game 
 even the quotes from the movie have an example of this a conversation between her and minnie goes like this: 
 celia foote: they don't like me because of what they think i did 
 minny jackson: they don't like you 'cause they think you white trash 
 celia speaks in a proper sentence but minny misses the ""are"" in the second part of the sentence celia says ""because"" but minny says ""'cause"" if the reader were supposed to understand that celia does not speak in dialect that would make sense but since it specifically states that she does it doesn't make sense 
 to attempt to be clear i didn't have a problem that the book was in dialect i had a problem that the book said ""this white woman speaks in an extreme dialect"" and then wrote the woman's dialog not in dialect aerin points out in message 111 that i am talking about eye dialect which is about spelling not pronunciation as in the example above everyone in real life speaks in some form of non-standard english though i have seen some really beautiful uses of eye dialect as aerin points out writers typically use it to show subservience of characters or that they are uneducated which often has racist overtones if it troubles you that i'm saying this and you would like to comment on this thread you may want to read other comments because it is likely someone has already said what you are going to say 
 i'm not finishing this one and it's not because i think people shouldn't like it but rather because i'm almost 100 pages in and i can see the end and it's failed to engage me when a few irl friends have asked what i thought of the book and i said i didn't care for it they have told me that i am taking it too seriously that it is just a silly fluff book not a serious study of civil rights again i don't have a problem with stupid books but when it's a stupid book disguised as an important work of cultural history all i want to do the whole time is tear its mask off and a book about civil rights is always important cultural history to me anyway the book becomes unpleasant; i become unpleasant; it's bad news if you loved this book though (or really even if you hated it) i would recommend coming of age in mississippi i think that book is one of the more important records of american history plus it's beautifully written inspirational and shocking it's been years since i read it so i might be giving it an undeserved halo but i can't say enough good things about it

 ""authors can write outside of their personal experiences"": comments 569 through 587 this book even though at times difficult to read due to the subject matter of the holocaust (and it continuing) was an exceptional read highly recommend truly unique it's pride and prejudice for socialists mara wilson is a delightful storyteller i felt like she wrote this book just for me and i cried a lot while i was reading it 
 but you don't need to be an adrift adult who was a famous kid (like me) to fall in love with her stories and the people in them mara is almost 20 years younger than me but the stories she told about growing up weird sensitive and filled with anxiety could have come from my own childhood -- and that doesn't even take into account the whole famous child actor thing 
 i literally just finished where am i now and i have a lot of feelings that i need to process i suspect i'll be processing them for awhile because that's what a good book written by a talented author will do to a person fyh frq kbyr m byn n tqr' ktb wykwn kwys y`tyk sh`wr jyd w hssys jyd@ yjby@

 ynsh bh bshd@ the light between oceans is an incredibly moving novel about what happens when good people make bad decisions the story takes place in the town of point partageuse australia during the 1920s the story begins when a light house keeper and his wife find a life boat containing a live baby (and dead man) on the shore of their isolated island through a mixture of misplaced intentions and unsupported superstition they decide to raise the child as their own -- deciding not to inform the authorities of the child's existence 
 although the book was a quick read i never once felt that it was forced or lacking in anyway the plot is compact -- never wavering from its central theme i enjoy this kind of focused writing irrelevant or distracting side plots would have pulled me away from tom and isabel's narrative and weakened my investment in their turmoil 
 the story is highly emotional stedman crafts a perfectly gray scenario that forces its readers to question their own moral standing this truly is reader manipulation at its most powerful allowing the reader to sympathize with morally ambiguous characters is a difficult task however stedman presents her narrative in such a way that the reader can't help feeling the same inner conflict as tom and isabel 
 considering this is stedman's first published novel i am incredibly excited to see what she produces next this was a masterpiece in storytelling my love for jenny lawson is not at all creepy 
 jenny lawson i wanna make you blts and braid your hair i am really shitty at braiding and my fingers will be covered in mayonnaise after making you all those blts so it will probably get a little messy and crazy but it's the thought that counts and since your book is basically a manifesto of owning one's messy and crazy bits and alchemizing* them into comedy gold we should be all set 
 this book is a little more personal that let's pretend this never happened: a mostly true memoir; a little more serious that's not to say i didn't bust out into indelicate snort-guffaws many times while reading this because i totally did but in between all the laughter there's a lot of brave and honest stuff about managing mental and physical illness through anecdotes that are not at all humorous 
 and none of that is a criticism - i think it's astonishing how well she is able to write about her own obstacles; how clear-eyed she is in describing the debilitating emotional symptoms of disorders impossible for people who aren't fellow-sufferers to understand while offering a platitude-free example to those who are that yeah you can live through this shit 
 she'd probably hate it that i'm calling her brave but she is it's not easy to share this much of yourself and unleash it into the world to complete strangers and while i'm not on any medication nor am i seeing a therapist i still recognize a lot of myself in her stories and maybe i'm not brave enough to elaborate on that or maybe i'm just not comfortable suggesting that my problems are in any way comparable to hers but i know a lot of people who will see themselves in this book and that it will help them and make them laugh in equal parts and i'm sure doctors would disagree with the adage that laughter is the best medicine but it's not the worst the worst is that antidepressant they advertise on teevee with the disclaimer about its side effects including depression and thoughts of suicide because how is that helpful 
 so while it feels strange to say about a book so full of voodoo vaginas dead raccoon rodeos and japanese toilets - this is an important book it just also happens to be really fucking funny 
 her late-night musings 
 if you put a bunch of chameleons on top of a bunch of chameleons on top of a bowl of skittles what would happen is that science because if so i finally get why people want to do science 
 the wisdom she learned from her father 
 you don't have to go to some special private school to be an artist just look at the intricate beauty of cobwebs spiders make them with their butts 
 her assessment of australia 
 people warned us that everything in australia wants to kill you but i think they're overreacting australia doesn't want to kill you it's more like an exclusive club for people who care very little about being alive australia is really a lot like texas if texas were mad at you and drunk and maybe had a knife 
 and her scoffing at bruce springsteen dismissing him as ""obviously not the boss of scientific accuracy"" 
 i mean he's probably never even conducted any chameleon/skittles experiments 
 but it's her tales about how unfit she is for the adult world that were the most dangerous to my tendency to laugh-pee particularly the chapter that involves her meeting with maury the financial planner and victor - aka mister jenny lawson 
 maury asked me if i had life insurance and i assured him that i didn't because i didn't want victor to be arrested there was a pause in the conversation 
 ""she thinks life insurance is only taken out on people about to be murdered"" victor explained stoically 
 poor victor 
 victor sighed but frankly i'm not really sure what he'd expected it was my job to accidentally make money and his job to make sure that i didn't lose it when i was doing wobbly cartwheels in the parking lot after the bars closed our roles had been clearly defined 
 poor victor 
 ""we can come back to wills later how about retirement plans"" 
 victor spent the next several minutes speaking in a combination of words and letters that i'm pretty sure means ""i have a retirement plan and it's quite good"" 
 maury looked at me expectantly 
 ""i have a drawer i put change into"" 
 victor put his head in his hands 
 ""not quarters though i use those for gum"" 
 poor victor 
 all of this seems entirely sensible to me and familiar i don't like dealing with forms and grown-up things either and i like gum and cartwheels 
 poor victor also has to deal with her clutter of dead animals her plans for a living cat/tax write-off called ""the president"" and her delightfully irrepressible spirit as the book's cover-model rory the raccoon sneaks up over victor's shoulder during business-related skype calls 
 lucky victor 
 i want a rory photobombing me too 
 oh dreams do come true 
 i just fucking love her - the parts where i can nod along: her boredom with financial matters her fear not of flying but of getting to the plane her anxiety over small talk and hiding when the doorbell rings her love of cheese despite being lactose intolerant and also the parts where i may not be able to relate but i want to bake her a pie and try to make things better for her 
 although it seems as though she is finding her strength all on her own 
 you learn to appreciate the fact that what drives you is very different from what you're told should make you happy you learn that it's okay to prefer your personal idea of heaven (live-tweeting zombie movies from under a blanket of kittens) rather than someone else's idea that fame/fortune/parties are the pinnacle we should all reach for and there's something surprisingly freeing about that 
 it is an amazing gift to be able to recognize that the things that make you the happiest are so much easier to grasp than you thought there is such freedom in being able to celebrate and appreciate the unique moments that recharge you and give you peace and joy sure some people want red carpets and paparazzi turns out i just want banana popsicles dipped in malibu rum it doesn't mean i'm a failure at appreciating the good things in life it means i'm successful in recognizing what the good things in life are for me 
 but this is a jenny lawson book and i'm not going to close a review with something sedate and rational like that should i quote a portion from her one-night-stand with a sleep clinic or from the story containing the frantic exclamation i've swallowed a leprechaun and it's eating its way out of my chest or her realization that everything in the world either is or isn't pandas 
 no i will quote a passage from the appendix which in the jennyverse is located in the middle of the book 
 i realize that it's weird that this appendix is in the middle of the book instead of at the end where appendixes are supposed to be but it works better here and technically your appendix is in the middle of your body so it sort of makes sense probably god had the same issue when adam was like ""i don't want to sound ungrateful but it sort of hurts when i walk is that normal is this thing on my foot a tumor"" and god was like ""it's not a tumor that's your appendix appendixes go at the end read a book dude"" then adam was all ""really because i don't want to second-guess you but it seems like a design flaw also that snake in the garden told me it doesn't even do anything"" and god shook his head and muttered ""jesus that fucking snake is like tmz"" and then adam was like ""who's jesus"" and god said ""no one yet it's just an idea i'm throwing around"" and then god zapped adam's appendix off his foot and stuck it in adam's midsection instead in case he decided to use it later but the next day adam probably asked for a girlfriend and god was like ""it's gonna cost you a rib"" and adam was all ""don't i need those can't you just make her out of my appendix"" and the snake popped out and hissed ""seriously why are you so attached to this appendix idea don't those things occasionally explode for no reason whatsoever"" and god was like ""this is none of your business jefferson i'm starting to question why i even made you"" and adam was like ""wait what they explode"" and god was all ""i'm not negotiating with you adam"" and that's why appendixes go in the middle and should probably be removed 
 when i die i am leaving my body to jenny lawson and she can stuff it and do whatever she wants with it hopefully it will involve wings 
 maggie gets into it 
 sort of 
 * j-law's not the only one who can make up words i wanted to savour this one word for word towles bestows on us a language to be treasured; a story to be remembered 
 this was a remarkably enchanting narrative with a charming character a gentleman rostov has been put under hotel arrest for the next several years as he serves his time relationships are cultivated from employees to guests to the visitors he receives and to a young girl whom he becomes a guardian for 
 very descriptive - i tasted almost every meal he ate - from the crisp and tartness of an apple; to the bitterness of his coffee this is a man who truly separated himself from others in appreciating the simple things in life a man who was duly present authentic and honourable 
 this is a story that should be read with a good bottle of brandy or simply with the purist adoration for a storyteller who can transcend time and magically entrance us bravo towles bravo i bequeath a 5 star warning: this review will be lengthy due to pure hatred 
 did i ever tell you that i've got a time machine there was a freak accident where my laptop and my lawn mower got fused together following a lightning strike and now i can use it to travel in time it's a long story anyhow when i have a chance i take the occasional trip through history recently i popped into london in 1940 during the blitz to take a look around it's a fascinating time with england hanging on by its fingernails during nightly bombings and waiting for a german invasion that seemed certain 
 i was getting ready to return to 2010 and started firing up the time-mower when suddenly three people two women and a man ran up excitedly and started wildly shouting questions at me 
 ""are you from the retrieval team"" 
 ""where is your drop"" 
 ""what took you so long"" 
 after a few minutes they finally calmed down enough to introduce themselves they were polly eileen and mike they saw me with the time-mower and figured out i was from the future they demanded to know from when 
 ""my name's kemper i'm from 2010"" i told them 
 ""oh no"" polly wailed ""you're not from oxford"" 
 ""uh no i'm from kansas"" i replied 
 ""so you're not a historian from 2060 like us"" mike demanded 
 ""nope you guys are from 2060 that's incredible what's it like"" i asked 
 ""well it used to be grand we got assignments to go back and observe points in history by going undercover to live and work during these times"" eileen said 
 ""that sounds like it would be a really exciting adventure"" i said 
 ""no it's awful"" eileen said ""you see something terrible has happened we each had different assignments i was working with evacuated children in the country mike was supposed to observe the ships returning from the rescue of the british army at dunkirk and polly was going to work as a shop girl at one of the department stores"" 
 ""what happened"" 
 ""well first my assignment was terrible the english lady i worked for made us do all this extra war work while she wouldn't lift a finger and i had to deal with all these children there was this brother and sister alf and binnie that were always getting into mischief and causing me problems then there was measles outbreak so i was quarantined for months with the kids so i was long overdue when the quarantine finally lifted my drop wasn't working you see the drops are the spots where we can go back to oxford in 2060"" eileen said 
 ""yes and my drop isn't work either i got a job at a department store just as planned but when i tried to check in it isn't working"" polly said 
 ""is your drop not working"" i asked mike 
 ""we're not sure see i was supposed to arrive in dover but there was slippage that's when we don't arrive exactly when and where we were supposed to so i ended up 30 miles away in this little village and three days late a lot of stuff happened after i met commodore harold and it was months before i got back to my drop and now there are always people around it they won't open if anyone from this time frame can see it"" mike said 
 ""who is commodore harold"" 
 ""he was this old man at the village i was trying to get him to take me in his boat to dover because i had already missed part of the evacuation but he wouldn't listen to me and kept insisting that he was going to dunkirk then i fell asleep on his boat and he took me there which was terrible because i probably changed history and now we'll lose the war"" mike said tears came out of the corners of his eyes 
 ""we can't change history"" polly said 
 ""yes we can i did"" mike cried 
 ""you don't know that"" eileen said 
 ""yes i do it's all my fault"" he said and sobbed harder 
 ""well if you think you had it bad i had a terrible time getting a black skirt"" polly said 
 ""a black skirt"" i asked in confusion 
 ""yes shop girls must wear a black skirt and everything was confused at oxford when we were leaving because of schedule changes so wardrobe could only get me a dark blue one i got the job but the woman in charge would fire me if i didn't get a black skirt and i kept trying to get back to the drop so i could go back to oxford and get one but i kept getting delayed when i finally got there the drop wasn't working plus i couldn't wrap the packages properly so i had to spend ever so much time practicing it"" polly said her lip quivered slightly as she remembered the horror of wrapping packages 
 ""uh didn't they give you any money when you came to the past"" i asked 
 ""oh yes tons of it"" polly said 
 ""and you were working in a department store"" i said 
 ""yes"" 
 ""so why didn't you just buy a black skirt there instead of spending all that effort trying to time travel to go home and get one"" i said polly only looked at me blankly 
 ""i had problems too i tried and tried to get out of the quarantine and sneak back to the drop but mr samuels locked the doors"" eileen said 
 ""who is mr samuels a cop or doctor"" i asked 
 ""no just the old gardener at the estate"" she said 
 ""i had a lot of bother getting a newspaper"" mike volunteered 
 ""a newspaper"" i asked 
 ""yes i had to spend some time in a hospital and i wanted to see the war news to see what i had changed but the nurses thought it was making me too upset so i had to pretend that i wanted to do the crosswords so they'd leave me the paper"" mike said proudly 
 ""ok forget about the skirt and the quarantine and the newspaper don't you people have some kind of back-up plan if something went wrong and you couldn't get to your drops"" i asked 
 ""yes the retrieval teams"" they shouted in unison 
 ""i was sure that you were with the retrieval team"" polly said 
 ""i've spent so many hours wondering what was keeping my retrieval team"" eileen said 
 ""i'm sure that my retrieval team hasn't been able to locate me"" mike said 
 ""where oh where could our retrieval teams be"" polly said 
 ""i thought mike and polly were my retrieval team when they found me"" eileen said 
 ""and i thought mike was my retrieval team"" polly said 
 ""i know that you two are women and all that but the next person to say 'retrieval team' is getting punched in the throat"" i said ""ok so those retre er people were supposed to come and get you if something went wrong but they haven't shown so what was your plan b"" 
 ""plan b"" eileen said 
 ""yeah for if something really went wrong and they couldn't find you or whatever didn't you have a pre-determined spot to meet out some time later or since all you people were running around this time did they set up some kind of safe-house you could go to in case of emergency"" 
 ""that's a good idea"" polly said 
 ""we'll have to tell mr dunworthy that we should do that after the retrieval team ow takes us back"" mike said 
 ""so no plan other than just sitting around fretting and speculating about what happened since you're worried that they can't find you have you put an ad in the paper or anything"" i asked 
 ""oh i checked the personals to see if the retrieval teamowplaced an ad trying to find us i thought about putting an ad in so that they could find me but haven't done it yet"" mike said proudly 
 ""uh you guys do research in the future before you go into the past right"" 
 ""of course"" polly said 
 ""that would include reading newspapers"" 
 ""yes we get a lot of information from newspapers"" eileen said 
 ""and it's never occurred to any of you that if you put a message in that says something like 'hey oxford 2060 come pick me up at noon outside buckingham palace on oct 1' that they might see it and meet you there then"" i asked 
 ""that's another good idea"" eileen said ""you've got a knack for this kemper"" 
 ""are you kidding me you're goddamn time travelers and you never thought of doing that or leaving a letter with a lawyer for delivery to oxford in 2060 haven't you ever seen the back to the future movies or that episode of quantum leap where sam and al switched places"" i said 
 ""well i'm not sure that it's a matter of oxford not being able to find us i think something went wrong and that they can't come back for some reason"" polly said 
 ""it's my fault"" mike shrieked 
 ""oh do shut up"" polly snapped ""even before we left something was going on mr dunworthy was changing assignments like mad and they were having a terrible time finding drop sites and they were very worried about us reporting any slippage"" 
 ""that's true"" mike said ""mr dunworthy changed my assignment from pearl harbor to dunkirk so i had almost no time to prepare and polly couldn't get the right clothes and eileen had a hard time getting the driving lessons she needed"" 
 ""so this mr dunworthy is a douche bag that sends you guys into the past with no preparation"" i said 
 ""oh no he cares about us ever so much he sets very strict rules about where we can live and work in the past and if there's so much of a hint of danger he'll pull us right off an assignment he'd send a retrieval team owin a second if he knew we were in trouble"" eileen said confidently 
 i sighed and rubbed my temples for a couple of minutes then i took a deep breath 
 ""let me see i've got this straight you're all historians from 2060 at oxford who work for a guy named dunworthy who is supposedly very strict about your safety yet he did a last minute change of schedule with no explanation that left people going to england in 1940 unprepared and ill-equipped for the assignment you were stupid enough to come anyhow and you're all seemingly incapable of dealing with anything as mundane as unruly children or overbearing people plus the simplest task like obtaining a black skirt or a newspaper turns into a major undertaking for you even outwitting a senile boat captain or a gardner was beyond your abilities now something has gone wrong and your only plan is to sit around whining about your 'retrieval teams' is that about it"" i said 
 ""yes that's about the size of it"" mike said 
 ""please kemper we really need your help"" polly said 
 ""well you all may be morons but it's your lucky day because a guy with a time-mower showed up i guess i can't leave you here"" i said 
 ""that's wonderful so you'll take a message to oxford"" eileen said 
 ""a message"" i asked 
 ""yes we'll write a message to mr dunworthy and you can take it to him then he'll send a retrieval teamowback for us"" polly said 
 they just kept grinning and smiling at me as i looked at them in disbelief 
 ""guy with a working time machine standing right here"" i said slowly 
 they nodded 
 ""and all you want me to do is to take a message to the future for you"" 
 they nodded 
 ""not you know just take you to oxford in 2060"" 
 ""oh no"" mike said ""what if we left and the retrieval teamowshows up"" 
 ""changed my mind not doing shit for you sit here and wait hopefully the germans will drop a bomb on your stupid wussy worthless whining asses see ya in hell"" i said as i fired up the time-mower and started to fade away 
 the last thing i heard before leaving 1940 was ""when do you think the retrieval team will arrive"" 
 in summary of a shitty book 
 i have never been subjected to such painful characters in my life all three of the major players are exactly the same almost the entire book is their inner dialogues which consist solely of fretting about stupid trivial crap wild speculation that turns out to be completely wrong and repeatedly asking ""oh when will the retrieval team arrive"" 
 you'd think that time travelers should be hardy adventurers with the ability to improvise and adapt to problems these dumbasses can't complete the simplest of tasks without it becoming a story of epic proportions seriously the first chapter of this book is a guy trying to find dunworthy at oxford and having all these internal discussions with himself about where he might be where he should look for him what his secretary will say blah blah blah blah blah someone please shoot me the rest of the book consists of characters doing pretty much the same thing 
 even worse this is the first of two books so even after reading all this drivel you don't get any resolution to the story 
 when i'm on my deathbed i'll be cursing the name of connie willis for writing this piece of shit and tricking me into wasting precious hours of my life i wanted to like this book i wish i could enjoy it i bought it with such enthusiasm and couldn't wait to start reading it but alas i sensed almost at the very start that it wasn't going to be a happy relationship - a point confirmed by mid-way through the book 
 the length the repetitive scenes the incredible number of times ursula dies and is reborn are all tedious and terrible torment to get through 2/3rds in i found myself offended for having my time wasted surely atkinson could show the courtesy of not subjecting her readers to so many repetitive scenarios 
 i cannot fault atkinson's writing nor do i have any particular dislike for her characters (i rather liked izzy the best) but the plot lost my interest fairly early on and by the end i positively wanted to hurl it at a wall (i didn't i'm rather fond of my walls) 
 my apologies for offending anyone with this review i understand our tastes are subjective and many simply adore this book but i'm not one of them i expected this book to be witty i expected it to be clever and fun and it was it was all of those things in spades 
 but i didn't expect it to be sweet and sad and honest and touching i mean it's framed as a choose-your-own-adventure you don't expect those to be heartfelt emotional stories 
 perhaps i should start by saying that i came to know neil patrick harris in a different way than people most of you probably know him from his two big tv shows: doogie howser or how i met your mother 
 not so with me i was aware of those shows even watched them but i came to appreciate harris by watching undercover brother later my admiration grew when i saw him play a deranged version of himself in harold and kumar and last i came to love him through dr horrible's sing-along blog 
 oddly enough it was the last of these that shot my respect for his craft as an actor through the roof (and to tangent briefly still makes me think he would do a great job of playing bast should my books ever make it to the screen) 
 i mention this to let you know that i came at this book as a fan but not as your typical sort of fan 
 so the book simply said i loved it as i mentioned above it was everything i expected and more it was funny enough to make my laugh out loud more than once and sweet enough to make me cry on an airplane twice 
 specific things i enjoyed: 
 i liked that he spoke frankly about how he came to grips with the fact that he was gay as well as the conflict of coming out publicly it was extraordinary insightful 
 there are little pieces of the book written by various celebrities harris has interacted with over the years penn jillette sarah silverman etc etc these were lovely quirky additions to the book 
 what's more the choose-your-own-adventure aspect worked remarkably well at first i thought it was just a gimmick but i quickly learned this is a great format for an autobiography as it gave me the chance to skip to the parts of the book i was most interested in then later on i went back and read it again 
 simply said it was a great book it's the only autobiography i'd be tempted to read again in the future and it's only one i've ever considered buying multiple copies of as a christmas gifts 
 lastly speaking as a writer it was irritatingly well written it just doesn't doesn't seem fair that harris should be able to sing dance act and write this well some books give young girls dreams of ponies kittens and visions of eternal love this book is not one of them 
 if i were to make a metaphor this book would be the equivalent of the ice bucket challenge it offers no platitudes it is harsh realistic it slaps you in the face with reality a reality that is very rarely pleasant 
 and it is also one of the best young adult books i have ever read 
 i first read this book as a young teen perhaps when i was 13 or 14 the main lesson i learned from it: life is not fair life is hard life is harsh people suffer good things do not come to those who wait even if you're the best person in the world life can still slap you in the face and you can only take what fate has handed you 
 even if you strive to be the best child you can be to your parents they can still show favoritism to your younger sibling for no reason than the fact that your younger sibling was determined through some undetermined reason to be superior parents can and will play favorites despite your best efforts 
 even if your mother works her hands to the bone to support you and your brother you will secretly love your wastrel drunkard of a father more for unfathomable reasons because human nature doesn't always make sense and you can't help who you love 
 even if you're committed to common sense you will have your heart broken people can and will take advantage of you no matter how much you try to guard yourself 
 this book is a bleak one it is about a young girl named frannie a child born of desperately poor parents a quiet child a shy child one who takes comfort in books i think we can all relate to that a girl mature beyond her years due to the hardships of the poor brooklyn life in which she grew up but a girl who is naive all the same 
 she knew her family was poor but little children never notice much of that her mother has to stretch a loaf of bread over an entire week but there is magic in how she does it so that there is variety in their meals she takes joy in playing with her brother in getting a few pennies to buy a bit of candy at the dime store in buying a pickle and reveling in the sourness of it simple joys that only children know it is not until later in life that reality becomes all too clear 
 her neighbors are vibrant colorful above all they are people they are human this may be a silly thing to note but not all books are about people not all books have humans that seem human too many books have characters who are little more than typescript on a page the people in this book seem alive from the grumpy old man who yells at her down the street to the sadly tragic woman who enters into a costume competition---and wins---for wearing what judges feel to be a symbolic dress with just one arm not realizing that she is too poor to afford both sleeves and the one arm is from a salvaged outfit 
 if you wanted a true portrait of the people of brooklyn in the early 20th century you will find no better depiction in this book 
 no this book doesn't offer any rainbows there are no daydreams not all little girls need constant beauty and joy and complacency all girls however need a good dose of reality they need to know that they too can survive and thrive despite what life throws at them 
 because if a girl like frannie can survive like a blade of grass sprouting from the hard concrete of brooklyn so can they man this book chills i tell you everywhere chills this is a companion book to life after life and technically it is ""teddy's story"" teddy you will recall from life is ursula's little brother if you have not read life after life - what the crap is wrong with you go read meet us back here when you're done 
 i say ""technically"" because although teddy is definitely the center of this book we are still treated to the stories and perspectives of some of our other friends from life as well as some new additions: sylvie izzie nancy hugh sunny viola bertie and just a dash of ursula who does not spend this book dying on every other page lucky girl 
 the two things about life that resonated with me long after i closed the book had nothing to do with its structural playfulness which seems to be ""the thing"" about the book that most people wanna talk about and it should be talked about because it was risky and well-handled but for me that was more or less cosmetic the things that shattered me were her writing about war and her glorification of english stoicism and while this book doesn't have the same structure as life it most definitely has these two focal points 
 and they are just as good here as they were in life i'm not big into wartime narratives but atkinson has a gift she takes the english experience during world war two and just dissects the crap out of it whether it be in long chapters about teddy's experiences as a fighter pilot (sometimes too long which is my sole complaint about this book but that complaint is tied to my own tastes which balked at the very detailed descriptions of planes which are no doubt fascinating to people with an interest in military history) or in smaller stories about the way the war changed people - their sexual permissiveness social restructuring and - my second - that stiff upper lip 
 if you're reading this review you probably know me and know my tastes and a lot of what i enjoy from steinbeck to hardy to grit lit are stories of endurance and adaptability in unforgiving circumstances the triumph of the human spirit and man's struggle against forces of nature and hardship &yada and this entire book is resting on the sturdy foundation of stoic forbearance on doing what needs to be done on making do and not making a fuss 
 a perfect example of this: 
 it was when she had come down from the walls at monkgate bar and was waiting to cross the road at the traffic lights that a black curtain suddenly descended and covered her left eyeif she had gone completely blind she would have called for help but the loss of only one eye didn't seem cause enough to involve complete strangers 
 i mean come on that is stellar 
 and also: 
  instead he had stayed and plodded on because something told him that this was the life that had to be lived outhe preferred solitary pursuits and being a member of a group seemed rather dutiful but he could do dutiful and somebody had to or the world would fall apart 
 and the book is just filled with that same as in life and it is also filled with stories stories stories each one a soulhurting gem three words: dominic 
 i said that the book wasn't as structurally playful as life but it does do a couple of things we bounce around back and forth in time and voice: prewar wartime postwar post-post war with an overarching omniscient narrator casually inserting facts and fates that will happen in the future which may or may not be fleshed out in later chapters details will occur and then recur in a different context with different import we will revisit meaningful objects through the eyes of several characters who may not know what they are looking at oh and there's this one other thing about which you will hear nothing from me except that it's more reader-jarring than anything that happens in life 
 don't read too many reviews of this book i have been careful but others may not be go in cold and prepare to be blown away again by this woman's phenomenal storytelling abilities and her ability to write characters for whom you will care very deeply and fear for because we are at war and you can be killed while sunbathing on a roof 
 please more ms atkinson jimmy izzie maurice anyone 
  
 this is only a four-star from me because it is not quite as good as life after life which is like saying camembert is not quite as good as brie it's practically a meaningless distinction as i would eat either of those anytime anywhere for all intents and purposes this is a five-star book it should never be forgotten 
 by sol tetelbaum 
 review: sarah's key by tatiana de rosnay 
 almost a hundred readers published their reviews on tatiana de rosnay's novel sarah's key most of them rated the book in four or five stars but some of them calling the novel ""mediocre"" showed a lower rating - three stars it is necessary to admit that their opinions weren't unfounded and most critical comments were fair however from my standpoint despite the fair critical comments (i don't think it is necessary to list them) the novel deserves a rather high rating and i will try to explain why 
 the book is devoted to the holocaust the author describes two stories one story is about the tragedy of a jewish girl named sarah the story is based on historical fact in 1942 on the orders of german military authorities french police brutally arrested all jewish families in paris almost all of them perished in concentration camps 
 the second parallel story is about an american journalist julia jermond who writing an article about vel' d'hiv's roundup found out many horrible details of this crime committed by french police france wanted to forget about its anti-human past and thoroughly concealed it the author reminds us of those tragic facts i am not going to retell the stories they are already well known but the book gave birth to some of my thoughts 
 in her novel the author writes with anxiety and great concern that people want to forget about the holocaust one character of the book says: ""bringing back the past is never a good idea especially whatever happened during the war no one wants to be reminded of that nobody wants to think about that"" the book demonstrates that such amnesia can be deadly 
 for a long time naive people believed that the world moves in the direction of higher level of humanization in their naivety they missed the point when one of the most horrible and bloodthirsty variety of anthropoids (resembling humans) became active russian anthropoids captured power in the soviet russia invented concentration camps and killing over a million innocent people yearly over a period of 20 years they killed at least 20 million maybe more then world war ii broke out and the world forgot about the 20 million innocent victims 
 humanlike anthropoids appeared in other countries and people continued to believe that they were ordinary criminals people's beliefs melted like a piece of paper in acid when the terrifying truth about fascist factories of deaths became known people couldn't believe what they learned using modern technology fascist anthropoids made the killing of humans a branch of industry for human beings the holocaust is impossible to understand it is just unexplainable and the only way to prevent it from happening again is to never forget it 
 the reviewed book is multidimensional emotionally written but unfortunately as it has been mentioned in some reviews it has weak points as well nevertheless i was impressed with the book its main message makes the readers think and this is a sign of good literature the advantage of the book is in the strong civic position of the author that i think has made the book a bestseller 
 this book is about events which were not wide-known; it reminds people about the necessity to be alert otherwise the modern anthropoids will commit a new holocaust and now all people can become their victims they already are trying to convince us that there is nothing to remember; there wasn't a holocaust at all 
 in general the book is well written and author's voice is strong in my opinion the book deserves not less than four stars 
 everybody who cares about human life who reads books not just for entertainment will read this book with interest and will continue to return to it in his/her mind

 there are many reviews already of this book and i did wonder whether the world needed any more but i disagree so strongly with some of the opinions expressed that i'm afraid i have to exercise my right to reply two things in particular stand out 
 let me deal with the simpler one first some people seem appalled that the author is putting the guilt for this dreadful tragedy on the shoulders of a young girl she didn't know what she was doing they say; she was too young to understand the import of her actions and we shouldn't hold her responsible well it seems to me that this is completely beside the point the novel we finally learn has been written by the girl herself she's giving herself the blame for what happened she's evidently spent her whole life wondering why she behaved the way she did and she still doesn't really know she's just trying to get the story as straight as she can mainly so that she can understand it herself and i found her efforts extremely moving if anyone is claiming that people don't behave this way all i can say is that their view of human nature is so different from mine that it'll be hard to have a meaningful conversation on the subject 
 so now the second and more controversial part many reviewers dislike the post-modernist aspects they complain that mcewan is taking a perverse pleasure in tricking the reader into a view of the story which is finally revealed as incorrect; that he's playing the unreliable narrator card out of sheer willfulness again i completely disagree i don't think these aspects of the book are irrelevant or peripheral; i think they're at the very core of it and are what make it a great piece of literature mcewan shows us a girl who becomes an author precisely because she wants to expiate the dreadful feelings of guilt she has suffered all her life he lets her explain how it happened in what we eventually discover is a book within a book and the truly awful thing is that she can't do it she cops out with a fake happy ending because she still can't face what she did 
 i don't think this is a trick; i think he's saying something about the very nature of writing many many writers are like briony they write to absolve themselves of their guilt but in the end they don't say what they want to say it's too horrible to write down they skirt around the issues and end up presenting them in a more favourable light if they're lucky they may finally reach an age when they are so far removed from what happened that they can tell the story straight this is what briony does in the postscript and i don't find it far-fetched to take just one example the first i happen to think of look at marguerite duras all her life she kept thinking about her first love affair and it coloured most of what she wrote it was only when she was nearly 70 that she could set it down as l'amant 
 before the events of the fountain briony was indeed just a little girl; all she could write was the amusingly mediocre arabella afterwards she had something that was worth saying though it took a long time to figure out how to do that when she'd completed her task she was able to get back to the one she was engaged in when she was interrupted: i love the circular structure which ends with arabella being staged 60 years late of the many infuriating changes in the movie version i think i was most annoyed by the removal of this key scene 
 wood burns observes monty python's logician as he gives an example of an incorrect syllogism; therefore all that burns is wood similarly the fact that much trickery is post-modern does not imply that all post-modernism is trickery this is a great and heart-felt novel ""`zzyl ldhy sn`nh lkmn fy 'nfsn""

 i've read that outlander was originally marketed as a romance novel because the publisher didn't know what else to do with it but this book is no ordinary romance novel it doesn't follow any typical romance formula and is a real genre bender that doesn't fit neatly into any one category outlander has a swoon-worthy hero and dozens of truly romantic scenes that should be sufficient to satisfy even the most discriminating romance reader while it's time travel aspect and a few references to witches and fairies should be of interest to readers of fantasy and paranormal stories at it's heart though outlander is a historical novel rife with details of 18th century life in the scottish highlands both inside and outside a castle or large estate it also recounts some of the events leading up to the jacobite pretender's uprising of 1745 diana gabaldon is an amazing writer who delves deep into her character's lives and the history surrounding them painting an extraordinary picture that truly transports the reader to another time and place 
 claire is an incredibly strong heroine who can sometimes be a bit brash and sassy but deep down she is a kind and caring person at heart she adapts amazingly well to a new time and place much better than most people ever would if faced with the dilemma she was claire is a very intelligent woman who uses every ounce of knowledge at her disposal to reverse her predicament while helping others especially with their medical needs and bringing a much needed modern perspective to ancient methods she somehow finds the courage to made difficult choices in an era when choices were sometimes few or non-existent especially for women and to do what needs to be done when it needs to be done claire is stubborn and persistent even in the face of nearly impossible odds best of all she is a pillar of strength to her beloved jamie as much as he is to her and she has a powerful underlying passion that matches his own for her 
 jamie in my opinion is the best romantic hero ever to be penned by an author he exhibits both physical and mental strength as well as a strength of character that go above and beyond any ordinary romantic hero his word is his honor and his commitment to that honor is moving beyond words if only there were more men in reality who could be so easily trusted and taken at their word jamie shows a deep respect not just for claire but for all the women with whom he comes in contact a true gentleman in every sense of the word on the outside jamie is tough as nails enduring more physical pain than any one person should ever be expected to while on the inside he is kind gentle and sensitive often instinctively knowing things that others don't he is thoroughly intelligent and well-educated and often beautifully poetic in his speech he is lighthearted and self-deprecating never taking himself too seriously i loved the way he was always teasing claire jamie is simply a wonderful character a man who loves selflessly and with his whole being 
 there is much to enjoy about this book together jamie and claire make a formidable couple and it is obvious from the outset that they are soulmates their absolute trust in each other basically from the moment they meet is in and of itself romance at it's finest there are no contrived misunderstandings between them only naked honesty which brings an openness and vulnerability to both characters that is breathtaking i love the way the author creates a beautiful friendship between these two characters before they end up at the altar and of course then become lovers what's even better though is how that friendship continues to blossom and grow deeper and deeper even after they are married the intimacy level of these two characters is something i rarely see in a novel and most of it has little or nothing to do with sexual interludes during the times when jamie and claire were apart even for short periods of time i simply couldn't wait for them to be reunited as the two of them together absolutely electrify the pages all the secondary characters are extremely well-crafted and surprisingly well fleshed out even those who play only minor parts the setting is beautifully rendered as well almost becoming a character unto itself the time travel aspect adds an extended element of intrigue and ms gabaldon has certainly taken the time to think through the ramifications of such a feat if it were indeed possible every scene simply adds to the richness of detail in the book and there is nothing that i felt was excess the author's care in seamlessly weaving all of the elements together is evident all throughout the book 
 while there are many things to love about this story there were a few events that bothered me just a bit there was a scene in which jamie beats claire with his sword belt for disobedience the scene in and of itself actually did not bother me much because i fully understood his reasons for doing so and he later took a vow never to do it again what did bother me was his admission that he enjoyed it the admission was made in a fairly lighthearted manner in light of that i suppose it might have been meant as humorous but perhaps it was too subtle for me to fully appreciate even so i might not have thought much of it except for the fact that the villain in this story is a brutal sadist for that reason i found myself a bit annoyed at having the hero of the story exhibit even a hint of such a tendency there were also a couple of scenes of what i would term rather intense and rough lovemaking one of which began with jamie behaving in a dominant manner and neither of which were quite to my taste they just seemed a bit out of character for jamie who up to this point and following was always a gentle and considerate though passionate lover i will allow though for the fact that jamie apologized for the first incident and admitted equality after the second finally there was a scene in which jamie related a prior incident with a secondary character in his youth which by today's standards would have been nothing short of an act of child molestation against him but which was treated rather casually by all involved i wanted to reconcile this in a historical perspective but as hard as i tried i simply couldn't i also feel compelled to warn sensitive readers that there is an incidence of brutal sexual violence near the end of the book it is not played out in real-time but instead is related a bit at a time through dialog and implication but still is immensely palpable in the intensity of it's aftereffects on the psyche of the character who was the victim i'm not usually overly squeamish about such things but i have to admit to having some difficulty reading these passages more than once they brought tears to my eyes 
 in spite of the things i have mentioned though outlander is still by far one of the best books i have ever read i have to give ms gabaldon extra points for all of her attention to details it is a joy to read such an intelligently-written and meticulously-researched novel that is so rich in detail it went far beyond my expectations for a debut novel for any author it even sparked my interest in learning more about the time and place that is depicted in it outlander is the type of book that is so engrossing and compelling that it makes one want to read straight through without ever putting it down though it's epic length makes that somewhat unfeasible this was my second reading of the book and it certainly won't be my last it has a earned a permanent place on my keeper shelf along with it's sequels dragonfly in amber voyager drums of autumn the fiery cross and a breath of snow and ashes all of which continue jamie and claire's story this book is two two two books in one 
 sorry that was annoying but it's almost as if erik larson wrote two really short books--one about the 1893 world's columbian exposition and another about the murder spree of dr h h holmes--and then shoved them together to create a single story the result isn't bad and i think larson is successful at maintaining clean seams between the two narratives but it's hard to argue these two occurrences are anything but abstractedly related yes holmes lived in chicago at the time of the fair and lured a bunch of people to his murder castle (he be snatchin' yo' people up) but the events didn't weigh heavily on the fair itself or on the atmosphere surrounding it no alarm bells went off anywhere in chicago as a result of his um unsavory indiscretions 
 still there is a lot of interesting stuff here information specific to the world's fair and it is fun to learn new things for example the chicago columbian exposition exudes a long list of firsts: it saw the invention of the world's first ferris wheel it led the nation in its first public observance of the pledge of allegiance and it helped to establish alternating current as the industry standard for electricity distribution even that awful snake charmer song has its origins in the chicago world's fair 
 while writing this review i've come to learn that leonardo dicaprio that beautiful man with the screaming cherry tomato head on a toothpick body is producing the film adaptation and will also play the role of serial killer h h holmes for this i am pleased in many important ways the reflections of marcus aurelius (121-180) crystallize the philosophical wisdom of the greco-roman world this little book was written as a diary to himself while emperor fighting a war out on the boarder of the roman empire and today this book is known to us as the meditations 
 the roman philosophers are not as well known or as highly regarded as greek philosophers such as plato aristotle epicurus or zeno the stoic - and for a simple reason: the roman thinkers were not primarily interested in abstract theory; rather they were concerned with behavior that is understanding how to live in the everyday world and putting their understanding into practice; the goal being to live the life of an authentic philosopher to be a person of high character and integrity to develop inner strength and a quiet mind and value such strength and quietude above all else indeed to accomplish such a lofty goal the romans realized the need for radical transformation a complete overhauling of one's life through rigorous mental and physical training like turning base metal into pure gold and once a person takes on the role of a philosopher their deeds must reflect their words - no hypocrisy thank you thus it isn't surprising the romans put a premium on memorizing and internalizing simple proverbs and maxims and employed the metaphor of philosophy as the medicine to cure a sick soul 
 turning now to marcus aurelius we can appreciate how he imbibed the wisdom not only from the stoics (along with seneca and epictetus marcus is considered one of the three major roman stoics) but he was also willing to learn from the schools of epicurus plato and aristotle in the greco-roman world being eclectic was perfectly acceptable; truth was valued over who said what 
 we find several recurring themes in the meditations: develop self-discipline to gain control over judgments and desires; overcoming a fear of death; value an ability to retreat into a rich interior mental life (one's inner citadel); recognize the world as a manifestation of the divine; live according to reason; avoid luxury and opulence but generalizations will not approach the richness and wisdom nuggets a reader will find in marcus's actual words thus i conclude with my personal observations coupled with quotes from book one wherein marcus begins by expressing heartfelt thanks to his family and teachers for the many fine lessons he learned as a youth here are four of my favorites: 
 ""not to have frequented public schools and to have had good teachers at home"" ---------- after my own nasty experience with the mindless competition and regimentation of public schools i wish i had marcus's good fortune of excellent home schooling 
 ""not to meddle with other people's affairs and not to be ready to listen to slander"" ---------- i didn't need a teacher here; i recognized on my own at an early age that gossip is a colossal waste of time and energy both listening to gossip and spreading gossip i can't imagine a clearer indication of a base coarse mind than someone inclined to gossip and slandering others 
 ""to read carefully and not to be satisfied with a superficial understanding of a book"" ---------- how true reading isn't a race to get to the last page; matter of fact i agree with jorge luis borges that focused precise rereading is the key to opening oneself to the wisdom of a book 
 ""to be satisfied on all occasions and be cheerful"" ---------- i'm never in a hurry life is too beautiful to be in a hurry for me there is only one way to live each day: in joy and free from anxiety and worry in a sense all of the meditations of marcus aurelius amplify this simple view of life 
 i've written this review as an encouragement to make marcus aurelius a part of your life you might not agree with everything he has to say but you have to admit marcus has a really cool beard and head of hair kate atkinson has written a lovely accordion-fold of a novel here 
 this is not a jackson brodie novel which are always much better than your typical detective novels (even though i haven't read the last one yet - merp) but this one is just so much more ambitious in scope and style than even those gems 
 it is sublime 
 at its most simplistic it is about ursula a character who will be born and die all in the first two pages (excluding what i am considering to be a prologue) and then again and again she will die from falling off a roof from drowning from gas-inhalation but she will be reborn again to live a collage of different lives but always as ursula and always surrounded by the same family sometimes she can remember her past go-rounds in hazy half-memories and sometimes she can remember more but this is not some hippy-dippy exploration of spiritual reincarnation i have never read a book that is more human more terrestrial it is not necessarily about ""getting it right"" although you cheer inside every time she manages to avoid the decisions that led to some of her more horrifying deaths it is more about our possible paths about family about historyit is about ripples and traps and the horrors of war 
 and oh war i have read many books about england during wartime whether it be i or ii but never have i read one with more immediacy than this one she does such a fantastic job with this particular material not just the parts that you would think i would respond to being of a ghoulish bent the ""recovery of the bodies"" scenes were very graphic and haunting and shivery yes but i found myself responding not to the shocking descriptions but more to the quieter scenes the ones which are focused on the national character during wartime 
 the englishness of this novel is just brilliant there is such a pervading sense of ""one does as one must and then one has tea"" throughout 
 on the way back from lunch sylvie said she wanted to visit oberpollingers and buy a present for hugh when they reached the department store they found the windows daubed with anti-jewish slogans and sylvie said ""gracious what a mess"" the shop was open for business but a pair of grinning louts in sa uniform were loitering in front of the doors putting people off from entering not sylvie who had marched past the brownshirts while ursula reluctantly trailed in her wake into the store and up the thickly carpeted staircase in the face of the uniforms ursula had shrugged a cartoon helplessness and murmured rather shamefacedly ""she's english"" she thought that sylvie didn't understand what it was like living in germany but in retrospect she thought that perhaps sylvie had understood very well 
 i love that passage on at least three different levels the brisk insouciance of a mother accustomed to living in an imperial nation the shame of a transplanted daughter living in a changing country whose climate she is becoming a part of but doesn't yet fully understand and the latent judgment passing as ignorance 
 and this which perfectly sums up the english spirit: 
 ""no point in thinking"" she said briskly ""you just have to get on with life we only have one after all we should try and do our best we can never get it right but we must try"" 
 i loved that about this book it is practical unhysterical perfection there is a determination to these characters in the face of horrors and lives lived always on the brink of destruction that is admirable and almost uplifting you know if it weren't for all the bombs 
 this book killed me it really did and then i was reborn as a reader it is such a labor of love; you can feel how much thought atkinson put into it with all of its carefully-sprinkled echoes from former life-plots and how lovingly-rendered are even the smallest supporting characters (mr emslie ) 
 obviously i love izzie the free-spirited drunken floozie of an aunt even though she is such a selfish character but that's kind of what this book is about - how when we are living our lives we miss a great deal of what is happening around us and if we had a chance to step back to see the bigger picture we might make different decisions and in some cases we could change the course of historywhich sounds trite but kate atkinson is a much more accomplished writer than i am and this book is an absolute triumph 
 you will have to wait until april to read this unless you are greg and are getting it friday and then it will be mailed off to canada to bill and it is a beautiful-looking arc:

 whatever you do do not read this book at work unless you want to be thought insane for bursting into laughter like all of the books in this series this story is utterly adorable never has a tale starting in blackmail been so romantic 
 yeah you heard me romantic blackmail i solemnly proclaim myself sane with a fierce hatred for assholes the love interest in this book blackmails the heroine into marriage i know that's a bad start for any tale but believe me when i say that this story was so good i assure you there is no abuse i assure you that the love interest and his motives are noble (if questionablei mean it's still blackmail) i am not a fan of assholes i assure you you will love this book 
 16-year old maddie is dreadfully shy she has a stepmother that she wishes were an evil stepmother instead lovely anne wants to dress maddie up and give her a season so maddie can find her one twoo wuv 
 an absolutely horrifying thought 
 maddie has what we would call today social anxiety disorder she is terrified of crowds she is quite accomplished as an amateur artist happiest in her own company sketching naturelike the mating rituals of a pair of lobsters lovingly named fluffy and rex so in order to avoid coming out and facing people maddie invents an imaginary lover logan mackenzie a brave brave soldier who has fallen in love with her at first sight 
 logan mackenzie suddenly her not-real suitor had a name by the end of the afternoon he had hair (brown) eyes (blue) a voice (deep with a highland burr) a rank (captain) and a personality (firm but intelligent and kind) 
 she writes letters to an imaginary lover and ships it off to god knows where 
 my dear imaginary captain mackenzie you are not real and never will be i however am a true and eternal fool 
 here have a drawing of a snail 
 after 5 years the guilt of constantly lying to her loved ones drew on her conscience and thusly maddie makes the sad decision of killing captain logan off nine years after her invention of logan 24-year old maddie is living a happy life in an inherited scottish castle when a zombie comes to the door that is logan what are the odds the real logan has been receiving and reading her letters all these years the real logan is nothing like what she imagined 
 his hair was overlong (mostly brown with hints of ginger) and his squared jaw sported several days' growth of whiskers (mostly ginger with hints of brown) broad shoulders tapered to a trim torso a simple black sporran was slung low around his waist and a sheathed dirk rode his hip below the fall of his kilt muscled hairy legs disappeared into white hose and scuffed black boots 
 he's mad he's scottish he's kilted was there ever a more terrifying combination logan didn't just show up for shits and giggles he's got a mission in mind marriage to maddie he intends to take the castle and the lands surrounding it lands so conveniently owned by maddie if she doesn't marry him he will expose her letters ridiculing her and her family maddie is unwilling to put herself and her family through that humiliationand therefore agrees to a marriage of convenience 
 but naturally all is not what it seems come on this is a romance novel logan is not a nefarious asshole he has only recently returned from the war scarred broken with his similarly battle-worn band of men they have lost their lands due to their evil english landlords logan is determined to protect his men at all cost he is their captain they've been through so much together; it is his responsibility to take care of them 
 it wasn't supposed to be this way when the regiment had landed at dover last autumn they'd been greeted as triumphant heroes in london then they'd marched north home to the highlands and he'd watched his men's lives and dreams fall apart at the seams one by one 
 callum wasn't the only one the men gathered around him represented the last of his discharged soldiers and the worst off: the homeless the wounded the left behind 
 they'd fought bravely survived battle won the war for england on the promise of coming home to their families and sweethearts--only to find their families homes and sweethearts gone pushed off the lands they'd inhabited for centuries by the same greedy english landlords who'd asked them to fight 
 and logan couldn't do a damned thing about it until today 
 naturally attraction grows between them and logan discovers that maddie is not the spoiled english heiress he'd expected she is kind caring loving to her tenants a brilliant artist a thoroughly intelligent young woman with a crippling fear of crowds which isn't to say she doesn't have her oddities 
 maddie had always been different from other girls and she had always known it for example she was certain she was the only bride to ever write the following to-do list on her wedding day: 
 *	bath 
 *	coiffure 
 *	dress 
 *	lobsters 
 and maddie realizes that---oddly enough she now has a friend 
 a realization struck her like a lightning bolt she now had a confidant a conspirator someone who knew everything all her secrets he didn't love her for them but he hadn't run screaming from her either 
 this ruthless kilted stranger she'd married might be the closest thing on earth maddie had to a true friend 
 maddie is not without guileshe is not spineless and if logan expects her to play this charade she will make him pay for itlike making him read a love poem he allegedly wrote her 
 ""were i a bird i'd sing for thee 
 were i a bee i'd sting for thee 
 were i a peak i'd tower for thee 
 were i a tree i'd flower for thee 
 were i a flute--"" 
 the reading was interrupted as callum began to cough with alarming violence rabbie slapped him on the back with vigor 
 ""do i need to stop"" logan asked ""are you dying"" 
 callum shook his head 
 ""because i wouldna mind it if you were dying"" 
 ""no no"" at length callum looked up with a reddened face and choked out ""dinna mind me do go on"" 
 ""were i a flute i'd play for thee 
 were i a steed i'd neigh for thee"" 
 and against her will maddie finds himself falling for the man behind that steely exterior 
 and now despite all her best attempts to avoid it here it came 
 her heart started telling her a dangerous dangerous tale the story of a decent loyal man who'd treasured her letters dreamed of her nightly survived battles and marched across continents to come home--not to a castle or a glen but to her and even now when he held her in his arms he lacked the words to explain all the emotion in his heart 
 it was nothing but a silly fiction 
 it had to be 
 and like a gentleman logan doesn't immediately attempt to consummate his marriage he waits and waits and waits he waits so long that he has to endure the teasing of his men---who see fit to give him some advice about seducing his wife 
 rabbie hunched over to whisper ""she's got to see him with his kit off shirt plaid all of it"" 
 a coarse whoop rose up from the men 
 ""no i mean it"" rabbie said standing up ""here's how it goes you rise early one morning captain choose a misty one when the gloom's settled like a blanket over the valley"" 
 he waved his flattened hand before them like an artist painting a landscape ""you strip down to your skin and then you have a dip in the loch wait until she comes looking for you because she will they always do but pretend not to notice when she does and then--just when she's close enough to see and she's been watching for a while you rise up out of the water like a dolphin or a mermaid shooting up through the mist and pushing your hair back with both hands""--rabbie thrust both hands through his hair to demonstrate--""with all the little beads of water trickling down over the ridges of your shoulders and chest"" he danced his fingers down his belly ""like so"" 
 i can't tell you how many times this book made me laugh it was so sweet i've sang the praises of this series since the first book and with good reason everyone even a hardened crude soul like me needs a little cuteness and och man this was feckin' adorable it's not easy to write a review for a book when said book is tightly held against your chest 
 my lady jane is wonderful and so so magical i want to keep it close to me for an indefinite amount of time 
 you might wonder: three authors three different point of views three stories intertwined how will that play out 
 comically apparently 
 this key to having a great time with this beautiful piece of fiction is to not take it too seriously 
 sometimes absurd sometimes silly but always charming my lady jane will not let you fall into boredom 
 the chapters are brimming with humour romance adventure and absolutely delightful characters 
 it's said to be an alternative fantasy story of lady jane grey and while i am not a fan of historical fiction i adored this one to bits 
 as i said earlier it's not meant to be taken seriously really it's all for your entertainment and the many changes that were made to lady jane grey's real story are so interesting because they're original and unexpected and definitely diverting 
 for a book that was written by three different authors they certainly nailed the point of views the writing flowed there is no abrupt change in the writing style; everything is smoothly done 
 it works everything does: the not-so-proper-to-the-century writing style (--the word ''vampire'' clearly didn't exist during that era) the light atmosphere the shape-shifting element the many dangers and adventures and awkward yet fun situations the characters are put in 
 i never read the princess bride before (though i am not unfamiliar with the movie adaptation) but knowing they have much in common automatically places it to the top of my tbr pile 
 one last thought: it's very rare for me to read five hundred pages this fast but it's hard not to breeze through my lady jane even putting it down for a second will not be an easy thing to do 
 blog | youtube | twitter | instagram | google+ | bloglovin' i liked this book more than amy poehler's or issa rae's or ellen degeneres' or sloane crosley's or laurie notaro's i liked it less than mindy kaling's or caitlin moran's or lindy west's or roxane gay's or jessi klein's or melissa broder's or tina fey's but more than anything else i am grateful that there are so many interesting troubled funny wise extraordinary female voices that i can read and relate to and be horrified and inspired by this series changed my life i cannot even begin to go into the details of how much i fell in love with the main characters: claire beauchamp and jamie fraser the love story between these two beautifully written characters actually transcends time and logic their devotion respect and soul-reaching love was one of beauty and even awe inspiring theirs is a long and beautiful historic journey together reaching limits and boundaries of both heartwarming depth and gut-wrenching tragedy not to be cryptic it's just that this indescribable story is meant to be told through the words of the brilliant author diana gabaldon 
 fyithis is an incredibly long series with 7 books published (most average 1000 pages) with an 8th book due in 2014 it's a commitment to say the least but very worth the absolute loveliness that is gabaldon's brilliant and stunning love story my words will never do this series justice this book was so beautiful and haunting i fell in love with so many of the characters and loved how their lives were weaved together knowing the time period this was set in i knew the ending would hurt and it did though i didn't shed as many tears as i expected 
 the writing was incredible the descriptions so vivid it did a superb job of showing the reader how the characters felt through their actions rather than telling whilst the short chapters (on average 15 pages) helped to make this read a little quicker it was still quite a slow book i really enjoyed being able to savour it and get to know the characters however there were some points where it felt a little too dense and slow there are many reasons why i wouldn't like this book: 
 1 i hate feeling dumb 
 2 it's set in ancient israel 70 ce to be exact and the fact that i had to ask what ce meant --being a child of bc and ad --did not go over well (refer to #1) 
 3 it's set in ancient israel and i shamefully have absolutely no clue what happened back then i mean besides the last temptation of christ and bible stories that i kind of sort of remember (#1) 
 4 the author also wrote practical magic which i have not read but i have seen the movie and besides it being pretty damn awful i got a serious complex having to look at nicole kidman and sandra bullock slink around in little black dresses and she's also a favorite of oprah which causes controversy on its own level that i don't care to go into but still am squeamish about 
 5 hype wasn't it one of the books nominated for a gr book of the year 
 6 it's a book that one of my co-workers would look at and say 'oh i've read that' (a definite sign to stay away) 
 7it's set in masada and i don't know about you but i had no idea what masada was maybe it's my titanic i don't know but going off of #1 i didn't like it when i mentioned this to a friend and he said 'oh when all the jews killed themselves and their families rather than be captured by the romans what a massacre and i was only about 200 pages into it and had already started to care for some of the characters and well hate it when surprises are ruined (run-on sentence whatever)and well (#1) 
 so yes there were many challenges to face reading this book i'm not even sure why it was on my to-read list it's not like any of you suggested it to me or i think i might have run across this ditty at some point because i had a deja vu type moment when i read it: 
 ""for those who say that the witch of moab never loved anyone that she was selfish concerned with her own fate alone i can only say that she was ruined by love and delivered by it and that she left something glorious to the word a child who loves to stand in the rain"" 
 okay yes you've written it off as a chick lit book i get it i would too based on that which is by the way on the last page of the novel and couldn't have ruined my opinion of the story no how 
 this book is elegant that's probably the highest praise that i can bestow right now i crave to be elegant i am clumsy and messy and blabber and start sentences with 'and' and disregard all my 7th grade english teacher mrs van houten taught me about punctuation 
 the story is based on actual events you can even see some of the items mentioned in it at museums and such but what hoffman has done has created characters around this story the lives of four dovekeepers and the people who surround them she presents them to you in such a way that you actually feel like you were handling doves (that is if you liked them and c'mon too many weddings show that the cliche is true) the women are capable and graceful and intelligent they have a quiet strength and live with many ghosts they have all come to masada for different reasons and fate leads them to one another and we hear each of their stories in their own voice the assassin's daughter the baker's wife the warrior's beloved the witch of moab 
 hoffman's writing style was simple short sentences statements rather but beautifully written so much so that i would find myself going back to the pages that i marked off to re-read passages so much said in so little fashion ""i took my hand from his he looked like ice but ice is known to burn"" or "" when the wind is so strong that we women know we will choke on the rising dust if we fail to tie our scarves across our faces boys will always ignore the elements and race through storm clouds dreaming of glory"" 
 the first page of the book before the map even has this written on it: 
 ""let my burden be your burden and yours be mine"" 
 much better than that crap people recite from that wedding song life is hard people die and people suffer and the most honorable thing you can do is help carry the weight good grief if i had even one textbook half this enthralling in high school who knows what kind of impassioned -ologist i would have grown up to be i hereby petition bryson to re-write all curriculum on behalf of the history of the world 
 i would run across things half-remembered from midterms and study guides and think ""you mean this is what they were talking about you have got to be kidding me"" it's never condescending always a joy 
 in fact what i loved most is the acute childlike sense of wonder seeping through the pages how fantastic little we know about the world in which we live all the great scientific leaps fallen through the cracks all the billions of leaps that will never be made every scientist who with an amiable grin shrugs to say ""i don't know we don't know who has any idea"" the world is a magically baffling enchanting place and after nearly everything there is infinitesimally more i had such high hopes for this book but it turns out that now i'll be writing one of my only truly negative reviews on goodreads 
 sophia amoruso has surely accomplished a lot with nasty gal and i respect her work ethic and ability to achieve success with rough beginnings and little formal education however i expected this book to relate more to those in her generation - instead she turns out to be yet another naysayer of the millennial generation writing them off as lazy and spoiled for someone in her early thirties with a lot of life left to live she often puts herself up on a pedestal and talks down to readers taking herself more seriously than necessary also she seems frustratingly lacking in self-awareness and empathy - she often writes as though everything she has earned is wholly ""deserved"" and that the universe provided what she was ""owed"" without honestly acknowledging that many out there who have likely worked harder and longer than her haven't gotten nearly as much success for example at one point she writes about how bringing children to a job interview is an immediate turn-off for her; does she not realize how many single parents in poverty cannot afford childcare how else are they supposed to make money to provide for their family this is only one instance out of many where she lacks the ability to relate to those less fortunate than herself in fact she spends a whole chapter refuting the idea of luck and claiming that her ""positive thinking"" brought opportunities to her nice thought but it comes across as entitled and naive 
 while there are moments of amusing anecdotes and inspiring stories in general it seems that amoruso has little more than tired old cliches to offer in terms of business advice the last ten years have mutated my views on religion i went from a vague agnostic live-and-let-live attitude to a full blown distrust and dislike of mass worshipping of mysterious deities when it wasn't being used as an excuse to murder people who believed different things then it was being used to deny basic scientific concepts or prevent consenting adults from marriage based on gender overall i'd become convinced that humanity was far too stupid to use religion as anything but yet another system to justify telling someone else how to live 
 so naturally one of my favorite novels of the last ten years is a funny and touching book about the life of jesus 
 yeah it was that kind of decade 
 the story is told by jesus's best friend biff actually biff quickly explains that jesus was known as josh back in the days when they were kids in nazareth biff knows there is something special about josh from the moment they meet and he adopts a life-long role of dealing with the practical matters that the naive josh tends to overlook when teen-aged josh decides to track down the wise men who attended his birth to see what they can teach him about how he should become the messiah biff knows he has to go along to protect josh from an evil world 
 together they travel across asia invent sarcasm learn alchemy discover coffee and become kung fu experts as josh prepares himself to one day return home and fulfill his ultimate destiny 
 it's no surprise that christopher moore could write a very funny book about the life of jesus what is surprising that he's able to make it so touching that even a cynical non-believer such as myself could be moved by it by focusing in on the basic love-thy-neighbor concepts that josh fiercely preaches moore wrote a warm reminder of what christianity is supposed to be about why do people rate books before reading them this skews the ratings and i wish people wouldn't do so 
 this was my most anticipated book of all time i couldn't wait to read and and naturally was a bit let down my least favorite of his three 
 i found the voice in some of the chapters a bit awkward 
 the characters were interesting and well developed for the most part i didn't like how the author chose to weave everything together 
 there were some very well done parts -some moments that were very beautiful i'm glad i read this but won't anticipate the next book nearly as much although i will definitely read the next one hoping to experience something powerful when i was 16 my great aunt pauline told me the saddest true story i asked her about her background she was of polish decent in a completely german town in washington state she told me that when her family came over from poland her mother had pink eye and was sent back to poland to try again she was pregnant and when she got back she had a child that was not listed on the papers she put the baby in a suitcase to keep the officials at ellis island from finding her and separating her again that baby was pauline they went out west and her mother died several years later in child birth pauline remembered being set out on the porch with her younger siblings the babies in a laundry basket and her father standing on the porch as people came by to pick out who they wanted she was older and chosen last and by a couple with a different language and moved to this area she ended up in she said ""they picked us out as if we were puppies in a basket i am not a puppy in a basket"" i am crying just remembering the pain in her voice when she told me this she told me she didn't see any of her siblings until she was an adult and that the couple trained her in how to be a good worker what a childhood for one of the sweetest women i ever knew i wish i had recorded her story asked more questions there is never enough time this book told a similar tale and i could not put it down it rang so true read it fantastic amy poehler is so funny and relatable and inspirational i especially loved learning about how she got into comedy and improv (as that's something i'm interested in myself) and just her general attitude and perspective is so refreshing and positive i actually listened to the audiobook for half of this and it was brilliant--amy's narration just makes this extra fun and hilarious overall this was an awesome memoir (and the parks and rec bit at the end just gave me so many feelings ugh it was painfully beautiful) mfysh fyd@

 mhmd l`rby this book was wonderful intense and quite frankly exhausting it truly was a ride i had some minor problems with this and i mean minor so i am giving it a 485 haha 
 those problems were pure maiden trope got slightly old and happiness was so closely related only to sex which got a little repetitive 
 i might/ probably will be doing a mini review on this 
 ~2017 update~ lowering the rating because the maiden trope mentioned earlier is more problematic than my naive self picked up on 3 years ago it's pretty dang creep sketch kept it at 2 stars because the russian war setting is still done well very candid account of growing up disadvantaged and white the parallels between his demographic and a historically systematically marginalized black america are evident both populations deserve understanding and empathy but i tend to think the author thinks his people are somehow more noble i would have like to seen an acknowledgment that the two groups should not be antagonistic but work together to achieve mutually beneficial economic goals i cannot write a review that can do this book justice this is what goes through my head: 
 * i am so happy i give few books five stars because then when i run into a book this good my five star rating means something 
 * you need a strong stomach for this book i have warned you 
 * once you start you will not be able to read or do anything else 
 * there is no humor in this book i always need humor except not here don't ask me why i just didn't need it i was riveted from start to finish i needed to understand the relationships that lie at the core of what happened i was so focused on understanding the why i didn't have any need for humor humor simply doesn't belong in this book this is nordic historical fiction of times long past - there is hunger and cold and darkness that is the way it was and people living in such difficult times did such twisted things 
 * the book is not spooky it is atmospheric 
 * the writing similes metaphors - they are all just perfect stunning writing 
 * you will be moved jeez at the end no not just at the end all the way through 
 * and this is very important do not read this book please if you possibly can listen to it the narration by morven christie is totally fantastic the icelandic is perfect the tempo is slow and it must be slow so you can think about what is being said so you feel the doom and darkness of the events this is an excellently written book and excellently narrated both 
 phew after this i don't want another nordic drama for a long time my emotions cannot take it i have been through a wringer with this one 
 i assume you have read the book description so you know that this story is based on true events there is a chapter at the end that explains all the research involved the author closely follows what is known there are different views of agnes' behavior but the author has totally convinced my of what her study of the facts have lead her to believe 
 this is one of the best books i have read/listened to this year 
 ************************************** 
 after half: 
 i have listened to half now i still absolutely love it it has love too one of the few authors that can feed me a love story and please me immensely i am convinced agnes did not kill the man she is accused of killing but history says she is beheaded for this reason remember this is nordic historical fiction now i will say no more i don't know what will happen in the rest of the book so i cannot possibly give a spoiler 
 you read this book for the marvelous atmosphere and the lines gorgeous lines a superb writer 
 ***************************** 
 after 6 chapters: 
 this book is beautifully written atmospheric nordic historical fiction at its best the narration by morven christie is wonderful too don't read it listen to it i have only listened to 6 chapters but there is no way this book can get anything but 5 stars 
 hannah kent is australian mentored by geraldine brooks this book is far better than any i have read by geraldine brooks and i am not disparaging brooks when i say that how to write a successful book:

 well if this is a book then the above is a review let's state it up front this is a great book not a pretty good book with some nice qualities but a powerful beautiful thoughtful and incredibly moving work of art that will be read for generations the orchardist is even more incredible for being a first novel the best first i have read since edgar sawtelle yes that good 
 talmadge had lived forty years in the orchard without any exceptional event happening to him barring inclement weather or some horticultural phenomenon nothing to speak of in the human realm really and then this happened 
 he had had a tough time of it after the mining death of his father in 1857 when he was nine years old his mother traveled with him and his sister elspeth north and west until they found a suitable piece of land in what is now washington state there they set up a farm three years later mom passes and talmadge and his one-year-younger sister are left on their own to run it oh and toss in a bout of smallpox that he manages to survive a few years later a year after that at the ripe old age of 17 his sister takes off some childhood when we meet talmadge he is well into middle age one day while at the market with his produce he spots two filthy teen-age girls stealing some of his apples and everything changes 
 talmadge is a man who has lived most of his life alone with the arrival of these girls he sees a chance to have what he always wanted a family but they are toting more than just hunger and the bulges in their young bellies the girls had had a particularly difficult youth orphaned very young ill used after and their fear makes it difficult for them to accept talmadge as someone they can trust they take up residence on his land he takes care of them as much as they will allow when the man from whom they are fleeing arrives events take a very dark turn 
 the core story of the novel is talmadge's struggle to save one of these runaways from the darkness both without and within what he gains loses experiences and learns you will love him he is a good good man trying his very best in extremely trying circumstances he will spend the rest of his life trying to do right by the young lives that have been placed into his hands despite their resistance maybe in doing this talmadge is doing what he hoped someone would have done for his long-vanished sister one of his charges travels a similar path searching always for that connection to her lost one 
 he has two amazing friends clee is a mute nez perce who talmadge has known since arriving and caroline middey is a local healer a sort of big sister for him the depiction of talmadge's friendships with clee and caroline is rich and incredibly moving coplin has made many of her subsidiary characters come alive 
 the text is sewn with descriptions of small pieces of this verdant and sometimes harsh world these passages glow capturing the vibrant beauty of the land the affection the residents have for it and the depth of their connection coplin has a gift for description you can feel the warm sun on your skin the breeze brushing past your cheek as it ripples fields of grass 
 he did not articulate it as such but he thought of the land as holding his sister--her living form or her remains he would keep it for her then untouched all that space would conjure her if not her physical form then an apparition: she might visit him in dreams and tell him what had gone wrong why she had left him where did she exist if not on earth--was there such a place--and did he want to know about it if it existed what was a place if not earthbound his mind balked he was giving her earth to feed her in that place that was without it an endless gift a gesture that seemed right: and it need never be reciprocated for it was a gift to himself as well to be surrounded by land by silence and always--but how could this be after so much time--by the hope that she might step out of the trees a woman now but strangely the same and reclaim her position in that place 
 the land itself is family there are other manifestations of this connection between people and nature the nez perce deal in horses and one of the girls becomes enamored of these animals the way talmadge is bound to his orchard seeing in the horses the same presence of a lost loved one that talmadge sees in his land 
 coplin whose parents owned orchards in the wenatchee county where her novel is set knows of what she describes 
 in my family which is somewhat nontraditional (some of us are related by blood some not) there is a history of domestic violence and sexual and substance abuse when i was growing up only some of this was known to me--i sensed it without understanding what it was--but what was immediately before me what was right in front of my face was the immense beauty of the landscape--orchards wheat fields forests--and people who did not hurt me but loved me very much and were affectionate and kind these elements--a child's half knowledge of a painful family past and sensitivity to the physical landscape--formed the book 
 there is such sadness here we feel with talmadge the loss of his sister and it is hard not to choke up even when recalling this long after having read the book there is also the fire of hope that talmadge guards nurtures that offers light by which to steer his course he travels a hard road to find what he wants needs to give what he can what he must you cannot read this book without coming to feel for this man and to admire the skill and clearly love with which he has been crafted 
 i thought of the old man and the sea except in this case the fish the old man is trying to bring home is a lost soul of a young woman who is in danger of being consumed before he can get her to port coplin though says that her models were faulkner and toni morrison i leave it to those better versed than i to go into detail on those comparisons 
 there is beautiful mirroring in use here talmadge is searching for some peace denied him as a child while the young woman he wants to help is searching for a peace of her own so long denied her by the guilt she feels for a decision taken when she was still young both talmadge and his charge keep their thoughts and feelings to themselves a scene in which horses are broken reminds a runaway of how people were broken in her earlier experience silences pervade in this remote place talmadge's mother had preferred quiet to almost anything and talmadge acquired the trait clee of course does not actually speak at all and we learn that elspeth had difficulty speaking as well the two runaways also speak little 
 there is an existential theme that permeates where does one's self leave off and everything else begin 
 there was no wilderness to lose oneself inside she touched her face in the dark: she had her self but then she thought her self was nothing she was nothing 
 later 
 a gentle wind a kind of sighing moved over the earth; and for a moment he felt as if his body had evaporated 
 and again 
 when she was alone when she was working it was as if she forgot about herself it seemed strange to state it this way but it was as if she had no outline no body even though the work was very physical where did her mind go her mind was steeped in the task at hand at such times she felt a depth of kinship with the earth 
 there are events that take place towards the back end of this tale that some readers might find a bit of a stretch would this person go that far to achieve the desired end maybe maybe not but it did not detract from the whole for me 
 the orchardist is not just a moving portrait of a remarkable man but a look at how people relate to place not so long ago i walked with my youngest through a particular stretch of greenwich village recalling events from a lifetime ago this happened here that happened there an event took place in that building on the corner that changed my life this is where i first set eyes on i did this and such there i told her that these streets and buildings held ghosts that called to me ""remember"" connections i cannot imagine abandoning for another locale i get this connection to land even if my orchard consists of wood and concrete structures and city streets rather than sylvan swaths and bears a spectral fruit that only i can consume i imagine most of us have similar experiences history and place entwined in memory sealed in and maybe emerging from a particular patch of earth talmadge's attachment is probably much more intense than many of ours but it will resonate i expect for most the orchardist tells a sometimes harsh and more times beautiful story you will care definitely have some tissues at the ready this is a great one and you will not want to miss it

 this was so fun and cute so much love $199 on kindle right now 6-26-17 as far as i know it's us pricing 
 re-read 2017 i had to read this book again for the new book next week i love it so freaking much this time i listened to it on audio from overdrive (it's now on my audible wishlist) the narrator fiona hardingham did a wonderful job 
 it was so nice to be back in lada's world she's just so tough but i did feel sorry for her with the love interest but it's extremely complicated she lets her guard down a little in that area but she's still a force heh that guy that tried to rape her that didn't go as planned i love it =] anyway you can see my old review for excerpts and fun stuff =] 
 ****older review**** 
 vlad dracul's heavy brow descended like a storm when the doctor informed him that his wife had given birth to a girl 
 oh little did he know that he would have one of the most brutal bad@ssed girl known to man 
 lada waved the knife at him in answer to the question she did not understand vlad raised an eyebrow he was wrapped in a fine cloak an elaborate hat on his head it had been nearly a year since lada had seen her father she did not recognize him 
 ""lada"" the nurse whispered ""come here at once"" 
 lada stood as tall as her short stocky legs allowed ""this is my home i am the order of the dragon i kill infidels"" 
 i am totally in love with the character of ladislav dragwlya (lada) she is beyond bad she just doesn't care and she will attack anyone she wants to be equal with men she doesn't care to be married off she doesn't care to do women stuff she trains to be a soldier a warrior woman she bad to the bone from the get go 
 radu had braced for another blow when aron's shout made him open his eyes aron was spinning in a circle trying desperately to dislodge lada she was not supposed to be here but somehow her presence was unsurprising she had jumped on the boy's back clasping her arms around him and pinning his arms to his sides radu could not see her face through her tangled drape of hair until aron twisted to the side revealing lada's teeth sunk into his shoulder 
 i wish i could have been like her with all of the bullies in school :-) 
 radu is lada's younger brother but she doesn't coddle him or give him comfort like a normal sister she will take up for him but she will smack him around as well although when they get a little older she's not as bad to him 
 i was thinking this was going to be a cool book about the awesome vlad and his kids but vlad is like a little sissy compared to his daughter lada they sort of switched places 
 this book took a lot of time building up to what i'm hoping is going to be an awesome saga with that ending i do believe so 
 vlad let halil pasha take lada and radu to the ottoman court he turned them over to an enemy although he wasn't bad to the kids he gave them schooling and decided to marry lada off when the time came oh and that decision went down well so she got sent off to another place with one of the sultan's sons to do more schooling with the son mehmed and her brother radu 
 lada spoke with a quiet clear voice and the room hushed in surprise no one expected the girl to speak she was probably not allowed to radu knew lada would not care either way ""on our wedding night"" she said ""i will cut out your tongue and swallow it then both tongues that spoke our marriage vows will belong to me and i will be wed only to myself you will most likely choke to death on your own blood which will be unfortunate but i will be both husband and wife and therefore not a widow to be pitied 
 there is no one like her to be that brutal and not take no sh*t in those times is just beyond coolness 
 lada eventually started training with the janissaries they are a form of soldiers that are paid a good wage she became friends with them when she didn't take crap from them either she eventually got her wish of becoming one of them but oh so much more 
 ""not very pretty for a whore"" the soldier behind her tugged on a strand of her hair she ducked under his arm grabbing his wrist and twisting it behind his back to pin him it was a trick she learned under the harsh tutelage of mircea and perfected by practicing on bogdan and radu the soldier shouted angrily and tried to pull away so she twisted harder pushing up against the joint he yelped in pain 
 ""you are prettier than i"" she put more pressure on his arm ""perhaps you could offer yourself as whore instead"" 
 she's amazing 
 lada mehmed and radu bond as much as lada allows herself to bond i really enjoyed all of that storyline there are some love interests in the book but they don't really go too far with that because it's more about kicking arse and getting the story set up 
 lada huffed exasperated ""very well what exactly does a friend do"" 
 ""i have never had one i was hoping you would know"" 
 ""then you are even stupider than you look radu is the one who makes friends i am the one who makes people want to whip me"" 
 ""good in the spirit of friendship i must tell you that i am bitterly jealous of the time you spend in the janisssaries' company i want you to stop training with them 
 ""and in the spirit of friendship i must tell you that i do not care in the slightest about your petty jealousies i am late for my training"" she hooked her foot behind mehmed's ankle then slammed her shoulder into his tripping him and throwing him to the ground 
 at some point mehmed becomes sultan when his father just decides to retire there is a whole other story line going on there too but i don't want to give out spoilers on certain things lada does end up saving a bunch of lives and there are more wars and what not 
 either way i loved this book i love lada and i look forward to the rest of the books please be good 
 ""not dragwlya"" she said ""lada dracul i am not longer the daughter of the dragon"" she lifted her chin sights set on the horizon ""i am the dragon""

 paul bryant had really only just started driving back home was still trying with his left hand to jam the seat belt buckle into its lock and - multitasking like mad - he was thinking about how to review life after life and probably getting too caught up in the various amusing ways it could be done so that he simply didn't notice the car poking far too far out of the side street when finally he did he had to swerve like crazy right into the oncoming traffic what with his seatbelt not being properly secured and the 30 ton lorry darkness fell rapidly

 paul bryant had really only just started driving back home was still trying with his left hand to jam the seat belt buckle into its lock and - multitasking like mad - he was thinking about how to review life after life but wasn't so caught up in the various amusing ways it could be done that he didn't notice the car poking far too far out of the side street stupid boy racer he thought as he made a violent emergency stop when he did finally get home he parked as usual round the corner got out of his car and was delighted to be confronted with one of the urban foxes which visited sherwood occasionally such elegant raffish creatures but there seemed to be something agitating this particular one it was moving side to side and then turning right round in some distress what was wrong with it suddenly it lunged towards him nipped him on the ankle and rushed away he thought about the disturbing incident later that evening as he sat at his computer and began his review but then he began to feel most peculiar he suddenly hated all the people who had written sniffy reviews of life after life comparing it to groundhog day (as if - that may be a totally great movie but bill murray is aware of reliving his endless day and ursula is not aware of reliving her life and it's her whole life - it's not even groundhog life please don't get me started); but also his mouth was dripping saliva he had a high temperature he was sweating like crazy and his hair was standing straight up urgggghhhe lapsed into a coma darkness fell - again

 paul saw the idiot boy racer trying to edge out of the side road and slowed down to let him out why not let him cause a fatal crash somewhere else when he got home as he opened the car door he was confronted with one of the urban foxes who visited sherwood occasionally but this one looked a little strange thinking it might possibly be rabid he gave it a blare on the car horn and it ran off later that evening sat at his computer he was trying to marshal his thoughts on kate atkinson's pitch-perfect contemplation of our little lives and their infinite forking paths (ursula's main problem was that she couldn't change the fact that she was born in 1910 - hitler was always waiting for her) and how this gimmicky pop-philosophical soft-science fiction not-quite-alt-hist novel morphs into a terrifying war story one of the best descriptions of life during the blitz ever - but his thoughts were interrupted by the roar of a police helicopter they fly around sherwood sometimes always en route to st ann's which is gangster territory this one seemed to be right above his house what a racket suddenly the noise stopped peace that was not such a good thing however as the helicopter's engine had cut out and the helicopter was descending rapidly through his roof darkness fell quite quickly

 paul - didn't crash - wasn't bit by rabid fox - didn't have police helicopter fall on his house - made it to his computer in one piece and thought for a moment yes the review how about this

 thomas cresswell 
 alright of course there will be more words i just needed to give you a proper motivation to grab this extraordinary book and an obnoxiously yet damnably brilliant british boy seemed like a good idea now that i have your attention let's move on shall we 
 ""one taste of warm blood is never enough miss wadsworth"" 
 jack the ripper 
 the whitechapel murderer leather apron whatever you call him he's still the same; a monster that lingered in the shadows bathed in blood and gore and terrorized london with his brutality and depravity there are numerous theories about his identity but none of them was confirmed and so kerri maniscalco crafted her own tale a tale of heroes and villains 
 ""there's nothing better than a little danger dashed with some romance"" 
 audrey rose wadsworth was not a proper lady she chose science over blind faith and spent her afternoons cutting up dead bodies rather than taking her tea with actual proper ladies discussing eligible bachelors and gowns her dark curiosity was never satisfied so she cut and stitched and cut and stitched until one day the mutilated body of a prostitute shook her to the core and it was not the last assisted by an insufferable mortuary student she made the solution of these horrible crimes her top priority while her family was falling apart and jack the ripper was always one step ahead solidifying his reign of terror but sometimes answers can do more damage than good 
 ""fear is a hungry beast the more you feed it the more it grows"" 
 stalking jack the ripper was macabre gruesome ghastly 
 morbidly fascinating 
 the descriptions could be so graphic that bile rised up my throat the ambience so eerie i couldn't suppress my shivers the mystery so tangible my heart bet frantically in my chest kerri maniscalco's palette contained gloomy colours grey for the mist that covered london black for the shadows that hid the ripper's work mixed with crimson red for all the blood that was spilled and in the middle of this canvas of death were two young forensic students a boy and a girl whose skills and wit would make sherlock holmes and watson proud 
 source 
 wadsworth a girl determined to be both pretty and fierce a girl that fought for what she wanted sick of the stereotypes against women and eager to prove them wrong and while i couldn't help but admire her for her spirit i did get angry at her a couple of times i should hate to be judgemental but why why why was she so reckless and impulsive when there is a serial killer on the loose who targets women and his savagery is unprecedented you don't leave your house late at night lurking near the sight of the murders based on the belief that he won't attack you 
 cresswell a rich young man cold and distant when it comes to murders and corpses but with a fire burning within him that awaits for the moment to be ignited his replies are always witty and sarcastic he is aware of his marvelous deduction skills and vast knowledge and this makes him arrogant but he is caring and loyal and i am so smitten it's ridiculous 
 ""without lifting his head from his own journal he said ""not having any luck figuring me out then don't worry you'll get better with practice and yes""--he grinned wickedly eyes fixed on his paper--""you'll still fancy me tomorrow no matter how much you wish otherwise i'm unpredictable and you adore it just as i cannot wrap my massive brain around the equation of you and yet adore it"" 
 get a spoon because i am a puddle of goo wadsworth and cresswell are always bickering driving each other crazy and the attraction between them turns slowly into something deeper that does funny things to your stomach (which is pleasant after all the ugly things the body parts and fluids have done to said delicate stomach) while the tension sets you on fire 
 ""i don't blame you i am rather attractive the tall dark hero of your dreams swooping in to save you with my vast intellect you should accept my hand at once"" 
 stalking jack the ripper is a superb debut and i am all too eager to read the next adventures of wadsworth and cresswell great job kerri maniscalco

 the brain is locked in total darkness of course children says the voice it floats in a clear liquid inside the skull never in the light and yet the world it constructs in the mind is full of light it brims with color and movement so how children does the brain which lives without a spark of light build for us a world full of light 
 marie laure leblanc is a teen who had gone blind at age 6 she and her father daniel fled paris ahead of the german invasion arriving in the ancient walled port city of saint malo in northwest france to stay with m-l's great uncle etienne his ptsd from ww i had kept him indoors for two decades they bring with them a large and infamous diamond to save it from the nazis daniel had made a scale model of their neighborhood in paris to help young marie laure learn her away around and repeats the project in saint malo which is eventually occupied by the german army 
 werner and jutta pfennig are raised in a german orphanage after their father is killed in the local mine werner has a gift for electronics and is sent to a special school where despite the many horrors of the experience his talent is nurtured he develops technology for locating radio sources and is rushed into the wehrmacht to apply his skill in the war his assignment brings him to saint malo where his path and marie laure's intersect 
 anthony doerr 
 there are three primary time streams here 1944 as the allies are assaulting the german-held town 1940-44 as we follow the progress of werner and marie laure to their intersection and the 1930s we see the boy and the girl as children and are presented with mirrored events in their young lives that will define in large measure the years to follow werner and jutta are mesmerized by a french radio broadcast a respite from the anti-semitic propaganda the government is broadcasting the professor in the french broadcast offers lectures on science and inspires werner to dream of a life beyond the orphanage 
 open your eyes concluded the man and see what you can with them before they close forever and then a piano comes on playing a lonely song that sounds to werner like a golden boat traveling a dark river a progression of harmonies that transfigures zollverein: the houses turned to mist the mines filled in the smokestacks fallen an ancient sea spilling through the streets and the air streaming with possibility 
 as her father is the head locksmith for the national museum of natural history in paris marie laure has the run of the place she spends a lot of time with a professor there learning everything she can about shells mollusks and snails 
 dr geffard teaches her the names of shells--lambis lambis cypraea moneta lophiotoma acuta--and lets her feel the spines and apertures and whorls of each in turn he explains the branches of marine evolution and the sequences of the geologic periods; on her best days she glimpses the limitless span of millennia behind her: millions of years tens of millions of years 
 both werner and marie laure are enriched by teachers and books as they grow no nuclear families here marie laure's mother died in childbirth the pfennig children lost their remaining parent when father was killed in the mine 
 the author in a video on his site talks about the three pieces of inspiration that provided the superstructure for the novel while 80 feet below ground in a nyc subway a fellow passenger was griping about the loss of cell service doerr appreciates the beautiful miracle that is modern communications at the start of the book i wanted to try to capture the magic of hearing the voice of a stranger in a little device in your home because for the history of humanity that was a strange thing i started with a boy trapped somewhere and a girl reading a story a year later he was on a book tour in france and saw saint malo for the first time walking around this beautiful seaside town a walled fortress the beautiful channel the green water of the channel breaking against the walls and i told my editor ""look how old this is this medieval town's so pretty"" he said ""actually this town was almost entirely destroyed in 1944 by your country by american bombs"" so i started researching a lot about the city of saint malo immediately and knew that was the setting that was where the boy would be trapped listening to the radio the third piece arrived when doerr learned that when the germans invaded the french hid not only their artistic treasures but their important natural history and gemological holdings as well 
 the story is told primarily in alternating marie laure's and werner's experiences but there is a third stream as well that of sgt major reinhold von rumpel a gem appraiser drafted by the reich to examine the jewels captured by the military and collect the best for a special collection he becomes obsessed with finding the sea of flames the near mythic diamond daniel leblanc had hidden away he is pretty much the prototypical evil nazi completely corrupt greedy cruel as close to a stick-figure characterization as there is in the book but his evil-doing provides the danger needed to move the story forward 
 there may not be words sufficient to exclaim just how magnificent an accomplishment this book is amazing spectacular incredible moving engaging emotional gripping celestial soulful and bloody fracking brilliant might give some indication there is so much going on here one can read it for the story alone and come away satisfied but there is such amazing craft on display that the book rewards a closer reading in addition to a deft application of mirroring in the experiences of werner and marie laure doerr brings a poet's sense of imagery and magic 
 marie-laure's sense of the world is filled with shell snail and mollusk experiences and references some are simple during a time of intense stress she must live like the snails moment to moment centimeter to centimeter in a moment of hopeful reflection these tiny wet beings straining calcium from the water and spinning it into polished dreams on their backs--it is enough more than enough you will find many more scattered about like you-know-what on a beach i knew early on that i wanted her to be interested in shells i'm standing here at the ocean right now i've always been so interested in both the visual beauty of mollusks and the tactile feel of them as a kid i collected them all the time that really imbued both ""the shell collector"" and marie with why does the natural world bother to be so beautiful for me that's really embodied in seashells i knew early on that i wanted her to find a path to pursue her interest in shells i think that fits -- i hope that fits -- with visual impairment using your fingers to identify them and admire them - from the powell's reviewwerner's snowy white hair alone might stand in for the entirety of the visible spectrum (although it is described as ""a color that is the absence of color"") the dreaded prospect of being forced to work in the mines in a literally coal-black environment the very antithesis of light offers motivation for werner to find another path and coal itself offers a balance for that other form of carbon that drives marie laure's father out of paris the one that embodies light while black and white are often used in describing werner's environment the broader spectrum figures large in his descriptions 
 werner liked to crouch in his dormer and imagine radio waves like mile-long harp strings bending and vibrating over zollverein flying through forests through cities through walls at midnight he and jutta prowl the ionosphere searching for that lavish penetrating voice when they find it werner feels as if he has been launched into a different existence a secret place where great discoveries are possible where an orphan from a coal town can solve some vital mystery hidden in the physical world 
 a nice additional touch is marie laure's reading of 20000 leagues under the sea it permeates the tale as her reading echoes events and tensions in the real world of the story 
 also avian imagery is a frequent soulful presence a particularly moving moment is when a damaged character is reminded of a long-lost friend (or maybe a long-remembered fear) by the presence of a particular bird associated with that friend and the time when they knew each other 
 there are substantive issues addressed in this national book award finalist moral choices must be made about how to respond when darkness seeks to extinguish the light there are powerful instances in which different characters withdraw into their shells in response to evil but others in which they rage against the night with their actions thoughtful characters question the morality of their actions as dark-siders plunge into the moral abyss sometimes the plunge is steep and immediate but for others it is made clear that innocence can be corrupted bit by bit the major characters and a few of the secondary ones are very well drawn you will most definitely care what happens to them 
 as for gripes few and far between there is a tendency at times to tell rather than show marie laure may be too good that's about it there are sure to be some who find this story too emotional i am not among them 
 just as werner perceives or imagines he perceives an invisible world of radiowaves all the light we cannot see enriches the reader with a spectrum of imagery of meaning of feeling you may need eyes to read the page ears to hear if listening to an audio version or sensitive educated fingers to read a braille volume (please tell me this book has been published in braille) but the waves with which doerr has constructed his masterwork will permeate your reading experience they may not be entirely apparent to your senses the first time you read this book they are there whether you see hear or touch them or miss them entirely they are there and they will fill you all the light we cannot see is a dazzling novel when you read it you will see

 definitely check out doerr's site and if you are wondering what he had in mind specifically with the title: it's a reference first and foremost to all the light we literally cannot see: that is the wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum that are beyond the ability of human eyes to detect (radio waves of course being the most relevant) it's also a metaphorical suggestion that there are countless invisible stories still buried within world war ii -- that stories of ordinary children for example are a kind of light we do not typically see ultimately the title is intended as a suggestion that we spend too much time focused on only a small slice of the spectrum of possibility - from doerr's siteinterview by jill owens for powell's

 i was split on erik larson's the devil in the white city because i found the half of the book about the 1893 chicago's world fair incredibly interesting but thought the other half about serial killer hh holmes to be just another true crime gore fest then in thunderstruck he again gave us some nice pop history with the story of marconi and the invention of the radio but then he stretched the inclusion of a crime story to a ridiculous exteme by trying to tie in a manhunt for a killer across the atlantic that used early wireless 
 i was hoping that in the garden of beasts would allow larson to play to his strengths with a story about nazis in the 1930s because i thought he could give a detailed look at life in berlin as hitler was consolidating his power and this time he'd actually have a legitimate horror story to tell without it feeling like something just tacked on to sell books instead i got a story about a couple of people who were surrounded by evil and didn't do a helluva lot about it 
 the story centers on william dodd and his daughter martha dodd was a history professor in chicago with minor political connections and a dream of obtaining a quiet government post somewhere so he could finish writing a history of the american civil war when president roosevelt couldn't get anyone else to take the job he asked dodd to be the ambassador to germany dodd accepted and took his wife and two grown children along with him like a lot of americans dodd was worried about some of the stories of nazi violence coming out at the time but thought that hitler might be nudged towards controlling the extreme factions since he'd just taken over as chancellor his interactions with the nazi power brokers and the rise of german nationalistic fervor eventually convinced dodd that hitler and his people were bad news for the entire world 
 here's where the book falls down for me larson got me interested in the chicago world's fair because i knew nothing about it and he made it come alive i already know about how the nazis came to power so the history piece of this is old news to me while there's some interesting slice of life details and larson does a nice job of giving you a sense of the weird combination of paranoia pride terror and zeal that pervaded germany in the 1930s it's really nothing i haven't heard before maybe i would have been more interested if i would have found dodd's story more intriguing but frankly the ambassador seemed about as interesting as a saltine cracker to me 
 dodd comes across as a decent enough guy for his time he did advocate policies of getting tougher with germany when most of america was in full isolationist mode but aside from irking the nazis with a couple of speeches and boycotting a couple of official functions he really didn't do anything (and as one of his critics of the time pointed out an ambassador who refuses to meet with the government of the country he's in really isn't accomplishing much) dodd irritated others in america's diplomatic service with his constant criticism of their spending and seemed more concerned with cutting costs at the embassy rather than dealing with the germans 
 the odd thing about this book is that larson all but ignores dodd's wife and son in favor of giving a detailed portrayal of his daughter martha martha came along with her father as her first marriage was ending and to put it mildly she got around i mean it's good that a woman in her time was sexually liberated enough to carry on with guys like the poet carl sandburg however once she dated the head of the gestapo and a top soviet spy as well as many many others i had the impression that martha was less than discriminating with her affections hell she even kinda went along with a half-assed scheme one of the nazis had to try and hook her up with hitler himself 
 so this becomes the story of a mild mannered diplomat dealing with the rise of some of the most evil fucks in history but he's pinching pennies at the embassy instead of giving visas to every jewish person he could find and his daughter is a sleeping her way through europe while at first extolling the virtues of the nazis then deciding that she's kind of a communist but in the end martha doesn't do much but put a smile on the face of any guy who gives her a wink and a smile 
 in this case i knew the history and only got a story about a couple of people who seem like they should have been maybe a chapter in larger history of the time and place dodd and martha just didn't impress or intrigue me enough to warrant reading a whole book about them it's disappointing that larson decided to make them the center of this i just started wolf hall and i find the relentless use of ""he"" to be extremely irritating in the first several chapters there are dozens of instances where it is not clear who is speaking every once in a while as if recognizing the problem she has created mantel uses the phrase ""he cromwell"" why not just say cromwell 
 unless there is some good reason which i can't imagine this sort of obfuscation is just lazy writing which disrespects the reader may i re-think that based on a comment by another reader it's not lazy writing it's very purposeful and very distracting 
  later  
 i just read some of the amazon reviews there are actually quite a few readers who found the ""he"" business as disconcerting as i did and who expressed their displeasure in rather strong terms along with many *-star ratings however many others really liked the book as do many goodreads readers so it must not bother them as it does me 
 another goodreads reader suggested that the use of ""he"" all the time created a closer intimacy with cromwell perhaps but i see it differently if you want to create intimacy use the first person then it is clear that everything is seen and felt by the single protagonist and the reader can share that character's viewpoint thoughts and feelings what mantel has done is not to bring us close to cromwell but to inject herself the author between the reader and the prime character she does this on practically every page and i find it jarring every time it happens 
 before my final negative notes let me say that mantel clearly has an exquisite command of the language even in the few chapters i read her elegant choice of words often made me reflect and smile she can paint a picture when describing a character or a setting that is truly wonderful and when she chooses to do so she writes a vivid scene that has power and emotion 
 such continuity of story however is the exception rather than the rule the constant switching of time and place often without the merest hint of transition made the reading much more difficult than it had to be just a word here or there would have made a huge difference 
 finally the breezy style in which much of the book is written is entertaining as many have noted and i agree but it had the effect of making me wonder if mantel was as true to the history as i think a historical fiction should be of course the dialogue and many of the personal incidents are made up but does the author when portraying actual events present them accurately i think such concern for the truth is an obligation of an author when writing about historical characters and events mantel left me unsure 
 i think i've had enough of wolf hall and perhaps other goodreads readers have had enough of my criticism of what is surely a popular book i don't usually write negative opinions but this book just seemed to drag them out of me i hope i have not offended anyone london late april 1812: a month that had seen violent civil unrest savage battles on the continent and the rumblings of aggression from the new american nation it was also the month in which queen charlotte--after a two-year hiatus--returned to the practice of holding drawing rooms for the presentation of young ladies into high society a battleground of a different kind 
 my goodness this book was delightful 
 it's got everything i like historical romance check magic check murder check that's not to say that something with all of these elements is bound to be good because clearly other books with fantastic elements have gone awfully terribly wrong but this book did it just right and boy was it fun to read 
 young lady helen is about to make her debut in society - presented to the queen no less when people start disappearing as a young noblewoman people expect her to say ""ain't nobody got time for that"" helen being the intelligent girl that she is decides to not leave it be and actually figure out wtf is going on otherwise we wouldn't have a book now would we 
 interspersed between the normal regency stuff like balls (almack's) and manners and possibilities of ruining one's prospects is the mystery of helen's parents and the strange things that are happening to her helen is a great character she behaves as befitting a young lady of her era and despite the book's blurb of will her intelligence and headstrong curiosity wind up leading them into a death trap i did not find her tstl in the least 
 the problem i have with most regency novels is that the main female character often mistakes bitchiness for independence no such problems with this book helen knows when to keep her head down to keep quiet when necessary but she is most definitely not without a sense of humor 
 ""but look at least twenty-five frogs on the bodice alone is it too much to ask for a dress that won't scare the horse"" 
 aunt leonore gave her loud cackle--the one that had earned her the title lady laugh amongst her friends and lady hee-haw amongst her enemies ""not this season my dear it is all military flimflam"" 
 ""bonaparte has a lot to answer for"" helen said ""first europe and now our fashion"" she flipped the magazine closed and rested it on her lap 
 ""you really do have your mother's grim sense of humor"" 
 there is a wonderful friendship between helen and her maid the actions between helen's secret investigation and her normal life as lady helen felt natural as are her natural doubts and fears between choosing between the life she was born to and the life she could choose and again contrary to what the book blurb says the romance is barely there 
 i have read alyson goodman's excellent eon series before and i'm so happy to say that she's done it again with this one 45/5 so sorry i am not worthy of the honor of reviewing this novel if however my lord insists it then i shall endeavor to offer up some humble thoughts regarding its mighty even epic narrative neh the scope is so vast the characters and settings are so many the head is liable to spin at times so sorry but the arc it follows is like a peregrine's path through the sky: long but fast and with vicious twists along what might otherwise have seemed a predictable path i'm sure my lord would agree that parts of the story can become quite tedious i am not speaking of the slow-to-develop romance between mariko and the anjin-san nor even of the dueling political machinations of toranaga and ishido no sire this humble vassal speaks more to the text and how japanese is interwoven with the barbarian words in so many places and then how barbarian words come even to replace japanese or barbarian words standing in for the words of other barbarian tongues if you'll excuse this vassal's petulant tongue sire it's enough to make one fart dust so sorry but these tedious affectations do blend in after a while neh and the narrative is quite the enjoyable one -- full of so much intrigue and humor a rousing and enjoyable tale of which i am not worthy to comment further please i cannot live with this shame please allow me to commit seppuku at once i did not hate this book (hate would be too strong a word and i can't hate it because i applaud the fact that ken follett attempted to write an epic novel) but i did not like it i didn't like it from the start; his writing style hit me like a brick but jim thoroughly enjoyed the book that i kept trying to convince myself that i ought to give it a chance hoping it would get better when i was about 500 pages in he saw how miserable i was and asked why i didn't just stop reading it but at that point i was invested in it; i had spent all that time getting that far that i needed to finish it and i couldn't wait to come to the end i kept counting down: ""only 450 pages left; only 300 to go; last 200 pagesyay i have 50 pages left"" those fifty pages were the toughest to get through by the time i was at the end i thought it was a wasted effort - both on his part and mine 
 it's so much easier to explicate on what i did not like because there were so many things: 
 - i loathed the writing style (he vacillated between pages and pages of highly complex architectural discourses to third-grade level simple sentences grouped into short paragraphs) sometimes it was bearable other times i wanted to pull my hair out there were times when i felt the only time he came alive as an author was when he was discussing architecture but these parts were so didactic in nature that it couldn't hold my interest for long periods of time 
 - i did not like the author's narrative style he had to tie everything together (causality was so prevalent throughout the text that i wondered how he didn't work in how the killing of a fly affected events 60 years later) every single storyline was wrapped up - too neatly for my liking in some cases everyone was tied to someone else (it was like playing six degrees); every single character had to have a denouement; every little plot twist had to be explained; closure had to be achieved no matter how preposterous the circumstances over time and space 
 - the characterization was poor in fact it was appalling how two-dimensional these characters were good people were good bad people were loathsome as time went on the good were always suffering one thing or another; they were put upon; they were harrassed; they were constantly challenged and put to the test like job (something follett actually used as a sermon) the badfolk became more oppressive over time; they were not only detestable but they had absolutely no redeeming qualities and to go with a typical medieval stereotype the good were always excessively beautiful honorable intelligent (geniuses or savants even) - and if they weren't rich they would be at the end (i half expected havelok the dane and his refrigerator mouth to pop up somewhere proving once and for all that in the medieval period to be good was to have the purest light shining out of your mouth each time you opened it) nevertheless the bad became uglier became more despotic scheming throughout life to get the better of their enemies (the goodfolk) but in the end good always triumphed over evil; those who could repented and were forgiven those who couldn't were killed off somehow because apparently death is the only way an evil person gets his (or her) dues and then everyone had a happy ending i hate happy endings when they're so obviously contrived and this work was so elaborately exhaustively thoroughly contrived (maybe it's not too late for me to change my mind and say i hated it *grin*) 
 - historically speaking there was so much left to be desired granted this novel was written two decades ago and there have been new discoveries about the medieval period since follett started his research but he got it all wrong anyhow his idea of medieval life was sooff that it hurt my head to continue reading sometimes i had to pause periodically and rant to jim about what i currently found off-putting (for example there weren't many literate people at the time; at the time this novel was set there was still a distinct divide between england and wales; reading and writing were two separate skill sets and people who knew how to read did not necessarily know how to write and vice versa; orality was a prevalent part of storytelling back then and books not so much and yet somehow he conflated much of both; manuscript writing was either orally dictated or copied tediously by the monks - his concept of a scriptorium was incomplete defective - and there has been so much written about this that it saddened me; he used modern translations of medieval poetical/verse works and couldn't explain even alliterative verse form effectively - i even wonder if he knew what it was; his understanding of the languages of the period - old english middle english latin norman french old french middle french etc - and what was spoken by the aristocrats vs the peasants vs the growing middle classes disgusts me; he showed a lack of understanding of medieval law medieval rights the social classes gender roles even the tales and legends of the period in both england and france; priests were quite low on the totem pole in terms of the religious hierarchy and were quite disparaged yet somehow that didn't quite come across in this noveli could go on and on but i won't) 
 and the historical part of the novel i just found lacking there are enough histories and chronicles contemporaneously written of the time that he did not have to deviate much from history there is so much written about the period between the death of henry i through the civil wars between the empress matilda and king stephen to the time that henry ii ascended the throne (including the martyrdom of thomas a beckett) that i don't quite understand how he couldn't have mined the chronicles for better material i understand that this is why it's called historical fiction and that there will always be some element of fiction interspersed with historical fact but the fictional aspects usually have to do with surrounding characters and situations that bolster the history the fiction is not necessarily to the history itself many times when writing historical fiction the author has to beware the pitfalls of creating a revisionist retelling interspersing his or her own ideals or beliefs of what should have been to what was if this novel had been marketed as a revisionary narrative it would have been okay but it wasn't i'm just glad that the historical aspect of the novel just served as the background and not the real story because then i probably would've stopped reading 
 the premise was a good one and held a lot of promise it could've been a great historical epic had it been handled by a more assured writer by someone who was more of a visionary someone who had the patience to do exhaustive research or who knew how to craft richly developed characters it needed an author who understood the epic genre who knew how to mold the epic who knew how to keep the narrative going seemlessly binding time with narration and the human condition without resorting to stereotypes and grating drama and most importantly it needed someone who understood when the story had been told; that while there will always be other stories to tell that each book has its own natural end and that these stories may not belong in this book 
 ken follett may be a bestselling author of suspense novels (and even historical fiction such as pillars of the earth and world without end) but he is no writer of epics compared to writers of historical fiction such as edward rutherford james michener bernard cornwell or margaret george ken follett has a long way to go outlander is not a book for everyone i'll put that right out there if you think you can stomach extreme sexual violence as well as themes of sadism then go ahead if you can understand good characters doing things in their historical context that would be seen as abuse now then give it a try 
 you won't be disappointed 
 gabaldon has finely crafted a novel that is radically different to the stereotype this is no average love story her research is extensive and flawless; bringing to life a world that is rich and dynamic in detail and character 
 her prose a beautiful and well constructed and the characters where do i even start with the characters they have depth they're lovable they're real 
 the problem with this book lies in two aspects: 
 it's pacing it's fantastic non-stop drama and action right up to the last 200 pages or so where it trickles down to a grinding halt the other problem with it is that many people are going to be uncomfortable with some of the things that happen in the book remembering the time difference and the culture that the male protagonist comes from is often hard when we judge his actions by today's standards 
 but to readers who can over look these things i highly recommend it as a book that is both incredibly well written enjoyable and addictive beautiful book we've all been wrong on this whole rainforest issue we don't need to save the rainforest we need to destroy the rainforest immediately 
 i knew that the amazon was a hostile environment but i was really shocked at the variety of horrific ways that the jungle will kill a person you've got your standard malaria and yellow fever then there's the piranha the electric eels the anacondas the coral snakes or the poisonous toads that are so toxic that one of them could kill a hundred people still not convinced how about the tiny fish that will swim into any orifice and proceed to do things so terrible that sometimes men had to be castrated to survive 
 that's not even talking about the bugs sure the mosquitoes spread disease but there's also a variety of maggot that will infect living tissue ants that can eat your clothes in a single night chiggers that eat human tissue cyanide squirting millipedes parasitic worms that cause blindness bugs that plant larvae under the skin where it will hatch later 'kissing bugs' that bite the lips but the victim doesn't die until 20 years later when their brain or heart swells 
 even if that doesn't kill you you'd probably starve to death in what is described as a counterfeit paradise because even though there's all kinds of plants and animals good luck finding anything edible avoid the animals the disease the bugs injury and starving to death and you're still screwed when hostile natives catch you eat you and use your skull as their favorite coffee mug 
 to hell with the amazon burn or bulldoze all of it and sow the earth with salt that treacherous hellhole has to be obliterated before it can spread and i don't want to hear about global warming or any nonsense about generating most of the world's oxygen we can breathe shallow people 
 old percy fawcett was a veteran explorer who mounted several expeditions into the amazon and somehow managed to escape with his life but he got obsessed with finding the mythical ruins of an el dorado-type city and led his son and another poor bastard to some kind of gruesome deaths the mystery of what happened to him led to countless deaths from other dumb asses trekking into the jungle to look for them 
 the guy who wrote the book knew all this and he was still stupid enough to go in there he somehow lived through it but i think the message is clear stay out first i should mention that i listened to this one on audiobook didn't read the text version 
 second the audio version is read by the author i think jenny did a nice job with it too if you're used to nothing but professional audiobook narrators there might be a few verbal ticks in here that might bug you but me for an autobiographical work like this i'd much rather hear it in the author's own voice 
 third she got some actual laughs out of me not just amusement or smiles not just chuckles real laughs i was driving around in my car alone laughing like a madman 
 fourth several times i sat in the car after i'd finished whatever trip i was taking just to continue listening to the audiobook 
 fifth driving around listening to this audiobook i missed the proper turnoff several times i didn't mind much because turning around and driving back the right way gave me more time to listen to the book 
 sixth she made me cry reading this three times now admittedly i seem to be rather soppy lately but even given my recent emotional fragility that's a mark of good writing some good writing 
 seventh the stories jenny lawson tells are in turns: crushingly honest funny witty sweet heartbreaking and delightfully bizarre 
 lastly i'd like to say that while i've read some of jenny's blog and i know of her considerably fame as the bloggess i didn't pick this book up because i was a fan i bought this audiobook audio because i like her and i've heard people say good things about it 
 after listening to it yeah now i'm a fan the short 
 actual rating: 45* 
 perfect for fans of: the diviners by libba bray a study in charlotte by brittany cavallaro long may she reign by rhiannon thomas daughter of the burning city by amanda foody (or if you've already read this and enjoyed it you might like these) 
 writing: 45 stars 
 characters: 45 stars 
 plot: 4 stars 
 originality: 5 stars 
 (all out of 5 stars) 
 the long 
 this was sooo good i had heard such great things about this book but knowing how mysteries are hit or miss with me i was extremely skeptical 
 what i expected: 
 a romance heavy mystery where i would be able to tell who was the culprit after one chapter (at most) 
 what i got: 
 a scientific approach to the infamous whodunnit' story of jack the ripper featuring a strong heroine with a deep dedication to her forensic studies constantly challenging what society deems is proper (with just the right amount of romance of course) 
 i listened to the audiobook which was awesome (i've already started the 2nd one) despite the fact that i went the audiobook route i still looked at the photos scattered throughout the story they really enhanced the reading experience making it feel like i was gathering bits of evidence alongside audrey rose as the story goes on 
 the forensics that went into this story are where i believe it really stands out as previously mentioned i'm not a huge mystery fan so i don't have much authority on the matter but this was one of the most unique ya mysteries i've ever read you can tell the author took care not only to research her subject jack the ripper but also the nature of forensics as a whole the anatomical descriptions painted grotesque pictures in my mind bringing the victims mutilated state to life (please forgive the terrible pun but i am weak willed in the face of bad jokes) 
 audrey rose's position as a young woman in the victorian era was an important aspect of the story as well as a proper high society female she is constantly underestimated and disrespected but she does not let circumstances limit her she constantly questions why she as a female isn't thought to be as capable as her male counterparts and as such always strives to prove said counterparts wrong this isn't necessarily uncommon in ya but this case was unique because it was a situation of the female outwitting her opponents not in a battle or political sense but rather in terms of her intelligence scientifically her fight to be able to be educated in her uncle's classroom shows how important knowledge is to her and she proves time and time again that it is her most lethal weapon 
 the murder mystery kept me guessing the whole time i'm not terribly good at figuring out whodunnit' mysteries so keep that in mind but i felt like the twists and turns this story took were not easily anticipated if i have one complaint it's that it dragged a tiny bit at points but it wasn't unbearably so this kept me on the edge of my seat and made for a perfectly spooky halloween read if you're looking for a good book to pick up this october give this one a chance i think it will surprise you yes really i almost gave this two stars except it includes george clooney and that would be a crime 
 this book is fine it didn't charm me it actually took me about three or four days to read 288 pages which is funny because a lot of those pages don't include any actual words (she's got a ton of photocopies and inspirational signs intermixed with the text) it just wasn't as fun to read as i anticipated 
 the problem is that she spends most of the book talking about how hard it is to write a book or how she struggles with her self perception or how she doesn't like people knowing her business (incidentally i think self-perception is an extremely valuable topic for women and teenagers but perhaps not what i was interested in reading when i picked this up) sometimes she's able to turn the ""i don't actually want to tell you anything about myself"" into a pretty funny chapter like when she writes out the descriptions of divorce self-help books she'd like to write (spoiler alert: she doesn't want to talk about her relationship with will arnett at all which is certainly her right) 
 but this means that she skips over many of the periods of her life that i was most interested in like the founding of ucb and her subsequent success she goes through a lot of ""then we got a bigger theater and then a bigger one and then i was hired at snl"" for most of the book i felt like she was skipping over the truly interesting side stories there are some anecdotes from snl and parks and rec but there are surprisingly few given how much time she's spent on both shows 
 then again back to george clooney: 
 on the day of the awards i simply asked george clooney's people to check and make sure george was okay with my sitting next to him at some point during the broadcast ""of course"" said george's people after not asking him i knew enough not to ask them to check with george and see if it was okay to sit on his lap this was a request better saved for the last minute and in person or better yet when the time came i would just sit on his lap without even asking as the old saying goes ""don't ask for permission to sit on george clooney's lap beg for forgiveness once you do"" 
 so i sat on george's lap and ever the pro george asked me what kind of bit i was cooking up i told him when they cut to me in the audience after announcing my nomination for best comedy actress i was going to act totally engrossed in talking to him i told him i thought it would be funny if we were just flirting and laughing he understood immediately and handed me a glass of champagne i told him if i won there was a very good chance i would kiss him hard on the mouth he responded ""that's not a bad sunday"" as the camera cut to me he whispered in my ear ""the thing about making movies is "" 
 perhaps if i'd listened to this as an audiobook i might have enjoyed it more when i went back to read some sentences over and consciously tried to hear her voice i definitely thought some of it was funnier but overall i vacillated between two and three stars and landed on three only because this is amy poehler's book yes really i'll be honest here it's really rare that i get through a book over 500 pages let alone 700 (nook pages) it's also true that i have never read a single thing from mr king until now why i'm not sure maybe his books intimidated me because when i was younger everyone was always talking to me about how his books were so long and blah blah anyway i am proud to say that 11/22/63 was my first book read by stephen king i hear it's so much different than his other work but i also haven't met a single person that didn't love it i read this book because everybody and their brother was recommending it to me as a ""must read"" i'm also not a big historical fiction fan and didn't know how much i would enjoy reading about 20 years before my birth i had nothing to worry about 
 here is a book that you never want to end yet you do want it to end because you need to know what is going to happen king introduces us to a man named jake who insists that he is not emotionless despite the fact that he doesn't cry often i can relate to him right off the bat not a big crier but i definitely feel emotions on a huge level jake is sent back to 1963 with a plan made up by a guy named al who owns a local diner and has the ""rabbit hole"" which is how they travel back in time at first his mission is just to stop lee harvey oswald from assassinating jfk but then little things pop up here and there making him consider a few new things that need to be changed i'm not going into any more detail than that because i don't want to give away one single thing in this brilliant novel fans of his story ""it"" may be excited to know he revisits the town of derry maine where ""it"" was located 
 the excitement and suspense in this book were astonishing i held my breath in anticipation of certain things jake had to do and then some twist would come out of left field and i would continue reading in awe there were also several sighs of relief and a couple of cute moments involving jake's romance that just made me say ""aww"" 
 i do feel like there were a rough 100ish pages that dragged on somewhere in the middle and the book may have benefited by taking out a few things but obviously i'm no expert that's just my opinion again this may have also been just something i was feeling because i was very impatient and really wanting to know how this book would end some people didn't like the ending but i loved it 
 in the afterword king discusses his research a bit you can most definitely tell that a lot of research and thought went into this novel the descriptions are vivid and when i say you are really transported back to the 60's i mean it you will feel it 
 11/22/63 is a truly memorable wonderfully written book that i have already recommended to several family members and friends and i will continue to recommend for years to come this is another of king's books that i could see as a film too if you are wanting to try a stephen king book but don't know if you will like all the horror read this it is not like that at all gosh this book made me feel a lot of feels that were both sad happy mournful exhilarating & thoughtful it was both captivating and empowering to read this novel although it was slow in the middle during the last 50 pages i didn't want it to end i would love to see a novella about daniel & gretchen 20 years in the future since there are some loose ends (like their families and friends lives) i want clarified since i'm really curious 425/5 stars loved this book just like i did the first"
4,poetry," 2/7/2017 
 i get likes on this review daily and for a long time i've felt like a 3-star review was too generous so i lowered it to 2 today, which is more accurate in hindsight. 
 7/11/2016 
 if i could sum up my thoughts about this book, it would just be, ""oh."" 
 honestly, very underwhelming. i'm not sure why people go crazy about this book and say it's gorgeous and it's their favorite book, because honestly, it's very plain. some poems are just basic sentences with random skips that have no real point, they aren't too lyrical, and it's literally just like reading a normal sentence. i expected i would love every page of this, but i only marked 4 poems. this just was nothing new. the concepts in this poem, especially when it rolled around to the feminism aspects, just didn't wow me. an entire poem just about ""you don't need a man you want a man"" was just a repeat of things i've been hearing for years. it wasn't interesting, and a lot of the poems just sounded so pretentious because it was just plain text with no punctuation and random skips in the lines being fed to the reader as art. someone mentioned this was a little too ""tumblr,"" and i agree. it was a quick read, but just a little bit frustrating because it was too simple, too familiar. the art was nice and a few of the poems were well-written, but for the most part, it seems like very little effort was put into this, which makes me sad because that's such a mean criticism for an artist who puts so much emotion into her work. okay, i have finally reviewed this. it has been sitting in my windowsill-stack of ""books i gotta review"" long enough, and i just can't look at it anymore. as little as i wanted to revisit it, i feel anxious when i have placeholders or blank spaces in the review field, so here goes nothing. 
 i give every author three chances to impress me. you know the old saying: fool me once - shame on you. fool me twice, shame on me. fool me three times - it's back on you. 
 and sometimes it pans out - hermann hesse had a great last-minute save with demian after failing to wow me with either siddhartha or narcissus and goldmund. jane austen, i am sorry to say, got her three shots and none of them made me see what all the fuss was about. 
 this one... well, this one's on me. 
 that is a picture of the folded-over pages in my copy of this book, each one representing a poem in this collection that i found problematic in some way: sloppy rhyme/meter/rhythm, misused words, superficial abstractions, vague intention masked by ""pretty"" conceits, and just general ""offness."" no one has the time or inclination to go through the whole book with a red pen, but i'll refer to some specific examples in this review, lest anyone think my negativity is some knee-jerk bitterness over the nonsense that happened on my thread for love and misadventure and then continued to escalate outside of goodreads in situations that were very character-revealing. 
 remember, hikers, sometimes nature will put its poison in a pretty, pretty flower. 
 when you write a book and it becomes popular, you have two choices as a writer: you can either stick with what has already proven successful and continue in the same vein, or you can take a risk; evolve as a writer, and deliver something that shows you have range beyond your first time out. there are risks and rewards no matter which way you choose: taking risks can sometimes end in failure, losing the fans who liked your early stuff, but maybe gaining the respect of discriminating readers who appreciate risk. staying the same might satisfy your already established fans, but people who didn't like the first book aren't going to like the second book. 
 this book is not taking any risks, and is exactly the same kind of singsongy pap as the first book, and there are even six poems from love & misadventure reprinted at the end. in case you wanted to revisit them. 
 it's another collection about love and obsession and regret and breakup woe and the joy of defining yourself in terms of another person's feelings for you. there's no growth in the writing; both the subject matter and the way it is expressed are extremely infantile. 
 although this time, she's all growed up and gettin' racy and in one of her prose pieces, after some pillow-talk lover's fantasy about stealing a book from a bookstore, which is already douchey enough, the piece ends like so: 
 then do you know what i'd do? 
 what - would - you -do? she says between peals of laughter. 
 i'd take you out, fuck you up against the car. 
 stay classy, lang leav! 
 it's revealing to me that most of the glowing reviews of lang leav's books on here have expressed some variation of ""this is my first poetry book"" or ""i never liked poetry before this."" and that's great - it's always encouraging to see people enthusiastic about books, regardless of what the book actually is - every reader their book and yadda. and i understand that language is a constantly evolving creature - the word ""tragedy"" has become less-specific than its original meaning in colloquial usage, while ""decimate"" has broadened in scope and words like ""literally"" and ""epic"" have had their meanings obliterated completely and semantic bleaching morphs words all the time. but ""poetry,"" too?? has poetry become ""anything written in choppy little line breaks?"" i'm not even a huge fan of poetry, but i know that it's more than just words scattered on a page. and don't give me that ""free verse"" nonsense. because even free verse has rules. and here are some of them: 
 free verse is poetry that is based on the irregular rhythmic cadence recurring, with variations of phrases, images, and syntactical patterns rather than the conventional use of meter. in other words, free verse has no rhythm scheme or pattern. however, much poetic language and devices are found in free verse. 
 rhyme may or may not be used in free verse, but, when rhyme is used, it is used with great freedom. in other words, free verse has no rhyme scheme or pattern. 
 free verse does not mean rhyme cannot be used, only that it must be used without any pattern. 
 so, for example, a poem like this: 
 cannot be deemed ""free verse"" because there is an attempt at patterned rhyme, it's just poorly done. if you're going to make the effort to rhyme, follow through and be consistent. otherwise, the reader will find the hiccup grating and it just ruins any emotional connection you may have had to the poem because you are taken out of the moment and you have to start over and see what the hell happened. if you're going to choose to be rhyme-y - be rhyme-y - you can't go rogue in the middle or the end of a poem. find a way to make it work or abandon the idea of rhyme scheme altogether if it's clipping your wings, because honestly - greeting card rhyme patterns do not a sophisticated poem make, and i don't understand her commitment to this style when she can't even seem to do it correctly half of the time. 
 this one, okay, this one is free verse - hooray. 
 but here, leaving aside the jejeune sentiment and the tra la la of it, which may be appealing to some readers, there's a structural problem here in the scansion; the way the reader is led along by the nose in a consistent cadence and meter until that off-putting stumble over the finish line. it's terrible execution and shows complete disregard for the reader. 
 and this is something that occurs frequently throughout this collection - one lazy rhyme in the middle of a poem that otherwise has a very rigid rhyme scheme which throws the whole thing off. or one dissonant rhythm break that makes you wince. 
 it's not just the rhyme scheme and scansion - there's also just plain lousy editing. 
 this is the second poem in the book. ""i would not nearly had so much"" is not the way you want to introduce a collection. 
 but wait, there's more! 
 this book also contains a number of prose pieces, many of which are trying so hard to be clever and conceptual through the conceit of personifying abstractions (patience and love agreed to meet at a set time and place; beneath the twenty-third tree in the olive orchard), but they're so forced and artless. capitalizing a word does not automatically make it meaningful. you gotta supply the meaning with the other words. 
 there was a girl named despondency, who loved a boy named altruistic, and he loved her in return. 
 for grammatical/semantic balance, shouldn't that be ""altruism""? or ""despondent?"" noun/noun or adjective/adjective? this is what is so frustrating - it's all surface-pretty, but utterly thoughtless. you can be as surprising or poetic as you like, but there should also be lyrical elegance. there's no sense that any effort went into the writing of these, no going back and rereading to make sure these words work together. it's all churn with no meaning. 
 and jesus, this: 
 that is the complete poem. and it's a mess. analogies are meant to be gracefully balanced comparisons of the relationships between disparate things. (hot is to cold as fire is to ice) but this one is ass-backwards, as anyone studying for the sats could tell you. i assume she's riffing off the adage that ""time heals all wounds."" and she's aware that a suture is used to close a wound, which is a literal comparison to the metaphorical healing that time performs. but in the syntax she's using here, she's basically saying that ""wounds heal all sutures."" which is incorrect. and i'm sure she thought it sounded pretty and was so darn proud of her rhyme she thought no one would notice how sloppy and illogical it was. but i certainly did. 
 these instances of ""i am making pretty words say things that sound kinda smart and poetical"" but make no sense occur frequently, like sometimes when i read a book, parts will lift from the pages in an anagram of your name. like a code to remind me it's not over. like dyslexia in reverse, which makes my head hurt too much to even begin to parse. 
 and it goes on and on - incomplete thoughts, missing words, elisions: 
 how they easily what? 
 what is the ""it"" here; the reason for their being? does this refer to ""time is told by seeing?"" so - ""time is told by seeing"" is the reason for the existence of clocks? what the shit does that mean and why did this insight necessitate a poem? 
 leaving aside the fact that a circle is a line, are we supposed to fill in the blanks ourselves? ""towards"" is a preposition and requires a noun or a pronoun to complete the thought, which i assume in this case is ""you,"" but again - really sloppy syntax. and this is what is so galling and made me so furious reading this collection - the sacrifice of meaning for the sake of rhythm in some instances, while so frequently being cavalier about maintaining consistent rhythm in others. 
 more slipshod scansion, more jacked-up sentence structure. to compete with? to compete for? to compete in? finish your thought. 
 and i know that some people love these poems because omg the feels. and maybe this is a generational thing or a byproduct of people who get book deals based on their internet popularity where there is less editorial oversight, and maybe my complaints about this put me in the same category as people who complain about the infantilization of america with its grown men in baseball caps and those kids and their video games and how all the pop stars are under the drinking age and that's not music why in my day and get off my lawn. but maybe it's just disgust at the fact that people are willingly shelling out seventeen dollars for a hundred or so carelessly-written poems, many of which do not exceed eight lines, and it's the poetic equivalent of nursery food. 
 and that is what i thought of this book. 
 and i know i'm gonna have all these people come out and tell me how much they liked this book and how it changed their life and how wrong i am for scrutinizing it because poetry is like rainbows and it is immune to judgment. and yay for you if you liked this and it had value for you, sincerely. but opinions and an asshole - i have both. and even my asshole thought this collection was unsophisticated and sloppy. 
 ************************************************* 
 2014: 
 pulitzer prize nominee maya angelou, in the year of her death, writes a poem commemorating the life of nobel peace prize recipient nelson mandela, (who died in december 2013, but that's pretty much 2014), and we honor their lives by allowing this to win the 2014 goodreads best poetry award?: 
 stay 
 the words i heard 
 from you today, 
 are said when 
 there's nothing 
 left to say. 
 what i would give 
 to make you stay, 
 i would give it 
 all away. 
 i was hoping i wouldn't have to read this, but goodreads voters have forced my hand. 
 i'll let you know if it's any good. his parents did well naming him shel. 
 he never did care to conform. 
 what would compel a guy to rebel 
 if everyone knew him as norm? student: 
 hey professor, i could use a hand, 
 i just read a play i didn't understand. 
 professor: 
 and what was this play, pray? 
 student: 
 faust, the one you assigned the other day. 
 i simply can't wrap my mind around it; 
 i read it carefully, but i am left confounded. 
 professor: 
 i have, alas, studied philosophy, 
 literature, history, and poetry. 
 i have some time that i can set aside; 
 so i will do my best to be your guide. 
 student: 
 gosh, thanks! so where should i start? 
 i suppose at the most conspicuous part: 
 the language, it was strangely various; 
 both in style and quality, it was multifarious. 
 one moment, it is regal and poetic; 
 other moments it is hasty and frenetic. 
 doggerel alternates with highfalutin; 
 at times colossal, at others lilliputian. 
 professor: 
 perhaps the translation was abysmal? 
 student: 
 actually, i read the german original. 
 professor: 
 ah, i see; please go on. 
 student: 
 i hope you won't think i'm a moron, 
 but i also thought the drama lacking; 
 even though faust does all this yacking 
 about his tortured soul, his weary spirit, 
 i found his actions downright incoherent. 
 he alternately scorns the world and yearns-- 
 for what? what does he wish to learn? 
 although supposedly full of all these riddles, 
 i found him a bit superficial. 
 in short, it's hard to care about his fate, 
 when all he does is whine and prate. 
 professor: 
 what about mephistopheles? 
 student: 
 with him, i was somewhat more pleased. 
 he has at least a bit of spice; 
 his naughtiness is rather nice. 
 professor: 
 and how did you like the plot? 
 student: 
 that actually perplexed me a lot. 
 for one, it's not a tragedy, 
 since the play ends happily. 
 and what was with walpurgis night? 
 yes it was fun, but it didn't seem right 
 to interrupt the action so severely, 
 so pointlessly and cavalierly. 
 some critics admire that scene, ""it's po-mo,"" 
 they say, but i say ""oh, no!"" 
 and what was with valentine? 
 he sticks around for just one scene, 
 and if i am to be concise, 
 he struck me as a plot device. 
 to be honest, from what i gleaned, 
 i can't tell why this is so esteemed. 
 it was nice and all, but i find it queer, 
 that goethe is compared with shakespeare. 
 professor: 
 i can understand the plight you're in, 
 it's hard to know where to begin. 
 goethe is a slippery fellow; 
 reading him is like juggling jello. 
 he was a touch mercurial; 
 often brilliant, occasionally dull. 
 he was a dabbler through and through 
 there wasn't anything he wouldn't do, 
 or at least try; which is partly why 
 the language goes from low to high. 
 student: 
 certainly he was heterogeneous; 
 but why do you think he was a genius? 
 professor: 
 in some ways he was like faust; 
 he studied all, and all renounced. 
 he was skeptical of all modes of thought; 
 and found faults in everything he sought. 
 his distrust of tidiness 
 is why the play is such a mess. 
 if reality is in disarray, 
 so shouldn't be his play? 
 student: 
 this strikes me as just an excuse. 
 professor: 
 everyone is entitled to their views. 
 yet consider goethe's sophistication; 
 in him there is no mystification. 
 in renouncing reason, he does not turn, 
 to superstition, but instead learns 
 to spread his mind in all directions; 
 at once seeking, through reflection, 
 to transcend all worldly views, 
 while remaining coarse and worldly, too. 
 his wisdom soars above, and crawls below; 
 it is both cheap and tawdry, and it glows 
 and grows, expanding ever and anon-- 
 here one moment, in another, gone. 
 he was, in short, a universal man; 
 easy to admire, hard to understand. 
 student: 
 so was he faust or mephisto? 
 professor: 
 he was both, he was both. 
 i highly recommend kaufmann's edition. it has the original german, and his fine translation (which i frequently had to turn to for help) on the facing pages. plus, he includes a finely written, if a bit fawning, introduction. *thank you so much to indigo for surprising me with a copy of this!* 
 i never read milk & honey. it just seemed like such a fad thing, i had no interest in it. i tend to prefer traditional poetry. it's just my inner english major coming out i suppose! that being said, i enjoyed this more than i had expected. i didn't love the whole thing, but there were some poems that i really loved. the poetic style is quite simplistic and some quotes i felt like were reworded versions of things i've seen before. but, i liked the fact that this collection dealt with femininity, immigration, and self love. the topics were well developed and the poems were short, but packed a punch. not sure if i'll now pick up milk & honey. we'll see! milk and honey is a collection of poetry and prose about survival. about the experience of violence, abuse, love, loss, and femininity. it is split into four chapters, and each chapter serves a different purpose. 
 it's difficult trying to review this because every poem is extremely personal, tender and exquisite in its own way. 
 so i decided to feature some of my favorite ones: 
 ""you tell me to quiet down cause 
 my opinions make me less beautiful 
 but i was not made with a fire in my belly 
 so i could be put out 
 i was not made with a lightness on my tongue 
 so i could be easy to swallow 
 i was made heavy 
 half blade and half silk 
 difficult to forget and not easy 
 for the mind to follow"" 
 ""i struggle so deeply 
 to understand 
 how someone can 
 pour their entire soul 
 blood and energy 
 into someone 
 without wanting 
 anything in 
 return 
 - i will have to wait till i'm a mother"" 
 ""when my mother says i deserve better 
 i snap to your defense out of habit 
 he still loves me i shout 
 she looks at me with defeated eyes 
 the way a parent looks at their child 
 when they know this is the type of pain 
 even they can't fix 
 and says 
 it means nothing to me if he loves you 
 if he can't do a single wretched thing about it"" 
 ""he only whispers i love you 
 as he slips his hands 
 down the waistband 
 of your pants 
 this is where you must 
 understand the difference 
 between want and need 
 you may want that boy 
 but you certainly 
 don't need him"" 
 ""i am a museum full of art 
 but you had your eyes shut"" 
 ""people go 
 but how 
 they left 
 always stays"" 
 ""what i miss most is how you loved me. but what i didn't know was how you loved me had so much to do with the person i was. it was a reflection of everything i gave to you. coming back to me. how did i not see that. how. did i sit here soaking in the idea that no one else would love me that way. when it was i that taught you. when it was i that showed you how to fill. the way i needed to be filled. how cruel i was to myself. giving you credit for my warmth simply because you had felt it. thinking it was you who gave me strength. wit. beauty. simply because you recognized it. as if i was already not these things before i met you. as if i did not remain all these once you left."" 
 ""loneliness is a sign you are in desperate need of yourself"" 
 ""you tell me 
 i am not like most girls 
 and learn to kiss me with your eyes closed 
 something about the phrase--something about 
 how i have to be unlike the women 
 i call sisters in order to be wanted 
 makes me want to spit your tongue out 
 like i am supposed to be proud you picked me 
 as if i should be relieved you think 
 i am better than them"" 
 ""other women's bodies 
 are not our battlegrounds"" 
 ""you were a dragon long before 
 he came around and said 
 you could fly 
 you will remain a dragon 
 long after he's left"" 
 ""you look at me and cry 
 everything hurts 
 i hold you and whisper 
 but everything can heal"" 
 ""how you love yourself is 
 how you teach others 
 to love you"" 
 ""what terrifies me most is how we 
 foam at the mouth with envy 
 when others succeed 
 but sigh in relief 
 when they are failing 
 our struggle to 
 celebrate each other is 
 what's proven most difficult 
 in being human"" 
 (most of my favorite quotes were from the healing section, and it was pretty though trying to narrow it down to my preferred quotes.) 
 it also featured some pretty amazing illustrations, which i'm always up for in books: 
 overall, this collection was exquisite and exactly what i needed right now. milk and honey is definitely going to stay on my mind for a while, and i hope to come back to it time and again. 
 4.5 stars

 ugh. so good. i don't have any original insights to share from this most recent of god-knows-how-many readings, but this time through i was really struck by: 
 1) what a damn fine piece of stagecraft this is, from the suspenseful, moody opening on the castle battlements to the solemn dead march carrying the prince offstage, and 
 2) how shakespeare seems to want hamlet's personality--particularly the wellspring of his actions (and lack of action)--to remain an enigma, and that he achieves this by infusing the character with so much of himself--so much wit and poetry, so much despondency and savagery--that the result is that the audience simply bows before the great mystery of human personality, and that this reverence for the unknown lurking in the heart of an extraordinary man intensifies the sense of pity, horror and waste that fills us at the end of the play. well that was underwhelming. 
 i don't really like poetry that much to begin with, but i was so curious about this book after seeing so many people loving it, so i decided to give it a go. i was expecting it to be really profound and ground-breaking and it just wasn't? there were maybe a dozen poems that were quite impactful, but the majority of them felt like filler to me. st@ msrhyt ltshykhwf, knt jmy`h tdwr 'hdthh fy lryf lrwsy. why@ mn yqymwn fy hdh lryf wkl msrhy@ t`lj mwdw` mkhtlf.

 roses are red 
 violets are blue 
 all my base 
 are belong to you. 
 as painfully silly as it is, that little snippet is still significantly better than the poetry in this book. at least it wasn't meant to be taken seriously. unless i've missed something and this book is meant to be some grand satire of the artistic sort. in which case, carry on! 
 if you think this is good poetry: 
 to love him 
 is something 
 i hold highly 
 suspicious. 
 like having something 
 so very delicious--- 
 then being told 
 to do the dishes. 
 and you still think it is good poetry beyond the age of 9, we seriously need to have a talk. and if you are one such person on my friend list, kindly remove yourself from it posthaste. 
 why the fuck is the rating so high? suspicious... i just want to start off by saying that ""through me you enter into the city of woes"" would make an excellent tramp stamp. jump on it! 
 being that i am an atheist living in the ""bible belt,"" i was certain that reading this would lead to some sort of goodreads tirade, which can at times feel about as good as vomiting up a sour stomach or...you know...doing other stuff like shit that ladies don't do. however, i was from the outset hypnotized by dante's tres baudelaire-esque-grotesque imagery and overall style. for such a holy shitfuck, he had quite the murky mind. he was dreaming up torture scenarios that wouldn't even begin to be trumped until gilles de rais and vlad tepes came around, like, a century later. and don't be surprised if he zaps you with the occasional rotting pustule or maggot-infested knife wound. these aren't literal examples, but they illustrate just how the opposite of flowery some of his language is. so i went into reading this with a huge wall up (i know, i know, a terrible way to read), but then i realized that i wasn't just going to be proselytized to...i was going to be threatened with nasty, rotting, coldsore-herpee-mange-pits all over my body that george w. bush and paris hilton are going to take turns pouring their boiling-hot-diarrhea-snot into. dante, you sick bastard! awesome!!! 
 so onward i galloped, discerning through all the filthy language that: 
 a) i am, in fact, going to hell. 
 b) they will have trouble determining the circle i will end up in because i could be placed in every single one of them save maybe, like, one or two (i stopped counting after awhile). 
 c) the dalai lama, too, is going to hell.* 
 *in fact, the ""higher-ups"" are apparently so sadistic, they sent people to hell who had lived morally just lives but were born before the coming of christ! he'll punish you for not worshiping him before you even know who he is!!! if there was ever a better use for ""wtf?"", i don't know what it is. that's like your mom smacking you in the mouth for getting pregnant while you're still a virgin, or like wanting to ban a book that you haven't even seen in real life yet! that means that every intelligent being for the first few billions of years is in hell right now! all of 'em!!! every evolutionary step forward up to the first homosapien christian is a batch of poor bastards that has been ferried across the river styx. harsh. 
 i mean seriously...even moses and noah were in hell until jesus came through with the vip passes. apparently, the wholly omniscient creator forgot to put them on the guest list. ain't that some shit? 
 one specific gripe about the story...i'm not digging this whole ""emasculated devil"" thing. i mean, wallowing in your own filth freezing your ass off with bitch-tears in your eyes at all times? this is the malevolent force that the christians live in constant fear of, seriously? it's a non-stop temptation to be like him? come on, everybody knows the devil is confusingly sexy and he likes to smoke fancy cigars and drink brandy and wear fine suits and tell hilarious jokes. how else is he supposed to charm us away from the true path? keep up, dante...sheesh. 
 forgive me, father, for i have sinned. the end! 
 oh, and if you hated this review, i have a back-up review below: 
 ""papa said knock you out"" (aka ""the inferno"") 
 by lil' j.c.

 ____________________________________ 
 1 when i use the first-person singular pronoun, i am here referring to my normal persona. i have also, at various times, maintained other personas. for example, between 1999 and 2001, i used to play chess regularly on the kasparovchess site under the handle ""swedish_chick"". 
 i find this a strange example of what makes people believe things. everyone was extremely skeptical on first meeting her; but, for some reason, as soon as they discovered that she actually could speak fluent swedish, they were also ready to believe that she was an attractive 26 year old graduate student living in stockholm. i still can't explain why this might be. 
 2 people liked hearing stories about chick, as she was known to my circle of friends. at the time, i was working at a start-up in cambridge, england, and one of my colleagues was a young woman i will call g. g took a lively interest in chick, and helped me considerably with the development of the back-story. chick borrowed several features from her; in particular, everyone, for some reason, wanted to know if chick was blonde, and the agreed-on answer was ""yes, during the summer at least."" even more remarkably, g began to acquire features from chick, which went as far as learning swedish and moving to linkoping in order to do a phd there. 
 3 the stories about chick would fill a small book. she was a charming person, and i've often wished that i were as nice as she was. she was always happy to play chess with lower-rated players, and commented encouragingly on their progress. when people became abusive, as inevitably happens on the web, she never lost her cool. she would occasionally give regular opponents glimpses of her private life, but only after she had known them for some time and felt she could trust them. the back-story was in fact quite complicated, even though it was hardly ever used; she was bisexual, and had a female lover in california that she sometimes visited. no one was ever told this straight out, however. 
 it was inevitable that men would fall for this wonderfully attractive person. the first time, i managed to hide successfully, and he went away after a while. (she had poignantly reminded him of a brief encounter he had had many years ago, that he'd always regretted not following up). the second time, it was too complicated. her admirer was a regular habitue of kasparovchess and kept pestering her for a date in real life. he offered to take her on vacation in germany and seemed completely smitten. with great regret, we had to terminate chick. 
 4 one day at work, we were discussing clerihews. we looked up some examples on the web. suddenly, g started laughing uncontrollably; she had been visited by divine inspiration! she rushed to her laptop, and shortly afterwards mailed out the following very fine poem: 
 manny rayner, could be saner 
 plays chess, in a dress. 
 my friend is nothing if not pc. i'm sorry that i can't remember the exact text of the accompanying note, but she made it clear that she was not literally implying that i wore women's clothes when i impersonated chick, and that, if i had chosen to do so, she would have regarded it as a completely defensible exercise of my right to wear apparel that expressed my personality in whatever way i chose. 
 this review is in my book what pooh might have said to dante and other futile speculations ""you can recognize a small truth because its opposite is a falsehood. the opposite of a great truth is another truth."" 
 - niels bohr 
 i was thinking about dante the other day and wondering how one could approach him from the angle of a goodreads review. one of the obvious problems is that he lived a long time ago, and many of the cultural referents have changed. you're constantly having to think ""well, nowadays what he's saying would correspond to that"". it isn't so bad in hell, when there is plenty of entertainment to be had in seeing how the different sins are punished, and indulging your schadenfreude. then purgatory tells a moral story that's more or less timeless if you go for that sort of thing, but once you arrive in paradise it starts getting seriously tricky. a lot of the stuff at first sight just seems irrelevant to the 21st century world... all these explanations about the mechanics of ptolomaic astronomy, and dante querying the inhabitants of heaven on obscure theological points. it's notorious that readers most often give up somewhere in the third book. i started wondering if there was any modern-day author one could identify with dante, and if that might help us connect to his concerns. and in fact, i do have a suggestion that some people will no doubt condemn out of hand as completely heretical: richard dawkins. 
 now of course, i am aware that dante was deeply immersed in the christian world-view, and dawkins is famous for being the world's most outspoken atheist. but it's not quite as crazy as it first may seem. dante was a christian to the core of his being, but he was furious with the way the church was being run; he put several of its leaders, notably pope boniface viii, in hell. on the other side, i challenge anyone to read ""the ancestor's tale"" to the end, and not, at least for a moment, entertain the idea that dawkins is in actual fact a deeply religious man. he admits as much himself: as he puts it, it's often not so much that he disagrees with conventionally religious people, more that ""they are saying it wrong"". amen to that. 
 as noted, both dante and dawkins are extremely unhappy with the way mainstream religion is being organized. the other characteristic that unites them for me is this passionate love for science. one has to remember that, for dante, ptolomaic astronomy was state of the art stuff, and the details of the angelic hierarchy were a topic of vital importance; of course he cross-examines the hosts of the blessed to find out more. these days, i imagine he would be trying to get inside information on what happened during the big bang before spontaneous symmetry breaking occurred, whether or not the higgs particle really exists, and how evolution produced human intelligence. for dante, there didn't seem to be any opposition between religious faith and science - they were part of the same thing. i do wonder what he would have thought if he had been able to learn that many leading religious figures, even in the early 21st century, reject a large part of science as being somehow unreligious. it's wrong to spend your life dispassionately trying to understand god's universe? i can see him getting quite angry about this, and deciding to rearrange the seating a little down in hell. 
 i keep thinking that there's a book someone ought to write called ""five atheists you'll meet in heaven"". please let me know when it comes out; i'll buy a copy at once. 
 ************************************** 
 ps i couldn't help wondering what paradise might have looked like if dante had been writing today. obviously we wouldn't have the old geocentric model of the universe - it would be bang up to date. i think there is now far more material for an ambitious poet to work with than there was in the 14th century. for example, when we get to the heaven of the galaxy, i imagine him using this wonderful fact that all the heavy elements are made in supernova explosions. ""we are all stardust"", as some people like to put it. then when we get to the heaven of the cosmos, we find that the light from the ""let there be light"" moment at the beginning of creation is still around - it's just cooled to 2.7 degrees k, and appears as the cosmic background radiation. but it's not completely uniform, as the quantum fluctuations left over from the period when the universe was the size of an atomic nucleus are the beginnings of the galaxies created on the second day. finally, we reach the heaven of the multiverse, and find that we are just one of many different universes. it was necessary to create all of them, so that random processes could make sure that a very small number would end up being able to support life. how impious to assume that god would only be able to create one universe, and have to tweak all the constants himself! ybq~ lmhn mhn wn tmt` shbh bb`d lthqf@ 'w lblg@

 fy 20 fbryr 2015 there's all this debate over why satan is so appealing in paradise lost. did milton screw up? is he being cynical, or a double-secret atheist? and why is god such a dick? 
 but no one asks whether, say, shakespeare screwed up in making iago so much fun; they just give him credit for writing an awesome villain. and that's all milton's doing. satan is tempting for us because satan is tempting for us. that's the point of satan! if milton didn't make him as appealing as possible, he'd be doing satan a disservice. and eve, for that matter. 
 similarly, god's a dick because god's a dick. you've read the old testament. he's not exactly all flowers and hugs there either. again, milton's just being true to his characters, and writing a great story while he's at it. 
 there's slightly more to it than that, yeah. for example: it's hinted a little that god sets satan up to fall. he gives a stern warning that anyone who disobeys him or his son will be cast out of heaven. but since there's no sin or evil at the time of his speech, why give the warning? isn't that like saying ""don't touch these cookies while i'm gone"" to a kid who didn't realize there were cookies until you pointed them out? 
 here's my advice to people considering reading paradise lost: read the first two books. it starts with a bang, and it's pretty amazing for a while. it slows down a bit in books iii - vii, so if you're not totally sold in the first two books (i was), you can either quit altogether with a fair idea of what milton sounds like, or skip to books ix and x. ix is the actual temptation and fall (especially fun if you're a misogynist), and x is an astonishing sequence where adam and eve contemplate suicide: 
 ""why am i mocked with death, and lengthened out 
 to deathless pain? how gladly would i meet 
 mortality my sentence... 
 his dreadful voice no more 
 would thunder in my ears."" (adam, x.774 - 780) 
 ""we've totally mucked this up, and our kids are gonna justifiably hate us because we got kicked out of paradise, and maybe we should just quit while we're behind."" 
 but really, the whole thing is worth it. took me a while - it's intense stuff, so i found that i had to read a book and then chew on it for a while to process it before moving to the next one - but it's cool. 
 in book viii, if you're cosmologically minded, milton lays out the whole universe. like giordano bruno, he understands that our earth is a tiny speck in the universe, and he gets that all the stars are suns like ours, and therefore could have planets like ours around them. he also thinks they might be inhabited; our species might not be god's only experiment. elsewhere, other adams and eves may have faced the same test of the tree of knowledge - and they might have passed it. isn't that an amazing thought? 
 in books xi and xii, michael tells adam sortof all the rest of the stories in the old testament, which of course boil down to: 
 ""so shall the world go on, 
 to good malignant, to bad men benign, 
 under her own weight groaning."" (xii 537 - 539) 
 that's your fault there, adam. nice work. 
 he rushes through them though, and it makes me wonder whether milton had originally intended to retell the entire old testament but got bored or intimidated or something. that would've been remarkable. certainly paradise lost is better literature than the old testament is, and significantly more coherent. 
 it's also better literature than almost everything else. second-best poem by a blind guy ever. i have conquered the iliad. i can truly call myself a greek mythology lover now. 
 angst, love, honor, angst, family, drama, death, angst. did i mention angst? no, i'm not talking about beverly hills, 90210. oh ancient greece, you were a very mixed up angsty place. 
 this is basically how it went down. (these memes are dark and full of spoilers) 
 i've said it before and i'll say it again. i was born too late. where's the tardis when you need it? milk and honey tore through my analytical mind and burrowed deep into my ultra-sensitive soul. it slayed all my emotions, my feminist desires, and my love for vulnerable writing. i may not know a lot about poetry, but i do know a decent amount about feelings, and rupi kaur brought all my feelings tumbling out with this gorgeous collection of poems. she writes about love and loss, trauma, and femininity - subjects that i so happen to adore. in spare yet thorough language, she addresses what it feels like to be broken, to be loved, and to be stronger on one's own. this collection, while in many ways simple, addresses some of the darkest and most hopeful matters of the human heart. if you enjoy marinating in your feelings or if you often ponder topics like female empowerment, getting over heartbreak, or what it means to love, i would recommend you check out milk and honey asap. now i will include three of my favorite poems, though i wish i could include them all. 
 on calling women pretty: 
 ""i want to apologize to all the women 
 i have called pretty 
 before i've called them intelligent or brave 
 i am sorry i made it sound as though 
 something as simple as what you're born with 
 is the most you have to be proud of when your 
 spirit has crushed mountains 
 from now on i will say things like 
 you are resilient or you are extraordinary 
 not because i don't think you're pretty 
 but because you are so much more than that"" 
 on co-dependency: 
 ""you are in the habit 
 of co-depending 
 on people to 
 make up for what 
 you think you lack 
 who tricked you 
 into believing 
 another person 
 was meant to complete you 
 when the most they can do is complement"" 
 on what is most important: 
 ""most importantly love 
 like it's the only thing you know how 
 at the end of the day all this 
 means nothing 
 this page 
 where you're sitting 
 your degree 
 your job 
 the money 
 nothing even matters 
 except love and human connection 
 who you loved 
 and how deeply you loved them 
 how you touched the people around you 
 and how much you gave them"" l'n lnfs lt~ tr~ zl llh mr@ l tkhsh~ b`d dhlk 'shbh l'bls@ .. wl`yn lt~ tkthl blmh@ whd@ mn lml' l'`l~ l tgmdh 'wj` hdh l`lm

 eh...homer's right. odysseus' version is better. 
 p.s. do not try this story at home unless, when you get there, you're still capable of shooting your arrow into a narrow aperture. 
 fagles' translation is excellent - the new standard - and bernard knox's enormous introduction is the best homeric essay i've ever read. 
 a good companion read is hal roth's we followed odysseus - maybe not the most eloquent of books, but he retraces odysseus's voyage (as best he can) in his sailboat, which is a pretty rad idea. i recreated his route as a google map here, with notes on each of the stops. i also wrote summaries of each book of the odyssey for a book club discussion; i've pasted them in the comments thread below, if you're interested. okay. yeah. that was....well, not my favorite ever thing. i feel like i just read my middle school aim away messages or 200 pages of emo myspace updates. i need to go listen to some dashboard confessional stat. 
 i love the idea. i love the sentiments and the lessons, and certainly the feminist ideas at work here. if i saw any of the platitudes expressed in the ""you"" section on tumblr, i'd happily reblog them. i definitely appreciate the raw emotions that very clearly went into the writing of them, and how personal the author was willing to get about her life. but. um. ummmmmmmmm. what the fuck. 
 but that...well. that's just not the kind of poetry i respond to. i find minimalist poetry extremely hit or miss, and when i (very rarely) read poetry, it's usual the lusher, more ornate kind--or at least the more visually creative. because this...i mean, there's nothing new here. it's generic tumblr platitudes. it's emo angst that should be emblazoned over a picture of a sad girl on the beach and put on pinterest. it's beyond basic metaphors and cliche imagery about hearts and stars and oceans. it's

 deep. 
 to me that's just a waste of trees, but hey, to each their own. 
 again, i appreciate the raw angst here, but it's pretty clunky. there's no subtlety or nuance, which is why it makes me think of 13 year old me, just scribbling out pure feelings to the page because it was the only person who'd listen and all the feelings felt so new. which, i mean, thank you for the nostalgia, if that's what was intended, but as a book of poetry--sophisticated poetry for the modern feminist--it's a hard pass. i mean, this book of poetry even touched on things that are very personal to me, like grief, but i got zero feels. it was all so distant and buried in cliches. 
 examples: 
 everyone i love leaves. 
 i...what? what peyton sawyer bullshit is this? that's the whole poem?? one tree hill was wangsting like this ten years ago.

 lw nn lm nftrq inspired by paul legault's brilliant idea of translating emily dickinson's poems into english, i thought immediately - i have to steal that idea. so here are some of the ariel poems of sylvia plath translated into english. i have, of course, tried my utmost to perform this task with tact, discretion and good taste. 
 ariel translated into english 
 elm. 
 look, let's get this straight. i am a tree, you are a woman. we can never be together, not in the way you'd like, anyway. plus, you're kind of irritating. 
 the rabbit catcher 
 i went out with this guy once and then i found out he liked to catch rabbits. so he was toast. i should have dimed the bastard. 
 berck-plage 
 i went on holiday. every single person in the whole hotel was talking about me behind my back. i don't like bikinis. don't even get me started on nude beaches. 
 the other 
 i have something dead in my handbag. tee hee. also, i scratched myself and made myself bleed. i don't really recommend marriage. 
 a birthday present 
 i got a present. but i was thinking that if i unwrapped it, it would bite my face off. so i didn't. hah. 
 the bee meeting 
 i thought i'd like to join in village life and get involved with local societies and all that. so i went to the bee keepers' meeting. it was like something out of alfred hitchcock. i liked it. 
 stings 
 now i'm a real bee keeper. i get blase about stings. it's like a metaphor. 
 the swarm 
 bees are kind of like nazis. or the french. i can't decide. 
 wintering 
 country life can suck. i wish i was a bee. no, i don't really. that would be silly. i think it would be silly. maybe it wouldn't be silly. 
 a secret 
 men are like big babies that drink beer and want you to wear high class lingerie. okay, that's not much of a secret. 
 the applicant 
 i got this job as a temp. so i was filing and i knew i could destroy them if i chose, just like that, but i didn't choose to that day. 
 daddy 
 when i was little and my dad used to dress up in his ss uniform i used to think he looked so smart and handsome. of course, later, the penny dropped. 
 lesbos 
 you really shouldn't have taken the kittens and given them to the neighbours without a by-your-leave. i think i am going to pour sulphuric acid on your head while you are sleeping. i'll do it tonight. yes. 
 fever 103 
 i got one of those 48 hour bugs. that's why he's still alive. if i had any strength in my limbs i would have sulphuric-acided his head last night. 
 cut 
 i nearly cut my fucking thumb off when i was making a casserole for a man. i jumped about swearing. i could have cut off something useful, like his member, but no, it had to be my thumb. 
 poppies in october 
 have you noticed that everything is slowly dying of carbon-monoxide poisoning? 
 lady lazarus 
 i like to commit suicide like some people like to visit their grandparents. you really don't want to, it's kind of a drag and there's nothing to do there, but you just feel you have to because you're a good person. 
 letter in november 
 dear ted - fuck you - sylvia 
 death & co 
 cheer up, things could be worse, i could be dead. oh no, wait a minute - this is worse, that would be better. hmm. 
 sheep in fog 
 well, you know sheep aren't that bright to begin with. so when you mix 'em up with a thick fog, the results are hilarious. goodreads should have a shelf for ""continually reading"". i think i have about six different translations of the bhagavad gita but i often end up with eknath easwaran's for its simplicity. this is the book i re-read when i am writing a novel. it keeps everything in perspective by reminding me to offer my effort to god, to see my work as a service to others, and to not worry about what happens after that. the princess saves herself in this one was a fairly emotional read for me. this poetry collection is divided into four different parts: the princess, the damsel, the queen, & you. and there were a lot of parts that really hit home (especially the princess), so much so that i had to put the collection down for a minute and think. 
 the princess saves herself in this one explores life & all of its love, loss, grief, healing, empowerment, & inspirations. and i loved and felt everything deeply. 
 here are a few poems that made me both contemplate and feel: 
 overall, this collection harrowed and punctured my heart deeply. 
 *note: i'm an amazon affiliate. if you're interested in buying the princess saves herself in this one, just click on the image below to go through my link. i'll make a small commission!* 
 this review and more can be found on my blog. now that i'm reading the prophet again, words that i read twenty-seven years ago still ring clearly in my mind as i read them again today. it was a wonderful moment a few evenings ago to find myself reciting aloud and from memory passages that had struck me then--and now--to the very core. kahlil gibran spent a couple of years revising the prophet. since it is a short book, the concepts come across as distilled. the influences of his native lebanon as well as his love for scripture, come through in the scriptural-like language. i am savoring this book slowly this time, taking little sips at a time.

 =) i not only really like shakespeare's coriolanus: i also like the man coriolanus as he is revealed in the play. sure, he may be a hothead, an arrogant bully, an immature mama's boy with a proto-fascist personality, but he is also a man of extraordinary physical courage and sincere personal modesty who would like nothing better than to do his warrior's duty and be left alone. 
 unfortunately, though, his mother--whose values are also those of the roman republic--sees her son's patrician duty as including a consulship, and the populist politicking it requires--which a proud and simple man like coriolanus can only experience as self-abasement--inevitably leads to his shame and eventually to his destruction. he cannot be true both to his mother and his republic and to himself--and that is his tragedy. 
 the verse of this play is often harsh and crabbed, but it is a monumental crabbedness, an imposing harshness--very much like the personality of its hero. i've been reading this book for almost three years and it feels so good to finally have finished it! 
 i was surprised by what i found in here. poe was slightly different to what i thought. he is very much shrouded in shadow and the macabre, at least, his more successful stories and poems were. but there were also some very basic stories in here, some that felt like they weren't even written by the same person. for every great piece of literature, there were two mediocre ones. i disliked the crime stories in particular. the best ones, for me, were the ones where the narrator laments a lost love on the cusp of insanity: these stories were simply beautiful. 
 here's my top two, the only two i consider to be literary perfection: 
 the raven 
 shall we descend into madness? shall we be haunted by our own desires? shall we be consumed by that terrible facet of life known only as death? shall we cling to what cannot be reanimated? shall we wish for a return of something that has long been in darkness? 
 shall we become obliterated by the brutal finality of such a statement as ""nevermore?"" 
 lenore has gone. she has departed from this life, and is permanently out of the reach of the man. the raven represents the solidarity of this. despite how much he longs for the impossible, despite how much he hopes for something that could never occur, he still has that inclination that the fantastical could happen: he has to believe that she could come back. and the raven represents the voice of reason, the voice of actuality. and it kills him. it is pain, despair, melancholy and a spiritual death all rolled into one haunting feathery package. 
 he rebels against this voice of rationality. he knows the voice speaks the truth, but he cannot simply accept it. he has lost something vital; he has lost part of himself that will never grace his presence again. and he clings to hope, a false hope such as it is. the raven smashes this to oblivion; it destroys any last semblance of the miraculous occurring. it makes the man realise that this is life, not some whimsical world where nothing bad ever happens. people die. people we love die. nothing can change that. lenore will never walk through his chamber door again, and the reality drives him into madness. it shatters his life. 
 ""and the raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting 
 on the pallid bust of pallas just above my chamber door; 
 and his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming, 
 and the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor; 
 and my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor 
 shall be lifted- nevermore!"" 
 his soul will never lift anymore; hope shall never be lifted anymore. by the end of the poem he has full realised the reality of the situation. the raven, the dark bird of harsh truth, the harbinger of the words he simply doesn't want to hear, has become demonised. it has become the very object he did not want to face; he created a sense of longing to protect himself from the emotional loss of lenore, and this bubble of falsehood has been burst. reality sets in, and it is a fate worse than death. it is one of persecution and mental chaos as the bird is simply unable to supply the man with all his answers. he is driven mad by the unknown. 
 the man in the poem has lost ""lenore."" but, what is this lenore? is she a woman? is she this man's lost love? or is she something much, much, more? i think on the surface level of the poem she is his dead wife. but the archaic references speak of something else. lenore could perhaps be a universal suggestion of a lost sense of self or even humanity. we are no longer what we once were. it is also rather significant that the man is persecuted only by the natural world. very much in the romanticism vein, man stands aside from nature. he has become something different with his modernisation and industrialisation. 
 he walks outside his nature. and poe, being an anti-transcendentalism thinker (a dark romantic), demonstrates that life isn't all sunshine and roses, and nor could it ever be. it is pessimism in full force, and although i strongly disagree with the outlook on life, and appreciate the idealistic utopia offered in the poetry of percy shelley and other romantics much more, i do love the dark beauty of this poem. the finality of the phrase ""nevermore"" is nothing short of maddening reality for our lost man. it is the end of hope. 
 ligeia 
 if a mind has found the most true and profound bliss what happens when it's taken away? 
 well, the simple answer is it doesn't work anymore, at least not very well. the narrator of this marvellous short story experiences a whole host of emotions and mental states after his loss. firstly, he is hit with the expected wave of melancholy fuelled by his understandable grief; secondly, he feels the slow calm breeze of acceptance; thirdly, and finaly, he is savaged by an unrealised state of delusion and fantasy. in this, edgar allan poe demonstrates his true mastery of writing a character in different states of mental stability. needless to say, he's a remarkable writer. 
 in beauty of face no maiden ever equaled her. it was the radiance of an opium-dream - and airy and spirit-lifting vision more wildly divine than the phantasies which hovered about the slumbering souls of the daughters of delos. yet her features were not of that regular mould which we have been falsely taught to worship in the classical labors of the heathen."" 
 the narrator cannot be blamed for his fragility. he has lost his world: he has lost his beloved ligeia. she was everything to him, and they both knew it. nothing could lessen the blow of her death; nothing could take the pain away of her upcoming demise: nothing could save his mind in a world without her. they were living in harmony; their souls had achieved happiness and love; they were two lesser beings of one greater soul: they were at peace in their own transcendental plane, until she died. so, the narrator's sense of self awareness and actuality has been destroyed. he is left with the tatters of a wonderful experience, and his own delusion. 
 i recommend looking at the following quote and considering exactly who is speaking, and why he would conjure up such an image. perhaps, he didn't fantasise this. maybe this is paranormal. i do love the multiplicity of its interpretation. 
 this short story is a marvel. it appears confusing and contradictory, but if you stop and consider who is actually speaking then its true nature is revealed. admittedly, on my first read i was a little lost, though after a second read i began to see it for what it was. this is not as approachable as some of poe's other works, and it really isn't an advisable starting point for the author. but, the short story is wonderful, truly wonderful. it highlights the working of the mind in a state of sheer depravity; it is disturbing and brilliant. 
 postscript 
 it seems to me that the more popular stories were the more effective ones. the only one with little renown that was brilliant was ligeia. i'm glad i read the entire thing, but some of the works were entirely forgettable. there two, though, will be works i certainly will be reading again in the future. absolute nonsense, which is to be expected with carroll. i love how his writing brings me back to being a kid again. obviously loved it! on the battlefield of goodreads, the mighty reviewer arjuna picked up his trusty pen, gandeeva, and addressed his charioteer (who was none other than lord krishna): 
 - o kesava! take me to the middle of the battlefield, between the opposing armies of authors and reviewers, so that i may see who i am fighting against. 
 and krishna did so. 
 but arjuna, seeing all his favourite authors arrayed against him, was suddenly loath to fight. - o krishna! he said. how will i use my cruel pen to tear into these dear ones? how will i lay bare their plots, deconstruct their sentences, and take their grammar apart? no, i do not want the glory and likes obtained by such a heinous act! better a brain-death, reading trash, than such sin! and he threw his pen down. 
 krishna smiled and stood up. 
 - o partha! such faintheartedness is not worthy of a warrior like you! do you think that you destroy books through your reviews? banish such foolishness from your mind! 
 those reviewers who think that they are destroying books, and those authors who believe their books are getting destroyed through reviews, both are equally mistaken: for books are neither created nor destroyed through reviews. 
 for the book which is published, oblivion is certain: and for that which goes out of print, rebirth is certain. but the story never dies: like human beings change worn clothes, it only changes publishers and dust jackets. 
 the narrative cannot be destroyed by weapons: it cannot be burnt by fire (read fahrenheit 451!), it is not drowned in water. it is eternal. 
 so your karma, o kaunteya, is to do the review without worrying about its fruits. do not think of the likes you are going to get: do not worry whether the author is going to find you out and conk you on the head: do not trouble your mind about whether people will be put off from reading the book because of your review. go into it without attachment: this is the way of the kshatriya. this is ""nishkama-karma"", the way to eternal glory! 
 hearing this, arjuna was heartened. he picked up his pen, and started to review with renewed vigour. 
 review inspired by manny i disagree with greg. 
 when i was thirteen, i had a journal. and i would lie on my tummy and kick my feet in the air and record my tiny thoughts. 
 when i was fifteen, i had a journal. and i would smoke a joint and lie on my tummy and record my huge earthshattering thoughts. 
 when i was nineteen, i had a journal. and - well, let's save something for the biopic, shall we? 
 i don't have a journal anymore. and you know why? 
 because i write huge purple monsters of sentences and only end up making myself small and shy when i come across them years later. 
 this book suffers from many of these sentences. 
 i should have known from the first page: 
 i am standing on a corner in monterey, waiting for the bus to come in, and all the muscles of my will are holding my terror to face the moment i most desire. 
 ugh. i can feel raymond carver hurling an empty bottle of booze at this sentence in disgust, and for once, i am with him. 
 there is a way to be evocative and complicated and beautiful all at once, ""the smile on your face was the deadest thing alive enough to have the strength to die,"" anyone?? 
 this?? this ain't that. and as an opening sentence it just stuck in my craw and tainted the rest of the book. 
 i like crisp prose, clean lines, smart phrasings. this seemed too self-indulgent - too emotionally bloated.too much ""why use one word when you can use ten and still say nothing??"" going on. 
 not god, but bats and a spider who is weaving my guilt, keep the rendezvous with me, and shame copulates with every september housefly. my room echoes with the screams she never uttered, and under my floor the vines of remorse get ready to push up through the damp. the cricket drips remembrance unceasingly into my ear, lest i mislay any items of cruelty's fiendish inventory. 
 oh, yeah?? is that what shame does?? it copulates with houseflies, does it?? gosh, i hope the maggot gets shame's eyes...i have no patience for this sort of thing. 
 fear will be a terrible fox at my vitals under my tunic of behaviour. 
 i say no thank you. 
 brigid brophy's introduction is excellent. i read it last, of course, and it made me appreciate the book so much more in retrospect, and it also reminded me of the several parts i did enjoy. but i have to give it two stars, because i really didn't enjoy reading it. there were moments of great beauty, but too many parts where i was just gagging on her prose. i am all for pain and howling emotions,but isn't it the responsibility of the writer to marry the vulnerable raw nerves with craft?? it is true there were many moments where i was totally on-board with her writing, but when it was bad, it was very very bad. 
 and, oh, what's this?? 
 someone has come to interrupt my ravings...it's me - a week later! 
 okay, so i have been really sad for a couple of days now. and i have reread great swathes of this book under the influence of my own ragged emotions.and i am ashamed to admit that i like it more now. i have to keep the two-stars for that is how i felt when i really read it, but might i suggest reading this when you are in the throes of some sort of emotional tidal wave?? it was not meant for happy eyes. although there still isn't any shame copulating with any houseflies here at my place. fy msr t'khdh mn dm lsh`b thmn nfq hkmh

 mn 'jl bq lry'ys fy lslt@ dante's inferno - the first book i was assigned to read in my high school world literature class. back then i couldn't get over how much the emotion of fear set the tone as i read each page. i recently revisited this classic. rather than a more conventional review - after all, there really is nothing i can add as a way of critical commentary -- as a tribute to the great poet, i would like to share the below microfiction i wrote a number of years ago: 
 joyride 
 one balmy july evening at a seaside amusement park, hector and his date strolled past the merry-go-round, toddlers' swings and tooting fire engine out to the more hair-raising rides. at the very end of the pier, beyond the wild mouse and giant ferris wheel, there was a new roller coaster that looked pretty frightening. not only did the tracks have steep climbs and amazing plunges but there was an opening in the boardwalk where the roller coaster took its passengers under the pier. 
 ""look,"" hector said, pointing to the hole in the boardwalk, ""i've never seen a roller coaster whose tracks go beneath the surface."" 
 ""oh!"" his date squealed, eager for as much of a thrill as the amusements had to offer, ""that must really be scary. let's go."" 
 they took their place in line behind the last thrill-seeker and watched as the roller coaster ascended, hurled down and sped around hairpin turns, finally climbing the highest hump of track and descending to where the track ran beneath the pier. hector looked over at the spot in the boardwalk from which the train would eventually reemerge. he waited and waited. this was taking much more time than he though. 
 hector's girlfriend squeezed his hand. ""wow! i bet they're really getting spooked down there."" 
 hector heard shrieks coming from some place underneath their feet - shrieks not of delight or pleasure but shrieks to make your blood run cold. 
 ""oh, i can't wait!"" his date said, tugging at his shirtsleeve. 
 hector crouched down to hear the shrieks and howls more clearly. waves of heat rising from the spaces between the wooden boards of the boardwalk burned his face. after several uneasy moments he stood back up and watched as the roller coaster finally rolled through the cavernous opening in the boardwalk and stopped near the line. 
 all of the passengers' faces were ashen and a middle-aged woman in the front seat was weeping on her husband's shoulder. 
 ""this must really be something,"" hector's date said. 
 one terrified passenger unbuckled herself and climbed out. she walked past, eyes downcast, and hector could both see and smell her hair was singed. 
 and if this wasn't enough, the cheerless bearded man running the ride collected everyone's tickets and pronounced lots would be drawn to determine who would have to ride in the first car. hector's date called out that if nobody else wanted, she would gladly volunteer for the front seat. 
 when the old man nodded, she pulled hector by the hand to the front of the roller coaster and strapped him in next to her. hector noticed for the first time the name of this ride - spelled out in red iridescent letters over their heads was ""dante's inferno."" 
 hector slunk down in his seat next to his girlfriend, who was now giggling and playfully poking him in the ribs. as the roller coaster began moving, hector tried to console himself with the grim fact that everyone on the preceding ride did at least come back alive. i'm not a huge poetry person, but i just had to buy this book after hearing so many people talking about it. it didn't disappoint in anyway. the poetry in this book is so raw and beautiful that i related to so many that i kept going back to reread my favorites and highlight and tab them. outstanding collection of poems. so much soul. so much intelligence in how parker folds in cultural references and the experiences of black womanhood. every poem will get its hooks into you. and of course, the poems about beyonce are the greatest because beyonce is our queen. pablo picasso spent his entire life trying desperately to do something new, something unique. he moved from style to style, mastering and then abandoning both modern and classical methods, even trying to teach his trained artist's hand to paint like a child. 
 in 1940, four french teens and a dog stumbled upon a cave that had lain hidden for 16,000 years. inside, they found the walls covered in beautiful drawings of men and animals. when the lascaux caves were opened to the public, pablo picasso visited them, and as he stared at the prehistoric hunting scenes, was heard to remark in a despondent tone: ""we have invented nothing"". 
 the iliad is equally as humbling to a writer, as complex, beautiful, and honest as any other work. the war scenes play out like a modern film, gory and fast-paced, the ever-present shock of death. though some have been annoyed at how each man is named (or even given a past) before his death, this gives weight to the action. each death is has consequence, and as each man steps onto the stage to meet glory or death, homer gives us a moment to recognize him, to see him amidst the whirling action, and to witness the fate zeus metes. 
 the psychological complexity and humanism of this work often shocked me. homer's depiction of human beings as fundamentally flawed and unable to direct their own lives predicts existentialism. the even hand he gives both the trojans and the argives places his work above the later moralizing allegories of turold, tasso, or even milton. 
 of course, homer's is a different world than theirs, one where the sword has not yet become a symbol for righteousness. in homer, good men die unavenged, and bad men make their way up in the world. noble empires fall to ravenous fire and the corpses of fresh-limbed young men are desecrated. 
 fate does not favor the kind, the weak, the moral, or even the strong. fate favors some men now, others later, and in the end, none escapes the emptiness of death. though homer paints some men as great, as noble and kind and brave, these men do not uphold these ideals for some promised paradise, but simply because they are such men. 
 there is something refreshing in the purity of the philosophy of living life for yourself and yet expecting no entitlement for your deeds. a philosophy which accepts the uncontrollable winds of fate; that when the dark mist comes across our eyes, no man knows whence he goes. 
 later traditions make other claims: that the righteous will be rewarded, that the lives of good men will be good and the bad will be punished. in thousands of years of thinking, of writing, of acting, have we gained nothing but comforting, untenable ideals? then picasso was wrong, we have invented something, but it is only a machine which perpetuates itself by peddling self-satisfaction. 
 i read and enjoyed the fagles translation, which may not be the most faithful, but strikes that oft-discussed balance between joy of reading and fidelity. he makes no attempt to translate the meter into english, which is a blessing to us. the english language does a few meters well, and homer's is not one of them. 
 the footnotes were competent and interesting, though i could have stood a few more of them; perhaps i am in the minority. i also thoroughly enjoyed knox's introductory essay. i would normally have had to research the scholarly history of the book myself, and so knox's catch-me-up was much appreciated.

 outstanding book. so why did the ancient mariner shoot the albatross? 
 to me the answer is simple. he did it because he could; he did it because is he is a man, and that's what men do: he saw something beautiful; he saw perfection in nature, and he killed it. that's humanity for you. sinning is easily, as quickly as a finger click: it happens just like that. there's little thought involved. for the mariner it is spontaneity itself; it's in his nature to destroy. the shooting of the bird suggests that all sin is the same; it's so very easy to be evil in the face of opportunity. 
 ""and i had done a hellish thing, 
 and it would work 'em woe: 
 for all averred, i had killed the bird 
 that made the breeze to blow. 
 ah wretch! said they, the bird to slay, 
 that made the breeze to blow!"" 
 the bird is suggestive of a christian soul; the mariner shoots in regardless. he doesn't care. remorse comes later, but can it be called true remorse? it is only born out of regret because of the dire situation he is placed in because of his wanton act. is this remorse or self-pity? is he merely regretful because he wishes to be saved? the other sailors hang the bird round his neck, to represent a cross to show that they had no part in the deed. but, they didn't care before; they had a pack mentality, to kill so mercilessly was a joke; it was fun to be in a position of power. however, when the scales are turned they realise the error of their ways. is empathy that hard to develop? do they have to be in a dire situation to understand brutality? 
 ""ah! well a-day! what evil looks 
 had i from old and young! 
 instead of the cross, the albatross 
 about my neck was hung."" 
 before the shooting of the bird the world is a wonder. the ice is picturesque; it is sea is green like an emerald and the sun is fantastic. with the albatross came the wind and the mist. afterwards the sea becomes silent, the water turns to oil and the sun is bloody and vengeful. nature recognises the crime; it reacts in turn and attacks humanity in its anger. the supernatural occurs, and the power of coleridge's romantic imagination is felt. the wonder of the poem is the many allegories it holds. it can be read in many different each of which is valid. 
 the one that i hear when i read is the one that suggests of a spiritual salvation. no matter what the symbolic nature of the mariner's crime suggests, he is still redeemable. humanity is still redeemable. not all is lost. there is still hope for the spontaneous and the thoughtless: 
 ""the selfmoment i could pray; 
 and from my neck so free 
 the albatross fell off, and sank 
 like lead into the sea."" 
 it may be self-deceiving, and it may be just to save his own skin. but, i'd like to think the mariner is genuine. i'd like to think he realises the futility of his actions and comes around. i'd like think his morale transformation is real, and he isn't just doing it to continue his existence, but who knows. this poem is dense and conflicting, but it's easily coleridge's best work. in the second season of madmen, don draper, awash in the chaos of his own identity, recites these lines from ""mayakovsky,"" the last poem in this book: 
 now i am quietly waiting for 
 the catastrophe of my personality 
 to seem beautiful again, 
 and interesting, and modern. 
 frank o'hara's poetry does not have to wait--quietly or otherwise. it is always beautiful and interesting. and, sixty years later, it still seems modern too. 
 most 20th century verse lovers, if asked what midcentury poet inherited the legacy of whitman, would pick allen ginsberg, the iconic embodiment of the beats. but my vote goes to the new york school's frank o'hara. 
 ginsberg loved whitman, adopting both his long lists and his long verse lines and self-consciously donning the whitmanesque mantle of american prophet--half soapbox shouter and half hindu holyman--who celebrates the human body, alternative sexuality, and the teeming variety of the american street. but in spite of his guru-style blessings and his hipster humor, ginsberg's poems are still pervaded by an ancient--albeit syncopated--hebrew melancholy, as if the prophet jeremiah had copped a gig with a cool jazz band. 
 frank o'hara, on the other hand, writes verse suffused with optimism. he celebrates the same things ginsberg does, but unlike ginsberg--and like whitman--he immerses himself in every moment, in every detail, joyously relishing the opportunities for pure sensation and passionate friendship that new york has to offer. (i suspect that, handed a prophet's cloak, frank would have simply collapsed, helpless with laughter.) 
 o'hara, raised in massachusetts and educated as a catholic (a church he describes in one of his poems as ""at best, an over-solemn introduction to cosmic entertainment""), worked as a navy sonar technician during ww ii, went to harvard on the g.i. bill, and eventually sought his fortune in new york city. he got a job at moma--first selling postcards in the gift shop, later as a curator of painting--and threw himelf into the social whirl of the nyc art scene. 
 a devoted friend and prolific lover, he introduced poets to painters (and vice versa), reveling in personal and artistic freedom. o'hara may have died three years before the stonewall riots (a poet's death: run over by a car on fire island, where no cars are allowed), but he lived in a small, liberated enclave well ahead of its time. and his love for his world and his love for new york city shines in every line he wrote. 
 although this 1957 collection is the one most of his contemporaries knew him by, it came before his chattier, more colloquial ""personism"" period, before donald allen's revolutionary anthology the new american poets (1960) proclaimed him as a leader of the new york school, and before his small city lights book lunch poems (1964) was published, a book which contains many of his best known pieces. 
 nevertheless, this earlier volume shows o'hara to good advantage. its poems possess the characteristic o'hara virtues--the conversational tone, the manic enthusiasm, the gentle humor, the name-dropping--but, since the inspiration here is more rimbaud than mayakovsky, these poems are grandly, often bafflingly surrealist. unlike much surrealist poetry, however, these pieces show a painter's respect for form: each outrageous improvisation is placed artfully upon the canvas of the individual poem. rilke (1875-1926) was a famous german poet, born in prague. he traveled widely throughout europe, married and had a daughter. a dozen years out of school, after rilke had achieved some fame as a poet, a young man wrote to him asking for advice about life and poetry. rilke wrote ten letters to him over five years. the young boy was romantic, frail and dreamy; a prisoner, so to speak, in a military boarding school where he was subject to strict discipline, bullying and humiliation. it was the same school that rilke's father sent him to in preparation for a career as a military officer. and all those adjectives also applied to rilke who had been in the identical situation. so, in a sense, rilke poured his heart out writing to his younger self. 
 some of rilke's writings in the ten letters: 
 ""for the creative artist there is no poverty - nothing is insignificant or unimportant."" 
 ""there is nothing that manages to influence a work of art less than critical words. they always result in more or less unfortunate misunderstandings. things are not as easily understood nor as expressible as people usually would like us to believe. most happenings are beyond expression; they exist where a word has never intruded."" 
 writing in 1904 rilke was amazingly prescient about the upcoming sexual revolution: 
 ""perhaps the sexes are more closely related than one would think. perhaps the great renewal of the world will consist of this, that man and woman, freed of all confused feelings and desires, shall no longer seek each other as opposites, but simply as members of a family and neighbors, and will unite as human beings, in order to simply, earnestly, patiently, and jointly bear the heavy responsibility of sexuality that has been entrusted to them....this progress shall transform the experience of love, presently full of error, opposed at first by men, who have been overtaken in their progress by women. it shall thoroughly change the love experience to the rebuilding of a relationship meant to be between two persons, no longer just between man and woman....the men, who today cannot yet feel it coming, shall be surprised and defeated by it."" 
 ""do not allow yourself to be confused in your aloneness by the something within you that wishes to be released from it. this very wish, if you will calmly and deliberately use it as a tool, will help to expand your solitude into far distant realms."" 
 ""everything you can think about in your childhood is good."" 
 ""of all my books there are only a few that are indispensable to me. two of them are constantly at my fingertips wherever i may be. they are here with me now: the bible and the books of the great danish writer jens peter jacobsen."" (rilke particularly praises jacobsen's collection of short stories, mogens, which i have reviewed here: https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...) 
 ""we are unutterably alone, essentially, especially in the things most intimate and most important to us....it becomes increasingly clear that it [aloneness] is basically not something we can choose to have or not to have. we simply are alone. one can only delude one's self and act as though it were not so - that is all."" 
 the second half of the book is a collection of some of his poems. most are very accessible. here are some sections of verse that i liked 
 from for a friend 
 i have my dead, and i would let them go 
 and be surprised to see them all so cheerful, 
 so soon at home in being-dead, so right, 
 so unlike their repute. you, you alone, 
 return; brush past me, move about, persist 
 in knocking something that vibratingly 
 betrays you. 
 from orpheus. eurydice. hermes. 
 wrapt in herself she wandered. and her deadness 
 was filling her like fullness. 
 full as a fruit with sweetness and with darkness 
 was she with her great death, which was so new 
 that for the time she could take nothing in. 
 from the cathedral 
 in those small towns you come to realize 
 how the cathedrals utterly outgrew 
 their whole environment. their birth and rise, 
 as our own life's too great proximity 
 will mount beyond our vision and our sense 
 of other happenings, took precedence 
 of all things; as though that were history, 
 piled up in their immeasurable masses 
 in petrification safe from circumstance, 
 from the dwarf's song 
 my hands too will always be failing me. 
 how hopelessly stunted they are you can see: 
 damp, heavy, hopping constrictedly 
 like little toads in wet weather. 
 and everything else about me too 
 is old and worn and sad to view; 
 why does god delay to do 
 away with it altogether? 
 from the orphan girl's song 
 i'm no one, and no one is what i shall be. 
 i'm still too small to exist, i agree; 
 but i'll always be so. 
 ... 
 no one can need me: it's too soon now, 
 and tomorrow it's too late. 
 a very thought-provoking, calming read.

 i recently watched the masterpiece that is moonlight and to say that i was utterly blown away would not be at all an exaggeration. it's the kind of movie that sticks with you. covering issues of race, discrimination, sexuality, m/m love, coming of age, and so much more. i can't get over how wide-spanning and game-changing this film is. to quote this article, moonlight also became the first film with an all black cast, the first lgbt film and the second lowest-grossing film domestically (behind the hurt locker) to win the academy award for best picture. 
 also, that ending!!!. dev patel and andrew garfield said it best when: 
 i vividly remember thinking during one particular scene in the film, i wonder how this was written down in the script... so i was beyond ecstatic to get to read the screenplay so soon after seeing the film. and as you might've guessed, moonlight was just as spectacular on page as it was on the big screen. (plus, we get extra scenes that didn't make it into the final cute.) (and a different - but still similar - ending!!) 
 i had so many favorite scenes in moonlight - and since the film is divided into three parts, it's quite a number - so i'll just start sharing: 
 warning: i get overly excited. 
 ""juan 
 you don't talk much but you damn 
 sure can eat. 
 teresa smiling. 
 teresa 
 that's alright, baby. you talk when 
 you ready. 
 little looking up from his plate at that, something about teresa's voice, her presence, clicking with him. 
 little 
 my name chiron. 
 (and) 
 but people call me little. 
 teresa 
 i'm gon' call you by your name."" 
 this was my favorite introduction scene. made me grow appreciative of teresa and juan that more. and like the brilliant mahershala ali, who plays juan in the film, said best about his character: 
 ""juan 
 so how you like swimmin'? 
 nothing from little. heard him but the words too heavy to present themselves. 
 juan 
 that good, huh?"" 
 i cherished the above scene even more when we had it come back between little and kevin in a later part: 
 ""kevin 
 ...this dude reminded me of you. 
 beat. 
 black 
 what'd he play? 
 a long pause from kevin, the song wedging itself in his thoughts right now, pushing everything aside. 
 black 
 that good, huh?"" 
 made a megawatt smile appear on my face. 
 ""teresa 
 (playful) 
 think you slick, huh? do it wrong so teresa show up and do it right, 
 huh? 
 (laughs) 
 teresa (cont'd) 
 you and juan, thick as thieves, 
 lemme tell you. 
 teresa looking to chiron for that last part, what begins as a smile slowly fading, shifting to something more reflective, heavy. 
 teresa 
 you miss him? 
 chiron holding her gaze, his silence answer enough. 
 teresa 
 yeah. 
 me too. 
 beat. 
 teresa 
 me too."" 
 i was devastated when i found out about juan. 
 ""kevin 
 hell, shit make you wanna cry, feel 
 so good. 
 chiron looking to kevin now: 
 chiron 
 you cry? 
 kevin 
 nah. but it make me want to. 
 kevin flashing that big, cool ass smile. 
 kevin 
 what you cry about? you cry, chiron? 
 beat. 
 chiron 
 i cry so much sometimes i think one 
 day i'm gone just turn into drops."" 
 that last line impacted me so much that i wrote it down the minute i heard it in the film. 
 last but not least, i'm sharing one of the most iconic exchange between two romantically involved characters: 
 ""black 
 you're the only man who's ever 
 touched me. 
 the air going out of kevin's chest, his gaze fixated on black's lips, anticipating the words falling from there: 
 black 
 the only one. 
 black's hand is flat atop the table between them. his eyes lower to it: 
 black 
 i haven't really touched anyone, 
 since."" 
 this remains one of the most lively lines ever!!! 
 reading the screenplay set me up in this continues loop of reading and then rewatching and then rereading and watching again. help. 
 and since there are so many more scenes i want to share, i was thankful to find this post that sums them up pretty greatly: 
 real talk, moonlight has my whole heart in the palm of its fictional hands. this film deserves every award and recognition it'll receive in the near future. and i hope it collects a whole lot. 
 p.s. i love this screenplay even more for opening up my world to the fact that i can read the screenplays of my favorite films. 
 5/5 stars

 this review and more can be found on my blog. there is literally a whole monologue in which a guy complains about his dog pissing on everything. 2pac has brought me out of my reading slump. when in doubt, turn to pac. 
 most people think of him first and foremost as a rapper, but that's only one side of his story. 
 first of all, let me start off by saying that i'm not the biggest expert on rap. i do enjoy it though. if there's one thing i pride myself on, it's my constant drive to learn new things and broaden horizons. i am interested in everything. i appreciate all forms of music. rock, grunge, alternative, pop, blues, classical... most of the songs i listen to are in different languages (english, spanish, german, italian). the one genre i avoided, however, was rap. then i saw vanilla ice and was like, what have i been doing with my life. for real. straight outta croatia 
 *gets loudly booed* 
 i jest, of course. eminem is actually the one that got me into it. because... eminem. i thought i'd marry him. before that, i was convinced i'd marry nick carter. don't judge me. 
 where was i? oh... eminem. he was/is a genius. 
 but then i heard this guy. 
 2pac is the greatest. sorry em. 
 rap has been looked down on since its inception. it's not hard to see why. the lyrics are often violent and disrespectful to both the authority and the women. like many rappers, 2pac was considered a thug. indeed, he's made a lot of mistakes. i will not try to justify his behavior. i always got the sense that he was torn between his public life as a gangster rapper and his private life as a serious poet. he liked to read shakespeare and machiavelli, he took ballet classes, he appreciated pop music. and let's not forget his meaningful lyrics. 
 when i was young, me and my mama had beef 
 17 years old, kicked out on the streets 
 though back at the time i never thought i'd see her face 
 ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place 
 & 
 and since we all came from a woman 
 got our name from a woman and our game from a woman 
 i wonder why we take from our women 
 why we rape our women, do we hate our women? 
 i think it's time to kill for our women 
 time to heal our women, be real to our women 
 and if we don't we'll have a race of babies 
 that will hate the ladies that make the babies 
 and since a man can't make one 
 he has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one 
 so will the real men get up? 
 i know you're fed up, ladies, but keep your head up 
 & 
 i see no changes, all i see is racist faces 
 misplaced hate makes disgrace to races 
 we under, i wonder what it takes to make this 
 one better place, let's erase the wasted 
 take the evil out the people, they'll be acting right 
 that's some deep shi- stuff. pac was a deeply complex person. maybe i'm being overly dramatic. i love to romanticize people. i always do that. anyway, this is a great collection of poems. highly recommended for everyone. 
 p.s. if you haven't yet make sure to check out the amazing tupac: resurrection documentary. i have never loved a collection of poetry more in my entire life. here be spoilers. 
 this could all have been avoided if hamlet and his posse had sought the counsel of sassy gay friend. 
 although hamlet is one of the most important pieces of literature on the planet, many find it hard to understand. basically this is what happens. 
 hamlet is depressed and feeling emo af. he's got 99 problems and his dysfunctional family is the biggest one. the prince of denmark is not a happy camper. 
 he wants to kill his uncle aka the king to avenge his father. not a good idea. 
 i mean, i get it. claudius is a big douche. he needs to die. like a lot. but murder is murder. come on hamlet, you're better than that. 
 hamlet is starting to lose his mind. he's just walking around, saying, 'to be, or not to be: that is the question.' he has zero chill. 
 as usual gertrude and her stupidity are of no help here. 
 the person i feel most sorry for is ophelia. i like her but what was she thinking?! 
 poor ophelia. it's gotta suck when your bf tells you to go to a nunnery and you just gotta sit there and accept it. 
 i wanted to shake her and tell her to find a man who will treat her right. 
 oh hamlet you poor foolish boy. you're an idiot but you're a lovable idiot. 
 hamlet is very likely the best thing shakespeare has ever written. it's a great read, as long as you know what to expect. to borrow a quote from game of thrones- if you think this has a happy ending, you haven't been paying attention. 
 the rest is silence.

 klunm `munq lhznun hfra@an fy kynwntk,,zddt qudrtk `l~ htw farh 'kthr i was quite excited going into this because the promise of short essays, original photography and poetry combined into one sounded right up my alley. 
 you might recognise connor franta from his popular youtube channel, and in this diary-like look at his life since a work in progress, connor talks about his battles with clinical depression, social anxiety, self-love, and acceptance; his desire to maintain an authentic self in a world that values shares and likes over true connections; his struggles with love and loss; and his renewed efforts to be in the moment--with others and himself. 
 ""our words, our firsthand experiences, our shared truths can form ladders. and bring hope to others."" 
 however good the above might sound, in the end it didn't live up. and i was disappointed to find franta's writing style coming across as quite hollow and privileged. also, his weird ""i'm a special snow flake"" complex rubbed me the wrong way multiple times: 
 ""i've never been a big fan of attending awards shows. most are pretentious, and few are truly entertaining. in theory, it sounds fun to witness the glamour and chaos of the red carpet firsthand. but the truth is that once you're done up, looking fine, and immersed in such superficial gatherings . . . it's not all that. the novelty soon wears thin. 
 i don't know. maybe that's just me."" 
 i couldn't help but think of this hilarious tweet about artsy white boys(tm). 
 then the genericness of franta's thoughts and feelings didn't help his case either. there wasn't anything compelling enough for me to continue on where the writing's considered, so i did skim-read a lot towards the end. and another thing i want to point out: the atmosphere. it just felt so cold and standoffish with a lot of telling with little to no showing. i mean: ""this. fucking. sucks. i'll repeat that until you believe it: this. fucking. sucks."" 
 here's an idea: how about you show me why it fucking sucks instead of repeating it for emphasis... 
 to be frank, note to self felt a lot more fitting for the blog post format than something you'd expect to read in a book. which leads me to the pretentious tumblr-esque poems interspersed throughout: 
 there's a lot more where that came from... i'm genuinely rattled that this made it into the final version of the book. 
 however, to end this review on a much brighter note, i have to mention the vibrant photographs. not going to lie, they were the only reason i continued on with this book. but i quickly noticed that - save for a few - the pictures weren't as eye-catching as i'd hoped. (you can just go on connor franta's instagram for the same effect.) 
 but still, here are a few of my favorite photos to brighten this ending a bit:

 this review and more can be found on my blog. why is it that i love the universe of this ""dark"" comedy so much, and why does it strike me as not really being so ""dark"" after all? could it be because it is presided over by a ""god""--the young duke--who is priggish, diffident and comically vain (when his reputation is attacked by lucio), and yet is unfailingly just and honorably susceptible to the attractions of female goodness and beauty? is it because the ""villain""--angelo--is so pathetic and small that one never seriously expects he will win? or is it because this world is--in spite of all its lust and hypocrisy--an absurd, surprisingly malleable universe in which even a base rogue like barnadine can simply refuse to be executed, and then be allowed to survive? 
 all of these contribute to my great love for the play, but above all, i admire the character of isabella, who is virtuous and brave and filled with mercy even for the vile hypocrite who wronged her. she leaves me with the feeling that--grubby and fallen though it may be--this is a world worth living for. a drama written in verse about three british boys who join up the army and are sent to afghanistan that explores the aftermath of warfare and the effect on those who they left behind. the poetry part was a little hit and miss for me but most of the rhythm was really good, and the imagery was really good especially in the one verse that gave the book its name where lisa is talking about taff's time in the war. lisa had some pretty good lines in general. the subject matter felt exaggerate when reading but i kept in mind that the whole point of this is that it's supposed to be performed and i do think that it was good and it would be even better if you get to see it actually being performed, especially because hearing poetry is so different from the act of just reading it. oh, my pretty, you compelled me! 
 i had no clue poems could be so exquisite. what a reading experience! some are mystically poignant and can leave you holding tightly to something. anything. 
 they can also steal your breath away, is what i discovered. it is not that i had never read a poem in my life, but i had never found myself doing it for my own pleasure and, at the same time, realizing how they could truly affect me. 
 what i fool was i to ignore all those collections of poems i strongly heard of before! this precious book felt like a wake up call to me. lola, stories as you define them are not the only ones that a book can contain. poems, for once, are more discreet, but you have to reach out for them and then you'll see what extraordinary content they may retain. 
 some of the poems inside this are not what you would maybe qualify as 'beautiful' but perhaps more as honest. ones are also very peculiar or abstract and requiring a second, third, forth read. but would they be as interesting as they are, if everything were clear and obvious from the beginning? i loved how they made me think and left me analyzing. 
 my own favourites, between the fifty ones written, are: 
 sleeping beauty's wedding day 
 , 
 a brief history of feminism 
 , 
 vindictive punctuation 
 (what an original one!), 
 the little mermaid 
 , 
 nature lesson 
 and 
 view from the balcony 
 . 
 what i did find lacking though is the 'fairytale' atmosphere. i caught it in multiple poems but many don't possess it and that is unfortunate because it cold have embellished them even more! especially the 'contemporary' ones. 
 i had read works including feminism as theme before, but never as present and subjected to obvious opinions as it was in this. although, that is such an important belief and movement in support of women's rights and equality, to me, so i will look forward to reading more of it. 
 unsurprisingly, i am more than recommending this read! even if, as i was, you may not be sure that you might enjoy it. it could be that you find yourself suddenly gasping for more, in the end, as i felt. perhaps that will not happen, but i still think it is worth trying. and, finally, if you have recommendations for me, please feel free to share them in the comments. happy reading! you cannot prevent the birds of sorrow from flying over your head, but you can prevent them from building a nest in your hair 
 - chinese proverb 
 i picked this up because the title struck me like a poem in itself, sounding like an titillating modulation on that wonderful poem hope is the thing with feathers by emily dickinson i am intrigued by the technique of altering variations on a theme, like in music, and keen on searching for changes in harmony, rhythm, melody, or orchestration . a glance on the explicit cover art however leaves no room for dulcet misunderstanding: the 'thing with feathers' isn't a tender still-downy birdie, but a lugubrious black bird - it is ted hughes's sinister crow, resuscitated in this fable-like tale about coping with the sudden death of a spouse and mother. 
 do we find books or do books find us? having experienced the death of a spouse twice - a brutal, sudden one and one following a long illness, going through a childless mourning and one together with two children now, this novella focussing on the grieving process of a father and his 2 young sons came to find me. strange enough, both times ted hughes (1930-1998) crossed my path, the first time with birthday letters , published a few months after my first spouse's death, and now again with max porter's novella, exuding ted hughes from every pore. 
 while the father tries to continue working after the death of his wife, writing a book about ted hughes 's crow, 'crow on the couch, a wild analysis', crow enters, promising (or threatening?) to stay as long as the father and the 2 young boys need him. the crow character, associated with numerous myths about death and dying, like the raven symbolizing death itself in some cultures, curiously brings life instead of death, epitomizing grief and sadness as an incontrovertible part of life. he claims to be a sentimental bird, thriving on sorrow, eating it. as grief is raw, dirty, scary and exhausting - certainly rather a crow than a sweet little bird of hope - the image of the omnipresent crow embodying grief is excellent and powerful, but it is hughes's creature after all, not porter's. to determine whether both crowish characters are idiosyncratic or not, the original crow poetry should be read, which i didn't. porter's winged friend rings true to its archetypical crowish nature: vibrant, intelligent, playful, a mythical trickster. 
 porter in general escapes wallowing in sentimentality, showing the raw and messy face of grief, observing astutely the pulverised lives of a family in mourning, a family who does not simply 'move on' but anyway has no choice then to live on, floundering through life's trivialities of eating, cleaning, banking, working. inevitably, depending on one's own life experiences with loss and its connected sensibilities, the reader can expect some fragments to tear on a reader's heartstrings when facing the physical and emotional void left by the beloved: 
 she won't ever use (make-up, turmeric, hairbrush, thesaurus). she won't ever finish (patricia highsmith novel, peanut butter, lip balm). 
 there were flashes of insight and recognition. the silent witnesses of what once was a life, flying shrapnels in the house. the piercing pain a little note can provoke. the gentle instigation of good friends to pick up life again. the sudden single-parenting issues. ""moving on, as a concept, is for stupid people, because any sensible person knows grief is a long-term project. i refuse to rush. the pain that is thrust upon us let no man slow or speed or fix."" true. but also a truism. 
 porter piqued my curiosity about hughes's original crow poetry, and about some of the other british poets featuring in his debut novel probably worth exploring. his own creation fell flat in getting me into the hearts and minds of the grieving family, apart from a few moving passages, like the moment the father frees her ashes: 
 up they went, the sense of a cloud, the failure of clouds, scientifically quick and visually hopeless, a murder of little burnt birds flecked against the grey sky, the grey sea, the white sun, and gone. 
 alternatingly listening to the voices of the father, the boys and crow, the irking voice of crow irritated me at first. having read the novella a second time now, the wordplay and onomatopoeia keep striking me as rather childish and hollow - dissonant cawing, futile twaddle. in the dutch translation i read, the ostensible poetry in his lines resembles what we call in dutch 'karamellenverzen'(toffee verses). namedropping poets or writing about poetry does not turn a tale into a prose poem in itself. 
 perhaps aspiring to depict how grief loses its bleak sharpness through the passing of time, making place for a milder cherishing of precious memories without ever entirely vanishing or healing, porter's fable premise and magic realism might not fully convey authenticity, but should be honoured as an honest attempt to word the ineffable. 
 on a si peur des souvenirs 
 les oublier c'est un peu mourir. 
 (jo lemaire, la memoire en exil) it's impossible not to smile when you start reading such a classic and, after only the first few pages, you realize and completely understand why it's regarded as one of the most important works in literature. i'm always a little anxious when i tackle such important and renowned books for being afraid of not comprehending or loving them - war and peace and don quixote, for example - as they seem to deserve. not that i'm obligated to like them, but i always feel such buzz comes for a reason and i try to at least find out why. with the odyssey, once again, i find that the ones who have read it before me were right: it's amazing. 
 i didn't have plans to read the odyssey any time soon - i've never devoted much time to epic poems and this one has more than 12,000 verses -, but because i've been eying ulysses on my shelves for quite some time, i decided to prepare myself for it and read about odysseus with a great group here on goodreads. to call homer's book simply ""a preparation"" for joyce's work is now not only unfair, but also absurd to me. however, i'm glad that i finally read it, whatever the reason behind it was. 
 the odyssey tells the story of odysseus's (ulysses) journey back to his home ithaca to return to his wife penelope and son telemachus after twenty years of absence. our hero left his home to fight in the trojan war - that alone lasted ten years - and encountered too many obstacles that kept him away for another ten years. back in ithaca, people had already lost hope that he could still be alive and his wife was being courted by suitors who wanted to marry her. 
 alongside the emotional and heartfelt story, what grabbed my attention here was the poem's style and structure. for a work that's believed to have been written in the 8th century bc, its quality and refinement certainly amazed me. some of the story is told through flashbacks, some of it is told through different narrators and its narratives are non-linear, so i was positively surprised. 
 i could try to write an analysis about the recurring themes on the book - vengeance, spiritual growth, hospitality - or try to decipher its symbolism - much has been written about odysseus's bow, laertes's shroud, the sea -, but i feel i would fail and wouldn't be able to do it in a deep level, especially after having read the great introduction and notes written by bernard knox. 
 what kept me away from homer's work was the fear that it would be too dense and heavy on mythology - it is mythological, of course -, making it hard for me to understand it. although labored, the narrative is quite simple and easy to follow. knox's notes were a great companion to fill in the details i needed to comprehend the book in a deeper level. 
 rating: it's my belief that a great book not only satisfy your expectations, but also inspire you to delve further into its writer's other works, similar subjects or even other books from the same time period. the odyssey raised my interest about greek mythology and the iliad, so i guess it served its purpose with high colors. because of that, 5 glowing and beautiful stars. bysw hw dhlk ldhy j ly`br `ny 'khyr

 'n dgty rtf` wjly lskr ever since i first read homer's epic describing the adventures of odysseus back in my school days, three of those adventures fired my imagination: the lotus eaters, the cyclops and the sirens, most especially the sirens. i just did revisit these sections of this greek epic and my imagination was set aflame yet again. how much, you ask? here is my microfiction as a tribute to the great poet: 
 the sirens 
 this happened back in those days when i was a member of an experimental performing-arts troupe down in greenwich village. we would read poetry, dance and act out avant-garde plays in our dilapidated little theater. for a modest charge people could come in and watch for as long as they wanted. 
 somehow, a business executive who worked downtown in the financial district heard of what we were doing and spoke with our director about an act he has all worked out but needed a supporting cast and that he would pay handsomely if we went along with him. 
 well, experimental is experimental and if we were going to be well paid we had nothing to lose. the first thing he did was pass out our costumes. in addition to himself, he had parts for three men and three women. the play we were to perform was so simple we didn't even need a written script. he was to be odysseus from homer's epic and three men would be his sailors. as for the women, we would be the singing sirens. 
 so, after he changed - quite a sight in a loincloth, being gray-haired, jowly, pasty-skinned and potbellied - we went on stage and he told the sailors how no man has ever heard the hypnotic songs of the sirens and lived to tell the tale but he, mighty odysseus, would be the first. he instructed the sailors to tie him to the ship's mast. they used one of the building's pillars and when he cried out as the sirens sang their song the sailors, who had wax in their ears, were to bind him to the mast even tighter. 
 meanwhile, three of us ladies were on stage as the sirens, in costume, bare-breasted and outfitted with wings. we began singing a sweet, lilting melody. mike - that was the businessman's name - started screaming and the sailors tightened the ropes that bound him. the sailors were glad their ears were plugged as mike screamed for nearly half an hour. 
 when the ship passed out of earshot of the sirens, the sailors unbound mighty odysseus and he collapsed on our makeshift stage, a mass of exhausted middle-aged flesh. the audience applauded, even cheered and we continued our performance of odysseus and the sirens every night for more than a week. then one night mike outdid himself. his blue eyes bulged, the veins in his neck popped and his face turned a deeper blood-scarlet than ever before. and what i feared might happen, did happen - mike had a heart attack. we had to interrupt our performance and call an ambulance. 
 we all thought that was the end of our dealing with mike aka odysseus until our director received a call from the hospital. mike told her he was going to be just fine and would be back on stage next week. we called a meeting and everyone agreed that we would suggest mike seek psychiatric help but if he insists on playing odysseus, he will have to take his act elsewhere.

 i am amazed at how in just a few short words, nayyirah can invoke so much emotion. 
 i will definitely be reading this again many many times. 
 i am going to insert a few of my favorite poems, but seriously every single one is a gem. 
 i am the line. 
 on both sides there are songs 
 in my name 
 -bi 
 i am a black wave 
 in 
 a white sea. 
 always seen 
 and 
 unseen. 
 -the difference 
 for me 
 there is no other. 
 because there is no default. 
 everyone

 -the human being | the human gender | the human sex when confronted with the painful choice of whether or not to read chaucer in the original middle english, i agonised for precisely four seconds and decided to read nevill coghill's modern translation in lovely penguin paperback. in the same way i wouldn't learn german to read goethe, or unlearn english to read dan brown, i refuse to learn archaic forms of english for pointless swotty scholar-points, and grope instead for selfish readerly pleasure, two-fingering the purists and bunking down with mr. nevill for nights of sumptuous moral homily, proto-feminist romantic comedy, and high courtly drama. for chaucer neophytes like me, this text captures the bouncy humour and devilish cleverness of the original (not that i would know!), and hopefully will turn a generation of frightened and unenlightened readers on to this master of verse. (and if you must know, my rhyming homage review was lost due to a power failure and a more tempting invitation to eat pilaf rice with brian. street children! wives of bath! go forth and chaucerize!) after ana commits suicide, audery can't stop having panic attacks. audery has a secret and the guilt is killing her, knowing that a lie she told ended in ana's death. at ana's funeral audery meets her boyfriend rad and the two leave the funeral to go somewhere and talk. audrey can't help but be attracted to rad and can't stop thinking about him even though she has her own boyfriend. the two eventually lose touch only end up running into one another again years down the line. audery and rad keep being drawn together but audery doesn't know how she can be with rad after what the did to ana. 
 the writing was okay but i didn't really enjoy the plot here. i thought the ending was kind of strange and how did they not do an autopsy of ana i thought they did even with suicides especially with the rumors going around about her and her dad . i just couldn't get into the book, i thought it was going to be like teenage angst but it wasn't really. i didn't feel bad for audrey either like who lies about that i don't care how old you are. also when audrey leaves to rediscover herself i was so bored. i don't think it was necessary to add that in to the plot. it didn't really do anything for her growth, she just had another relationship. it made the book feel longer than necessary. to see this review and others please visit www.readrantrockandroll.com

 i decided to try note to self by connor franta because i had a free audible credit and it sounded like something i would enjoy. i appreciate learning about other people and the struggles they've had in life and how they've endured them. 
 i went into this book fairly blind and didn't even know who connor franta was. my oldest son, who's a youtuber did, and i can see this book being helpful to older teens and younger adults. it's so raw and insightful-i think it would've been helpful to have this book when i was in high school. there are so many emotions that we go through at this age and into young adulthood. connor lays out his emotions and exposes his experiences in a way that helps you to understand that you're not alone in your thoughts. at times it felt like he was pulling some of his thoughts right out of my own head. how should we be thinking and how can we deal with these emotions in a non- damaging way to ourselves and others? hmm, that may take me some more time to figure out... 
 connor discusses some of the problems he's had including struggling with his sexuality, depression, social anxiety, loss of relationships and issues he's had with feeling accepted. when listening to him talk about his struggle with depression, i admire the way he describes his depression as being another person and to be sure to never believe the horrible thoughts that run through your mind. be sure to wipe them away- i loved this because it's so true. it's something i feel anyone who struggles with depression and anxiety can benefit from-realizing that the emotions and feelings are part of you, but don't define you. 
 i also enjoyed the part where he discusses how we feel about ourselves. if you think you're confident you will be - self perception. how many times have you felt unconfident? i've had this happen numerous times in my life. 
 i did listen to this on audible and was thrilled that the audio-book is read by the author. i'm afraid i may have missed some visual content, but i do know that there are many positive statements in this book that can benefit those who struggle in life and for those figuring everything out. i feel that it can help instill bravery. in some ways the writing did feel like it could have been better and maybe didn't feel compelling enough, but i still enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone, especially older teens who are moving towards adulthood.

 shakespeare's sonnet xciv (abridged) 
 stay cool man. peace. 
 like, flower power, y'know? can you write a book review 
 entirely in verse? 
 omitting standard sentences 
 for stanzas taut and terse? 
 it seems a fitting treatment 
 for such a book as this; 
 so humor me, i beg you-- 
 and my limited wit. 
 emily dickinson was a poet, 
 one of the very best; 
 a natural gift with language-- 
 at once daft and deft. 
 something of a recluse, 
 something of a crank; 
 living closed up in her room-- 
 like a fish in a tank. 
 undoubtedly a genius, 
 ahead of her time; 
 unappreciated in her life, 
 for her erratic rhymes. 
 but when she finally passed away, 
 her cache of poems was found; 
 edited to the day's tastes-- 
 the dashes taken out. 
 the dash--the perfect punctuation 
 for her unique style; 
 jagged--ragged--sudden--striking 
 and also--versatile. 
 obsessed with life--and death--and bees, 
 most of her poems are short; 
 some of them only one quatrain, 
 they end before they start. 
 and what entrancing rhythm! 
 like the beating of a drum-- 
 her words hammer forward-- 
 marching--stomping--thumping--done! 
 the classic case of genius, 
 at first misunderstood; 
 now her poems are classic, 
 widely read and widely loved. 
 so thank you, ms. dickinson, 
 for dedicating yourself-- 
 to art, to words, to poetry-- 
 to posterity's bookshelf. ""in many ways, a book is, in itself, a tiny universe. each page is like a newly formed galaxy, fashioned from a single, pulsing thought. 
 a book travels for days, for years, sometimes for centuries to meet you at an exact point in time."" 
 the above quote perfect describes my feelings about this book. 
 this was my first lang leav poetry book, and i was truly not expecting to like this collection so much - mainly because i don't consider myself to be much of a romantic - but the universe of us really surprised me for the better. (and also that cover is absolutely stunning.) 
 this book covers everything from love and loss, hope and hurt, being lost and found. and i was actually let down when i reached the ending so quickly. i'll definitely be picking up more of lang leav's books very soon. 
 but for now, i'll share a few quotes from my favorite poems in this collection: 
 i am 
 ""and i told him, if i am so hard to love, then let me run wild. 
 my love is not a testament to my surrender. i will show you just how much i love you, with the inward draw of every breath--the collective sigh of the world and all its despair. but i will never give you what you want in chains."" 
 today 
 ""my demons are lying in wait, they are grinning in the shadows, their polished fangs glinting, knowing today, it will be an easy kill. but tomorrow, tomorrow could be different, and that is what keeps me going today."" 
 the butterfly effect 
 ""i know you are scared. who could blame you? love is a hurricane wrapped inside a chrysalis. and you are a girl walking into the storm."" 
 moment of truth 
 ""the second i tried to tell myself i wasn't in love was the moment i realized i was."" 
 conversations 
 ""most people want to save the entire world. it's a lovely thought, and i'm not saying it's not a noble pursuit--but it's impossible to save everyone. you just have to pick your little corner of the world and focus your energy there. that's the only way you will ever make a difference."" 
 a lesson 
 ""there is a girl who smiles all the time, 
 to show the world that she is fine. 
 a boy who surrounds himself with friends, 
 wished that his life would end. 
 for those that say they never knew-- 
 the saddest leave the least of clues."" 
 possibility of love 
 ""yes, i think it is entirely possible to fall in love with someone you've never met. physicality is an expression of intimacy--not an indication of it."" 
 her time 
 ""she can feel it down to her very core--this is her time. she will not only climb mountains--she will move them too."" 
 the one 
 ""i don't want to be the one who tucks you into bed--i want to be the reason why you can't sleep at night."" 
 a whole universe 
 ""when you lose a person, a whole universe goes along with them."" 
 gone 
 ""the sad thing is,"" she said, ""the moment you start to miss someone, it means they're already gone."" 
 once 
 ""i loved you once and now i must spend my whole life explaining why."" 
 salve 
 ""you won't hear from me again after today, and i don't want you to worry. i'll be okay. because i have to be."" 
 a premonition 
 ""but when i look at you, i just know instinctively, that despite the odds against you and although life will always find a way to test you, someday you'll have everything you want. your ending will be a happy one."" 
 loving you 
 ""loving you is like being ten years old again, scaling a tree with my eyes bright and skyward, wanting only to get higher and higher, without a thought of how i would get back down."" 
 quiet 
 ""i've grown quiet now. you won't hear me talk about you anymore. it doesn't hurt like it used to. i suppose that is something to be thankful for."" 
 your words 
 ""remember, your words are your power. never forget your words."" 
 i'm so glad to having finally read some of lang leav's writing. i hope it will only go up from here. 
 i also found that listening to this song really amped-up my reading experience:

 this review and more can be found on my blog. what do you say to someone who tells you to stop being yourself? you love him and you want to marry him, and he comes out with that. he tells you to stop writing poetry; it's something women can't do well apparently, and he tells you to give it up. essentially, he tells you to stop being you. here is romney's ignorant argument to his aurora: 
 ""we get no christ from you- and verily 
 we shall not get a poet in my mind."" 
 aurora does the right thing, she says the right things, and she walks away. she doesn't sacrifice herself, her individuality, to become some foolish man's helpmate: his restricted victorian wife. she remains aurora. 
 she was raised to believe in respectability and womanhood. her aunt made her read guides on manners and appropriate behaviours a woman should manifest. aurora didn't have the time for such crap. she wasn't going to become a caged bird or someone's doll. she liberated her own mind through books on history, politics and art. it is only when aurora discovers her father's library, with its extensive range of ideas and knowledge that she feels her world and mind opening up. books liberate her. 
 she became intelligent enough to understand that she shouldn't be led by anyone else whether male or female. she became her own person in body and soul. and this hugely creative narrative poem depicts her journey through life as she comes to understand the true meaning of love. her autonomy drives the poem forward; she wishes to be able to express her own thoughts and emotions in her art form. similar to jane's voice in jane eyre, aurora's poetry becomes a means of liberating herself and expressing her emotions and desires. 
 eventually, her foolish lover realises the errors of his ways. he reads some of aurora's poetry, and says: 
 you have the stars, 'he murmured- 'it is well: 
 be like them! shine, aurora, on my dark 
 thus everything ends in happiness, but not after barret browning has made her stance very clear on the victorian woman question. healthy marriage is perfectly achievable if it occurs through mutual respect and autonomy. one partner should not dominate the other's personality and individualism. the wife is not a simple creature to be shaped in accordance with her husband's will: she is not his helpmate. she is an individual and this should be retained for a healthy marriage. it seems like an obvious statement, but the victorians were idiots when it came to marriage. 
 she comes to regret her earlier refusal of romney; however, it can be argued that their initial marriage would have been a failure because aurora would not have had her art. aurora not becoming a possession of romney is browning's answer to the woman question and a love filled marriage. later, after there is an acceptance of the place of each in a relationship, romney recognises aurora's art and individualism, a healthy marriage is possible. this marriage, this love, becomes an artistic muse for aurora, oneness with god is achieved. 
 this poem is very rich in sentimentality and instructive purpose. oscar wilde would have hated it. but that's beside the point. there is a strong message in here, and despite its overt nature, it is an important one. also of note, this can easily be read alongside the fantastic jane eyre. there are many crossovers in theme and message. i'd recommend it to lovers of charlotte bronte's masterpiece. 
 >postscript- this is the longest poem i've ever read. at 300+ pages, i can easily say it was as enjoyable as any novel. and this quote was my favourite. can you tell why? 
 ""books, books, books! 
 i had found the secret of a garret room 
 piled high with cases in my father's name; 
 piled high, packed large,--where, creeping in and out 
 among the giant fossils of my past, 
 like some small nimble mouse between the ribs 
 of a mastodon, i nibbled here and there 
 at this or that box, pulling through the gap, 
 in heats of terror, haste, victorious joy, 
 the first book first. and how i felt it beat 
 under my pillow, in the morning's dark, 
 an hour before the sun would let me read! 
 my books!"" lang leav may become the first author to whom i don't give three chances to impress me. even though this book is free on netgalley, my past experiences with her have been so horrifying that i can't imagine this one will be so much improved that it will catapult her into ""tolerable"" territory. especially since, after making up her own rules as far as what ""poetry"" is for the past few books, with this one we are told she ""evokes universal feelings with her skillfully crafted words."" 
 so now she's making up her own words? crafting them like an artisan? a lang leav lexicon is the last thing this world needs. 
 so, yeah - two strikes and then the game was called for inclement weather. and then the field burned down and was repopulated by rabid wombats. and no one ever went near there again. ps- follow our publishing journey on facebook! www.facebook.com/headlinersbmp 
 guys! this is the book i've been helping to publish and look at the cover 
 look 
 at 
 it 
 i designed this cover and it is my baby. 
 now i'm pretty biased rating this 5/5 stars but it really is a cool collection you guys should check out! emily dickinson is one of my favourite poets; she is the gothic queen of poetry. at times she strongly reminds me of edgar allan poe. her poems are less macabre than poe's and certainly less fantastical, focusing more on human perception of the darkness and the realities of life, but her work is undoubtedly on par with his in the vein of dark romanticism. 
 there's just something exceedingly morose about the way in which she writes. she was terribly depressed for much of her life, and such a pessimistic attitude to life can be seen within her writing. these are the words of a woman completely disillusion with the human experience; there is little light in these poems. humans are portrayed as weak and self-destructive; they are at times evil and even hellish in nature. all depictions are typically one sided with the darkness conquering any sense of hope. if anything hope is dead within her words. there is only one thing we are striving for in life, and that's the end according to such thinking. 
 death 
 read enough of dickinson's poetry and you will see how obsessed with death she is; it a recurring theme across her work, one she brings up time and time again. she spent most of her life in solitude so it's no surprise that she came up with poetry so dark in content; she had a miserable life, and it reflects in the nature of her writing: 
 ""because i could not stop for death - 
 he kindly stopped for me - 
 the carriage held but just ourselves - 
 and immortality."" 
 the words feel calm and almost serene, as the speaker is accepting of her mortality. she establishes the idea that death is not a choice; it just happens like life just happens. so we should just sit back and enjoy the ride, as she does in death's carriage. it passes through the surrounding scenery at a slow pace and observes children playing near wide open fields. this is indicative of the fact that death will come for everyone: there's no escaping it. the speaker is only half dressed, which suggest that nobody is truly ever ready for death; it comes when it will come never mind how unprepared you are. death waits for no man. 
 death is personified as a gentleman here, one who will escort her to the afterlife. death, to dickinson, is not the end; it is the road to immortality: the beginning. indeed, at the end of the poem she reveals she has actually been dead for centuries (shock-horror!) we're left with the lingering image of dead horses perpetually pushing her forward into eternity. it's a wonderful poem, dark and gripping, ethereal and enchanting. of all of dickinson's poetry, this is the one that sticks with me. years after i first read it, i still hear the opening lines. 
 she also characterises god as a reckless and almost careless deity. he is not the ideal that many perceive him to be. at the moment of death he fumbles at your soul; you are not elevated or taken to heaven, but ""stunned"" and ""scalped"" in the process, then struck like a ""thunderbolt."" god has paws which make him sound animalistic and beastlike; he is not kind and forgiving. death is not the end, but it doesn't have to be a glamourous experience. indeed, in another poem the speaker is transfixed by the buzzing of a fly as she lies on her death bed. it's the last thing she hears; it's her last experience on earth. in this, it abandons all glorified religious imagery, and almost portrays an ironically realistic moment. she further hints that faith only works for those that are truly devout. if you don't really believe in it, then calling upon god's name is pointless. she suggests that those people should look to science for the answers rather than a false bastion they don't really believe in. 
 dickinson is my idea of the perfect poet. she is a religious sceptic, but she is not dismissive of a possible truth in religion. her poetry dances between opposing ideas and it doesn't suggest truth in either of them; thus, it is open to interpretation and debate. it can be read in different ways and through this it is profound, powerful and utterly beautiful. i love her unique style, though she's not one that's going to leave you feeling uplifted after reading her work that's for sure. this was such an empowering collection of poems. it was brutal, honest and deeply personal. *disclaimer- as always, any comments concerning politics will get the rough treatment. that is delete and block.* 
 ""if hieronymus bosch had gotten around to writing poems, i suspect they would have sounded like novica tadia++ ."" 
 charles simic 
 i feel this quote describes the nature of the poems included in this superb collection in a way more accurate than any review. this is my first foray into the work of novica tadia++ and the only word i can use to describe the experience is ""shuttering"". 
 tadia++ is considered to be the finest poet in serbia and among the most significant literary figures of balkan literature. born in picturesque montenegro, he spent his life in beautiful belgrade and his poems seem to reflect the idea of the metropolis and its influence in our lives. the isolation that often comes with living in a big city, the turbulent past of a country in a region that has suffered tremendously, paying a terrible price in blood and pain, the search for a kind of innocence and the danger of losing hope are the main themes in this collection. 
 the scenery is modern, urban but hellish. this is a city where demons are ready to attack. there are dark corners occupied by people without property, without future or hope. they are sitting, watching the passerby. images of flames, destroyed buildings, houses blackened with smoke standing amidst a heavy darkness, bring to mind pictures and memories of wars we all try to forget in a not so distant past. darkness and claustrophobia are always present. there are elements of well-known balkan folk legends and references to biblical stories. 
 unfortunately, i am not able to read the poems in serbian (yet) and i am certain that much is lost in translation. still, this collection is so powerful, dark, haunting, nightmarish. unlike anything i've ever read in terms of poetry. what shocked me most is tadia++'s descriptions of the violence coming from the mob, the sadistic tendency to continue beating sometime who has reached the lowest point that seems to be planted in every human being, looking for the chance to come to surface. as i was reading, the busy metropolis came alive in my mind. nightly streets, still wet with rain. dimmed lights in the distance, footsteps walking noisily in a hurry, lonely people smoking in a corner. reflections of troubled faces on the glass. reflections on the waters of the sava and the danube. 
 there were five poems that i couldn't stop thinking about: 
 midnight lady 
 ""...dumbstruck night creatures 
 will now see the face of death, 
 the zero, the shrew, the abyss..."" 
 dark things 
 ""...night is their kingdom, 
 and this day, just breaking, 
 is their cloak of light."" 
 armful of twigs, dream 
 ""...flames rise and the glow 
 beyond the ecstatic crowd 
 singing, shouting and firing guns."" 
 city at night 
 ""...in this city with its dimmed lights 
 where there appears to be no one, 
 did you see the wreckers, 
 wrecking buildings, wrecking bridges, 
 filling up the river with rubble?"" 
 the poem titled amidst the noise is shuttering. a guernica in poetic form... 
 i don't have anything more to say, except that you owe it to yourselves to read this collection. sometimes, nightmares can be of a special kind, of striking beauty. i plan to visit the white city again this winter and i know these poems will not leave my mind easily... 
 1. 
 poor us, we are all kings 
 when we gaze at the starry sky. 
 2. 
 the noise of the crowd grows faint 
 on the town square and in our blood. 
 3. 
 the voice will re-enter the angelaeur(tm)s trumpet. 
 once again hell will rise on its feet

 wmshy this long-awaited second collection of poetry by rupi kaur made waves; it was a ride brimming with of every kind of emotion imaginable. divided into five chapters and illustrated by kaur, the sun and her flowers is a vibrant and transcendent journey about growth and healing. ancestry and honoring one's roots. expatriation and rising up to find a home within yourself. 
 kaur's voice is as audacious and brave as ever. she nails to perfection the specific intimate details that made her writing so achingly real in milk and honey. we have poems exploring self-love, self-hate, body-image, girls supporting girls, motherly love, feminism, insecurity, sexual assault, and so much more. i read through it in a whirlwind. i barely put it down, and it was so short i didn't even have to. 
 the author's smart, poised, and down-to-earth writing oozes inspiration. and i'm beyond eager to share some of my favorite pieces: 
 i'll never grow tired of reading kaur's passionate words. and i hope there's more and more to await in the future, regarding her poetry.

 this review and more can be found on my blog. it wasn't a book that i really enjoyed much. 
 new material by tolkien! 
 i was really eager to read it since i found so awesome the idea of reading a ""new"" book by jrr tolkien. 
 something that i'd never think that it could be possible. 
 of course, i know that it was thanks to the editing of his son, christopher tolkien. 
 but still, it was a ""new"" book by tolkien. 
 a sword hard to take out from stone 
 i found interesting some information of the legend of king arthur in the further notes by tolkien's son, however the verses themselves by jrr tolkien were written in an english so old that i hardly could make some sense out of was happening in the narrative. in all cases, they were the afternotes by tolkien's son were i understood what supposed to happening on the verses. 
 also, a key factor of reading this book was the mention that there was a connection between the events here and the epic saga of the lord of the rings. 
 however, i was expecting something more insightful about the connection of arthur's legend and the middle-earth's stories, but the connection mentioned here was something that i already figured it out before and i heard it in some other tv documentary about it. 
 nevertheless, it's great to add of some tolkien's work in my list of already read books. these are 
 just simple 
 sentences 
 broken up 
 with spaces. 
 seriously, some of them i was like, i love this! but i didn't view them as poems. they're more like simple quotes. but i get that this is a kind of poetry and people love it, but to me it's just not anything special. hl st'khdhk mny ???!

 >shhrzd lkhlyj < nki bhq ry'`h oh odysseus, how i love thee.. but, bro, you need to get a grip. here's an experiment i'd like a teacher to try for me. don't ""teach"" this newbery award winner. instead, place a copy of crossover on each student's desk before they enter the classroom. maybe upside down and backward to make it a bit more tempting. and then wait to see what happens. 
 if the students say, ""do we have to read this?"" answer, ""i was curious whether anyone would want to."" if they say, ""what are we going to do with this book?"" answer, ""i thought i'd ask you that question."" if they ask, ""is there going to be a test?"" answer, ""do you think there should be?"" if they ask, ""what's it about?"" answer, ""just about anything you want it to be about."" and then wait to see what happens. 
 maybe you could do a bit of action research. count how many open it up, how many start acting up, how many keep chatting until they notice someone who doesn't usually read is getting caught up in its pages. take notes on comments. you see, the book starts out,

 straignt in the hole: 
 swoooooooooosh. 
 but each chapter uses a different style of poetry (oh please don't have the kids analyze it all!). there's cool white space for taking notes (it'd be so cool to give each class a different ink color and let them make notes in to to the others using the same copy but don't require it). there's themes of friendship and family and courage and sportsmanship and academics and fairness and more (but don't make them write a five-paragraph essay) it isn't just a basketball book. it's got something for everyone. try it. and let me know what happens. have your ever met a person who does something that should be annoying, but for some reason, when this particular person does it, you don't find it annoying at all? i thought about this recently when i read the 77 dream songs, and began to think about john berryman and robert lowell. 
 interested in the origins of confessional poetry, i decided to read life studies (1959), by robert lowell, grand-daddy of confessional poets, teacher of sexton and plath. but i hated it. every other line harbored some obscure biographical reference or arcane allusion. worse, the argument of each poem was so elliptical that context gave me little clue. i couldn't force my way through it. i gave up. 
 still interested in confessional poetry, i resolved to read 77 dream songs, a work of confessional poetry that john berryman, lowell's contemporary, published five years after life studies. almost immediately, from the first dream song, i was immersed in magnificent language, aware that berryman was speaking about cataclysmic loss: 
 all the world like a woolen lover 
 once did seem on henry's side. 
 then came a departure. 
 thereafter nothing fell out as it might or ought. 
 i don't see how henry, pried 
 open for all the world to see, survived. 
 i liked the third dream song too, the way it relegated rilke to the rim of dantes' hell, rilke the transcendent poet who was also an unscrupulous manipulator of women, particularly his aristocratic, neurasthenic patrons: 
 rilke was a jerk. 
 i admit his griefs & music 
 & titled spelled all-disappointed ladies. 
 a threshold worse than the circles 
 where the vile settle and lurk, 
 rilke's . . . 
 and then i was completely won over by this description in ""dream song 4"" of a woman at a dinner party whom the speaker is eyeing lustfully: 
 filling her compact & delicious body 
 with chicken paprika, she glanced at me 
 twice. 
 fainting with interest, i hungered back 
 and only the fact of her husband and four other people 
 kept me from springing on her 
 or falling at her little feet and crying 
 'you are the hottest one for years of night 
 henry's dazed eyes 
 have enjoyed, brilliance.' i advanced upon 
 (despairing) my spumoni. 
 i was hooked. there were greater delights to come--including the much anthologized dream song 14--but i knew then and there i wanted to read this book to the end. i did so, and would recommend it as one of the great poetic achievements of the 20th century and one of my favorite poetry collections too. 
 here comes the funny part. 77 dreams songs is allusive and obscure, perhaps worse than lowell's life studies. a dozen dream songs still baffle me, and there are at least a dozen more i only incompletely understand. besides, the three shifting voices--henry, mr. bones, and the ""author"" --drive me crazy. where does one leave off and another begin? who is saying what to whom? 
 all this should be annoying, and yet somehow it isn't. the music of the verse makes up for everything. the heart's cry singing in every line wins my respect and love. 
 you remember the person i talked about before, the person you meet with the annoying habit who turns out not to be annoying at all? poets can be like that too. and in my experience, whenever you meet someone like that--either a person or poet--it could be the sign of a friendship that is to come. i found a beautiful 40th anniversary edition of this at costco and just had to pick it up! such a great book throwback to childhood waddup this is another one of those times when my star ratings only make sense to me, and no one should dismiss this book because i ""only"" gave it three stars, since some people seem to think three stars is a bad thing. 
 which it is not. 
 however, this is my second sam pink book, and i liked it slightly less than i am going to clone myself then kill the clone and eat it, which i gave four stars. so blah-di-bloo... 
 if you read my review of the first book of his i read, just insert ""ditto"" here. it is more of the same kind of sad and true and damaged reflections from a sad and true and damaged individual that manages to be horrifying and funny and occasionally sweet, but which is also so many times saying what i am thinking that it is sobering and scary. 
 but it's better to just let his words speak for themselves: 
 ---i've seen a crowd of people in my head and the whole crowd points at me, saying, ""ewwww"" and is then quiet. 
 and the quiet is always worse that the ""ew."" 
 ---right now, there's at least one other person thinking about cutting someone they know in half, like a magician using a saw - only without any illusion - without any saw - and this person is someone the magician knows - and this person has taught the magician the trick. 
 ---sometimes things are done when you say they're done - and sometimes before you even notice. 
 ---i'd love to cut your face open with the smaller blade on a swiss army knife. 
 but who wouldn't! 
 ---this is good 
 this is so good i am so happy right now. 
 this is my maniac youth. 
 and the maniac youth will never be over. 
 because it is always just beginning. 
 27 years old and responsible enough to think being born is always an accident. 
 fuck this. 
 give me thirty minutes and i'll feel completely different. 
 ---""you never smile."" 
 ""i've never seen you smile."" 
 ""how come you don't smile."" 
 ""why don't you ever smile."" 
 ""why are you smiling like that?"" 
 ---my first reaction to not hearing from someone in a while is that s/he has discovered a good reason not to like me - a reason i'd immediately agree with if told. 
 and check this shit out - my main reason for not communicating is not wanting to bother someone. 
 cool, dude! 
 slamdunk, dude! 
 ---i avoid things that will make me happy, because those things are the hardest to think about later. 
 later is the worst. 
 it's time to hurt a thing that can't defend itself. 
 it's time to see the immense clear tendon that runs through all occurring things. 
 it's time to feel the worst. 
 ---when i was five, me and another kid who was five would show each other our dicks on the school bus home every day. not sure why it happened more than once. who knows! 
 ---because it's a bad thing to realize you're being guarded by someone you'd never fully confess to, but that's half of any relationship. 
 ---thinking about my future - which always ends up turning into a vision of my burnt corpse in an overgrown, dandelioned backyard in the midwest during spring, getting eaten by a malnourished german shepherd. 
 the midwest is beautiful 
 ---you see old birthday cards you've kept for some reason and each one joins the swarming sharp things that make pulp of your heart. 
 ---you just ate a fudgesicle and it dominated your taste buds and you kept repeating ""fucking domination"" in your head until it's senseless and it's time to go to bed already? 
 ---you are a big monster made of wet newspaper and you get pushed down every three seconds and no one's afraid of you. 
 ---you built a small dwelling in your closet with some hangers and a sheet and you did this to avoid people, not to have fun. 
 ---you're older now than you've ever been and it's not something you look forward to continuing over and over endlessly. 
 you hear ambulance sounds and think they are for you and you like it 
 ---at the van buren bridge, watching traffic go beneath me and wondering if i can jump down and run along the tops of cars. 
 at the van buren bridge, laughing after i imagine how i'd land on the first car and fall violently to the ground, smashed and limp. 
 ---in the alley behind the 7-11, deciding it's time to walk home and be there. 
 halfway home, deciding to live beneath a car parked on the street. 
 halfway under the car parked on the street, deciding i can't fit. 
 ---you see people outside your window and you lean out the windowframe and go, ""hey, catch me ok"" then jump before there is an answer. 
 ---you really don't care what other people think and it's not at all like it was when you said that but didn't mean it. 
 ---you have never approved of yourself so you bother other people to do it. 
 you are an invisible trail of replicating statues each more fun to be around than the last. 
 you never help out people as much as they help you and that's the underside of something even uglier and it bothers you. 
 you have dumb hands. 
 you go to public ares and you expect people to group up and tell you you add nothing and you should leave, and you are willing to congratulate them on being right. 
 you don't argue. 
 you just ate so much cereal your stomach hurts bad. 
 you mention when someone else has stolen a relatively worthless pen because you have principles. 
 you think principles are real. 
 you eat things even if they aren't fully microwaved because you don't deserve any luxury. 
 you are the most beautiful motherfucker on the planet forever times the square root of 78,889. 
 you seem like a servant to someone you hope eventually asks you for something, for anything. 
 you get dead so slow. 
 you lost all your hair but i still love you. 
 you will feel pain. 
 you will not learn from it. 
 you will be mistreated by people, because somebody has to do it and at least you get to pick who. 
 you congratulate yourself on being right. 
 you are married to trying to defend yourself and you have soft gumlines for weapons you motherfucker. 
 you get preferential treatment in your own bad afterlife. 
 you are right to ruin yourself now so the afterlife will be a handicapped parking space. 
 you will not learn from it.

 i'm glad to all of those that love all of his stuff. at my college graduation, the speaker was a gruff professor. he was one of those older men whom people somewhat patronizingly describe as a teddy bear to convey the idea that while he looks like santa claus, they wouldn't be surprised to see him arraigned on assault charges at the local courthouse. i liked this professor in general, and his graduation speech was a grand: warm congratulations on a crisp early-summer day. he decided to inform us, however, that anyone who had not read the iliad and the odyssey should not be graduating from college. i was one of those lucky (lucky?) folks, like an illiterate kid graduating from high school. 
 i decided to rectify the situation as soon as possible, and i spent an indefinite number of hours in the next few, sunny weeks laying in a hammock on my porch, the boy i loved commiserating with me about this wonderful book. it is a warm, sharp memory. that was mumble mumble years ago, and this summer, i thought that since i just graduated again, i would read it again. it was a good choice. warm, summer days in the hammock with limb-chopping, flashing helms, and mountain goats rushing down the hillside. 
 i can't find this quote i'm thinking of, but i'm pretty sure it's from beowulf, and it goes something like, ""brave men should seek fame in foreign lands."" google does not think that quote exists, so maybe i dreamed it, which is really neither here nor there, but kind of weird. something about that quote, about this book, and about the way this book reminds me of that quote, makes my blood beat close to my skin. i get this feeling that my heart grows too big for my ribs, and my eyeballs get tight, as though i'm going to cry. but, my heart doesn't pound, and no tears come. 
 that is how this book feels to me. 
 this story is about what homer doesn't describe as much as what he does, and reading it evokes some kind of mirroring response from my body. the iliad is the almost-death of achilles, the almost-destruction of troy, and reading it is an almost-panic-attack, an almost-sob. it is the absent top step in a flight of stairs. but, oh man, that flight of stairs. how do you even make that? 
 it's not possible to spoil this story because homer is always one step ahead, tripping you up about what story he's telling. so, just because i think it's fun (and, also because it seems kind of absurd to write a ""review"" of the iliad, so i'm wandering in the dark here), i'm going to give a brief summary: 
 this story is about a bunch of guys fighting over some women fleshlights and jewelry. mostly the women fleshlights. everyone's been at this war for nine years (sidebar: weirdly, when i read that it was nine years, i thought, ""nine years? who would fight a war for that long? oh, wait . . . .""). as you probably know, the war initially started because paris, a trojan, stole helen, who was the iphone 5 of fleshlights, from menelaus, an argive. the argives are at their ships; the trojans are in ilium, behind the city walls. there's lots of blood and guts and pillaging throughout. 
 this story, homer clearly tells us, is about paris and helen's betrayal of menelaus, and it is about the death of achilles. the story opens with agamemnon, the king of the argives, having stolen a fancy new fleshlight from achilles, who is a child of a water nymph. achilles refuses to continue fighting if agamemnon is going to take his fleshlight. then, achilles has this beautiful, beautiful moment where he questions the very nature of fighting over fleshlights. we are all pawns in the petty squabbles of the gods. 
 the gods are easily my favorite parts of this story, though it is not really about them in a certain way. it is not really about them in the way that any discussion of a god is not really about the god. on the one hand, it is about how our lives are just pawns in this squabbling, incestuous, eternal thanksgiving dinner in the sky. on the other hand, it is still about the pawns. the gods are compelling on their own, but my heart tries to escape my chest not because of their story, but because, yes, humans do live and die by some kind of petty lottery run by a rapist married to his sister. yes. and maybe there is someone bold and wonderful in the sky, like the grey-eyed athena, but we still live and die by the thunder of a maniacal drunk uncle. yes, that seems true. 
 so, in the midst of the chopping of limbs, the shatteringly beautiful similes, death after death, and the machinations of the dysfunctional immortal family, this story is about the betrayal of menelaus and the death of achilles. the thing that is absolutely, hands-down the most insane about this story to me is that those two events are deeply vivid in my mind in connection to this book, but neither of them actually happens here. how is that possible?! how do you plant enough seeds about an event in a reader's mind that when she closes a book, those seeds grow into whole, robust images about the event? my blood does that thing where it tries to get out of my skin just from thinking about that. i can picture achilles's death so vividly, picture lying in that hammock and reading it after i graduated from college, but that never happened. homer just planted the seeds of his death in my brain, and they grew from my constant pondering over them. helen and paris sailing away grew in my mind through helen's beautiful regrets. 
 this is a story that i could think about for days: helen's mourning, like the women i've seen apologize for causing their husbands' abuse (no, you didn't cause this); war, and the futility of killing each other, as though we are controlled by the kardashians of the sky. what causes violence? we say women cause violence because they push our buttons, so we're driven to maim and kill because of the betrayals and button pushing. we say that something eternal, god or the gods, cause violence because they control our fate, they appear to us as birds and as wisdom and lead us on our night-blind path of life, but they lead us erratically: drunk, hysterical drivers and us with no seat belt, so we grasp for mere survival. homer describes those motivations for violence so beautifully. 
 but, ultimately i think that is all bullshit, and i think the bullshitness of it is there in this story, too. it is there in achilles challenging agamemnon. it is there in achilles mourning patroclus. oh, patroclus, about whom i haven't even freaked in this review. what a shame. anyway, though, people are not violent because we were betrayed or because of supernatural trickery. our violence is ours; it is our choice and our responsibility. life is barbarous and cruel around us, but that is its nature, and we can only shape ourselves through and around it. when we expect life to be gentle and obedient, we are usually doing nothing more than justifying our own cruelty. i don't think there is an answer to any of this in the iliad, but it is beautifully told in both the positive and negative space. it is blood-poundingly, eye-achingly told. as my professor said, everyone should read this, and if you can read it in the sun, lying in a hammock after your graduation, all the better.

 'hbh bbst@... kthyr through teaching my mother how to give birth the empowerment of women becomes like a burning tempest kindled up by the rawness of warsan shire's words. the poems are also about reality, the horrors that some people have to face in a word driven by war. they carry with them such human depth, none more so than the poem in love and in war. 
 ""to my daughter i will say 
 'when the men come, set yourself on fire.'"" 
 the poem is only two lines, but it establishes the tone for the rest of the work; it acts like a summary for one of her strongest ideals, that of personal and cultural integrity. 
 shire does not compromise. the idea of setting oneself on fire is tangible to suicide. the men are coming, the soldiers and sons of war, so let us end it before they can touch us. this can be read as an act by a woman burning herself to avoid the objectifying effects that are coming her way. historically speaking, the women of an invaded country often become the greatest victims. we all know what humans can do when in a blood frenzy. by committing suicide these daughters can avoid the worse of such possible crimes. but the act of setting oneself on fire can be read in a different way, a much brighter way. 
 like all great poetry, multiple readings come out of shire's words. i like to think of the fire as a metaphorical flame of individuality. when the invaders come, set your hearts ablaze and remember who you are; remember your culture; remember your language: remember you. when the men come do no lose this sense of you to the superimposing of another's beliefs. become angry, fight against it, rage at the injustice and learn how to beat it. but at the very root of it all, never ever forget. in such an idea shire establishes the authority of the individual's voice. 
 how about love? as a woman entering a relationship set yourself on fire in the same sense, do not become meek and docile: do not allow him to take over. this reading feels like one of the strongest. if you compare this to the ideas that are manifested in the spoken word poem for women who are difficult to love it becomes more evident. the ideas empower women and suggest that if you are volatile, if your personality is like that of a fire, do not quench yourself: carry on. be yourself, he is not worthy if he cannot love you for you: keep that fire burning. 
 there's also another reading that comes here, tangible to the first instance of suicide. when men are near and love is close, set yourself on fire and avoid heartache. but, i do not overly belief in this one; it can be read in the poem, but when comparing it to shire's body of work it seems far too pessimistic. shire is about empowering women not destroying life. she is a humanist; thus, there is much to be taken from her words. they are words that need to be heard now more than ever as the world becomes increasingly multi-cultural and transgendered, understanding the perspective of others is vital for the development of a more accepting world. this is a very powerful collection of poetry. moving on, as a concept, is for stupid people, because any sensible person knows grief is a long-term project. 
 this is a book about two boys and their father dealing with their mother's death. 
 it's a very unusual book. 
 unusual because their ""grief counsellor"" is a crow. yes, a black bird. 
 unusual because only at the end do we truly know what happened to the mother. 
 unusual because, in truth, it doesn't matter how the mother died, but what happens to those left behind. 
 unusual for its language which is cryptic at times - especially when crow first arrives (i had to read that one chapter three times and still only had a vague idea what the author was trying to say) and very simple but heavy at others. 
 the story is being told in chapters of ""crow"", ""dad"" and ""boys"" and shows how each party is feeling about and dealing with the situation. and it doesn't sugarcoat anything. gradually, a more complete picture emerges and a progression can be seen. 
 in between, there is lots of wonderful prose. sometimes even funny (especially the chapter about gran) passages. 
 to me, the important message is the quote at the beginning of this review. and the fact that this family is not ""functional"", as society would call it, after the mother has died. they do everything their own way and that's ok because everyone griefs differently and the world needs to finally accept and respect that! 
 also, i loved the concept of crow staying with them until they no longer need it (a bit like nanny mcfee, but the true origin story of crow is so lovely). 
 it's a small book but full of wonderfully resounding lines that strike a deep cord with the reader and stay with you for a long time. inconspicuous yet enormously powerful. scattering 
 words 
 on 
 different 
 lines 
 is 
 not 
 poetry! i have read some rather hilarious discussions over the last day across social media regarding bob dylan's right, or lack thereof, to the noble literature prize. 
 one of the funniest was a rather lengthy post by an unnamed individual who defined ""true literature."" according to his infinite wisdom, this excludes all poetry and song. you see, novels are the most complex form of literary expression because they are the longest and most thought out; therefore, dylan isn't literature. another post claimed that literature is the written word, so dylan's work being spoken/sung means it's also not literature: its music. 
 these people clearly have never read a poem so they should keep their ignorant mouths shut! 
 now i had trouble not setting these people to rights. i mean opinion of the arts is always a subjective thing, highbrow or lowbrow, it's all about personal reaction. but that is beside the point here. objectively speaking, dylan's work is literature. there's no two ways about it, no room for discussion, only fact. words set to rhythm, with metre, are a form of poetry. stick some instruments in the background and it becomes music, but it's still poetry: they just become lyrics. people who fail to recognise this fact ignore the point of poetry. most poetry is meant to be spoken, and some cannot be read without singing. dylan's work is literature, and for all his contribution to the arts he deserves the noble prize. 
 to say otherwise is to ignore countless generations of oral tradition, and by extension spit in the face of poetry itself. this collection of poetry here isn't why dylan won the prize. this is mainly experimental stuff and it isn't as good as his music. it's his lyricism that did it, but this seems an appropriate place to have a little rant about stupid people who don't understand literature."," 2/7/2017 
 i get likes on this review daily and for a long time i've felt like a 3-star review was too generous so i lowered it to 2 today which is more accurate in hindsight 
 7/11/2016 
 if i could sum up my thoughts about this book it would just be ""oh"" 
 honestly very underwhelming i'm not sure why people go crazy about this book and say it's gorgeous and it's their favorite book because honestly it's very plain some poems are just basic sentences with random skips that have no real point they aren't too lyrical and it's literally just like reading a normal sentence i expected i would love every page of this but i only marked 4 poems this just was nothing new the concepts in this poem especially when it rolled around to the feminism aspects just didn't wow me an entire poem just about ""you don't need a man you want a man"" was just a repeat of things i've been hearing for years it wasn't interesting and a lot of the poems just sounded so pretentious because it was just plain text with no punctuation and random skips in the lines being fed to the reader as art someone mentioned this was a little too ""tumblr"" and i agree it was a quick read but just a little bit frustrating because it was too simple too familiar the art was nice and a few of the poems were well-written but for the most part it seems like very little effort was put into this which makes me sad because that's such a mean criticism for an artist who puts so much emotion into her work okay i have finally reviewed this it has been sitting in my windowsill-stack of ""books i gotta review"" long enough and i just can't look at it anymore as little as i wanted to revisit it i feel anxious when i have placeholders or blank spaces in the review field so here goes nothing 
 i give every author three chances to impress me you know the old saying: fool me once - shame on you fool me twice shame on me fool me three times - it's back on you 
 and sometimes it pans out - hermann hesse had a great last-minute save with demian after failing to wow me with either siddhartha or narcissus and goldmund jane austen i am sorry to say got her three shots and none of them made me see what all the fuss was about 
 this one well this one's on me 
 that is a picture of the folded-over pages in my copy of this book each one representing a poem in this collection that i found problematic in some way: sloppy rhyme/meter/rhythm misused words superficial abstractions vague intention masked by ""pretty"" conceits and just general ""offness"" no one has the time or inclination to go through the whole book with a red pen but i'll refer to some specific examples in this review lest anyone think my negativity is some knee-jerk bitterness over the nonsense that happened on my thread for love and misadventure and then continued to escalate outside of goodreads in situations that were very character-revealing 
 remember hikers sometimes nature will put its poison in a pretty pretty flower 
 when you write a book and it becomes popular you have two choices as a writer: you can either stick with what has already proven successful and continue in the same vein or you can take a risk; evolve as a writer and deliver something that shows you have range beyond your first time out there are risks and rewards no matter which way you choose: taking risks can sometimes end in failure losing the fans who liked your early stuff but maybe gaining the respect of discriminating readers who appreciate risk staying the same might satisfy your already established fans but people who didn't like the first book aren't going to like the second book 
 this book is not taking any risks and is exactly the same kind of singsongy pap as the first book and there are even six poems from love & misadventure reprinted at the end in case you wanted to revisit them 
 it's another collection about love and obsession and regret and breakup woe and the joy of defining yourself in terms of another person's feelings for you there's no growth in the writing; both the subject matter and the way it is expressed are extremely infantile 
 although this time she's all growed up and gettin' racy and in one of her prose pieces after some pillow-talk lover's fantasy about stealing a book from a bookstore which is already douchey enough the piece ends like so: 
 then do you know what i'd do 
 what - would - you -do she says between peals of laughter 
 i'd take you out fuck you up against the car 
 stay classy lang leav 
 it's revealing to me that most of the glowing reviews of lang leav's books on here have expressed some variation of ""this is my first poetry book"" or ""i never liked poetry before this"" and that's great - it's always encouraging to see people enthusiastic about books regardless of what the book actually is - every reader their book and yadda and i understand that language is a constantly evolving creature - the word ""tragedy"" has become less-specific than its original meaning in colloquial usage while ""decimate"" has broadened in scope and words like ""literally"" and ""epic"" have had their meanings obliterated completely and semantic bleaching morphs words all the time but ""poetry"" too has poetry become ""anything written in choppy little line breaks"" i'm not even a huge fan of poetry but i know that it's more than just words scattered on a page and don't give me that ""free verse"" nonsense because even free verse has rules and here are some of them: 
 free verse is poetry that is based on the irregular rhythmic cadence recurring with variations of phrases images and syntactical patterns rather than the conventional use of meter in other words free verse has no rhythm scheme or pattern however much poetic language and devices are found in free verse 
 rhyme may or may not be used in free verse but when rhyme is used it is used with great freedom in other words free verse has no rhyme scheme or pattern 
 free verse does not mean rhyme cannot be used only that it must be used without any pattern 
 so for example a poem like this: 
 cannot be deemed ""free verse"" because there is an attempt at patterned rhyme it's just poorly done if you're going to make the effort to rhyme follow through and be consistent otherwise the reader will find the hiccup grating and it just ruins any emotional connection you may have had to the poem because you are taken out of the moment and you have to start over and see what the hell happened if you're going to choose to be rhyme-y - be rhyme-y - you can't go rogue in the middle or the end of a poem find a way to make it work or abandon the idea of rhyme scheme altogether if it's clipping your wings because honestly - greeting card rhyme patterns do not a sophisticated poem make and i don't understand her commitment to this style when she can't even seem to do it correctly half of the time 
 this one okay this one is free verse - hooray 
 but here leaving aside the jejeune sentiment and the tra la la of it which may be appealing to some readers there's a structural problem here in the scansion; the way the reader is led along by the nose in a consistent cadence and meter until that off-putting stumble over the finish line it's terrible execution and shows complete disregard for the reader 
 and this is something that occurs frequently throughout this collection - one lazy rhyme in the middle of a poem that otherwise has a very rigid rhyme scheme which throws the whole thing off or one dissonant rhythm break that makes you wince 
 it's not just the rhyme scheme and scansion - there's also just plain lousy editing 
 this is the second poem in the book ""i would not nearly had so much"" is not the way you want to introduce a collection 
 but wait there's more 
 this book also contains a number of prose pieces many of which are trying so hard to be clever and conceptual through the conceit of personifying abstractions (patience and love agreed to meet at a set time and place; beneath the twenty-third tree in the olive orchard) but they're so forced and artless capitalizing a word does not automatically make it meaningful you gotta supply the meaning with the other words 
 there was a girl named despondency who loved a boy named altruistic and he loved her in return 
 for grammatical/semantic balance shouldn't that be ""altruism"" or ""despondent"" noun/noun or adjective/adjective this is what is so frustrating - it's all surface-pretty but utterly thoughtless you can be as surprising or poetic as you like but there should also be lyrical elegance there's no sense that any effort went into the writing of these no going back and rereading to make sure these words work together it's all churn with no meaning 
 and jesus this: 
 that is the complete poem and it's a mess analogies are meant to be gracefully balanced comparisons of the relationships between disparate things (hot is to cold as fire is to ice) but this one is ass-backwards as anyone studying for the sats could tell you i assume she's riffing off the adage that ""time heals all wounds"" and she's aware that a suture is used to close a wound which is a literal comparison to the metaphorical healing that time performs but in the syntax she's using here she's basically saying that ""wounds heal all sutures"" which is incorrect and i'm sure she thought it sounded pretty and was so darn proud of her rhyme she thought no one would notice how sloppy and illogical it was but i certainly did 
 these instances of ""i am making pretty words say things that sound kinda smart and poetical"" but make no sense occur frequently like sometimes when i read a book parts will lift from the pages in an anagram of your name like a code to remind me it's not over like dyslexia in reverse which makes my head hurt too much to even begin to parse 
 and it goes on and on - incomplete thoughts missing words elisions: 
 how they easily what 
 what is the ""it"" here; the reason for their being does this refer to ""time is told by seeing"" so - ""time is told by seeing"" is the reason for the existence of clocks what the shit does that mean and why did this insight necessitate a poem 
 leaving aside the fact that a circle is a line are we supposed to fill in the blanks ourselves ""towards"" is a preposition and requires a noun or a pronoun to complete the thought which i assume in this case is ""you"" but again - really sloppy syntax and this is what is so galling and made me so furious reading this collection - the sacrifice of meaning for the sake of rhythm in some instances while so frequently being cavalier about maintaining consistent rhythm in others 
 more slipshod scansion more jacked-up sentence structure to compete with to compete for to compete in finish your thought 
 and i know that some people love these poems because omg the feels and maybe this is a generational thing or a byproduct of people who get book deals based on their internet popularity where there is less editorial oversight and maybe my complaints about this put me in the same category as people who complain about the infantilization of america with its grown men in baseball caps and those kids and their video games and how all the pop stars are under the drinking age and that's not music why in my day and get off my lawn but maybe it's just disgust at the fact that people are willingly shelling out seventeen dollars for a hundred or so carelessly-written poems many of which do not exceed eight lines and it's the poetic equivalent of nursery food 
 and that is what i thought of this book 
 and i know i'm gonna have all these people come out and tell me how much they liked this book and how it changed their life and how wrong i am for scrutinizing it because poetry is like rainbows and it is immune to judgment and yay for you if you liked this and it had value for you sincerely but opinions and an asshole - i have both and even my asshole thought this collection was unsophisticated and sloppy

 2014: 
 pulitzer prize nominee maya angelou in the year of her death writes a poem commemorating the life of nobel peace prize recipient nelson mandela (who died in december 2013 but that's pretty much 2014) and we honor their lives by allowing this to win the 2014 goodreads best poetry award: 
 stay 
 the words i heard 
 from you today 
 are said when 
 there's nothing 
 left to say 
 what i would give 
 to make you stay 
 i would give it 
 all away 
 i was hoping i wouldn't have to read this but goodreads voters have forced my hand 
 i'll let you know if it's any good his parents did well naming him shel 
 he never did care to conform 
 what would compel a guy to rebel 
 if everyone knew him as norm student: 
 hey professor i could use a hand 
 i just read a play i didn't understand 
 professor: 
 and what was this play pray 
 student: 
 faust the one you assigned the other day 
 i simply can't wrap my mind around it; 
 i read it carefully but i am left confounded 
 professor: 
 i have alas studied philosophy 
 literature history and poetry 
 i have some time that i can set aside; 
 so i will do my best to be your guide 
 student: 
 gosh thanks so where should i start 
 i suppose at the most conspicuous part: 
 the language it was strangely various; 
 both in style and quality it was multifarious 
 one moment it is regal and poetic; 
 other moments it is hasty and frenetic 
 doggerel alternates with highfalutin; 
 at times colossal at others lilliputian 
 professor: 
 perhaps the translation was abysmal 
 student: 
 actually i read the german original 
 professor: 
 ah i see; please go on 
 student: 
 i hope you won't think i'm a moron 
 but i also thought the drama lacking; 
 even though faust does all this yacking 
 about his tortured soul his weary spirit 
 i found his actions downright incoherent 
 he alternately scorns the world and yearns-- 
 for what what does he wish to learn 
 although supposedly full of all these riddles 
 i found him a bit superficial 
 in short it's hard to care about his fate 
 when all he does is whine and prate 
 professor: 
 what about mephistopheles 
 student: 
 with him i was somewhat more pleased 
 he has at least a bit of spice; 
 his naughtiness is rather nice 
 professor: 
 and how did you like the plot 
 student: 
 that actually perplexed me a lot 
 for one it's not a tragedy 
 since the play ends happily 
 and what was with walpurgis night 
 yes it was fun but it didn't seem right 
 to interrupt the action so severely 
 so pointlessly and cavalierly 
 some critics admire that scene ""it's po-mo"" 
 they say but i say ""oh no"" 
 and what was with valentine 
 he sticks around for just one scene 
 and if i am to be concise 
 he struck me as a plot device 
 to be honest from what i gleaned 
 i can't tell why this is so esteemed 
 it was nice and all but i find it queer 
 that goethe is compared with shakespeare 
 professor: 
 i can understand the plight you're in 
 it's hard to know where to begin 
 goethe is a slippery fellow; 
 reading him is like juggling jello 
 he was a touch mercurial; 
 often brilliant occasionally dull 
 he was a dabbler through and through 
 there wasn't anything he wouldn't do 
 or at least try; which is partly why 
 the language goes from low to high 
 student: 
 certainly he was heterogeneous; 
 but why do you think he was a genius 
 professor: 
 in some ways he was like faust; 
 he studied all and all renounced 
 he was skeptical of all modes of thought; 
 and found faults in everything he sought 
 his distrust of tidiness 
 is why the play is such a mess 
 if reality is in disarray 
 so shouldn't be his play 
 student: 
 this strikes me as just an excuse 
 professor: 
 everyone is entitled to their views 
 yet consider goethe's sophistication; 
 in him there is no mystification 
 in renouncing reason he does not turn 
 to superstition but instead learns 
 to spread his mind in all directions; 
 at once seeking through reflection 
 to transcend all worldly views 
 while remaining coarse and worldly too 
 his wisdom soars above and crawls below; 
 it is both cheap and tawdry and it glows 
 and grows expanding ever and anon-- 
 here one moment in another gone 
 he was in short a universal man; 
 easy to admire hard to understand 
 student: 
 so was he faust or mephisto 
 professor: 
 he was both he was both 
 i highly recommend kaufmann's edition it has the original german and his fine translation (which i frequently had to turn to for help) on the facing pages plus he includes a finely written if a bit fawning introduction *thank you so much to indigo for surprising me with a copy of this* 
 i never read milk & honey it just seemed like such a fad thing i had no interest in it i tend to prefer traditional poetry it's just my inner english major coming out i suppose that being said i enjoyed this more than i had expected i didn't love the whole thing but there were some poems that i really loved the poetic style is quite simplistic and some quotes i felt like were reworded versions of things i've seen before but i liked the fact that this collection dealt with femininity immigration and self love the topics were well developed and the poems were short but packed a punch not sure if i'll now pick up milk & honey we'll see milk and honey is a collection of poetry and prose about survival about the experience of violence abuse love loss and femininity it is split into four chapters and each chapter serves a different purpose 
 it's difficult trying to review this because every poem is extremely personal tender and exquisite in its own way 
 so i decided to feature some of my favorite ones: 
 ""you tell me to quiet down cause 
 my opinions make me less beautiful 
 but i was not made with a fire in my belly 
 so i could be put out 
 i was not made with a lightness on my tongue 
 so i could be easy to swallow 
 i was made heavy 
 half blade and half silk 
 difficult to forget and not easy 
 for the mind to follow"" 
 ""i struggle so deeply 
 to understand 
 how someone can 
 pour their entire soul 
 blood and energy 
 into someone 
 without wanting 
 anything in 
 return 
 - i will have to wait till i'm a mother"" 
 ""when my mother says i deserve better 
 i snap to your defense out of habit 
 he still loves me i shout 
 she looks at me with defeated eyes 
 the way a parent looks at their child 
 when they know this is the type of pain 
 even they can't fix 
 and says 
 it means nothing to me if he loves you 
 if he can't do a single wretched thing about it"" 
 ""he only whispers i love you 
 as he slips his hands 
 down the waistband 
 of your pants 
 this is where you must 
 understand the difference 
 between want and need 
 you may want that boy 
 but you certainly 
 don't need him"" 
 ""i am a museum full of art 
 but you had your eyes shut"" 
 ""people go 
 but how 
 they left 
 always stays"" 
 ""what i miss most is how you loved me but what i didn't know was how you loved me had so much to do with the person i was it was a reflection of everything i gave to you coming back to me how did i not see that how did i sit here soaking in the idea that no one else would love me that way when it was i that taught you when it was i that showed you how to fill the way i needed to be filled how cruel i was to myself giving you credit for my warmth simply because you had felt it thinking it was you who gave me strength wit beauty simply because you recognized it as if i was already not these things before i met you as if i did not remain all these once you left"" 
 ""loneliness is a sign you are in desperate need of yourself"" 
 ""you tell me 
 i am not like most girls 
 and learn to kiss me with your eyes closed 
 something about the phrase--something about 
 how i have to be unlike the women 
 i call sisters in order to be wanted 
 makes me want to spit your tongue out 
 like i am supposed to be proud you picked me 
 as if i should be relieved you think 
 i am better than them"" 
 ""other women's bodies 
 are not our battlegrounds"" 
 ""you were a dragon long before 
 he came around and said 
 you could fly 
 you will remain a dragon 
 long after he's left"" 
 ""you look at me and cry 
 everything hurts 
 i hold you and whisper 
 but everything can heal"" 
 ""how you love yourself is 
 how you teach others 
 to love you"" 
 ""what terrifies me most is how we 
 foam at the mouth with envy 
 when others succeed 
 but sigh in relief 
 when they are failing 
 our struggle to 
 celebrate each other is 
 what's proven most difficult 
 in being human"" 
 (most of my favorite quotes were from the healing section and it was pretty though trying to narrow it down to my preferred quotes) 
 it also featured some pretty amazing illustrations which i'm always up for in books: 
 overall this collection was exquisite and exactly what i needed right now milk and honey is definitely going to stay on my mind for a while and i hope to come back to it time and again 
 45 stars 
 *note: i'm an amazon affiliate if you're interested in buying milk and honey just click on the image below to go through my link i'll make a small commission* 
 this review and more can be found on my blog 45 
 ugh so good i don't have any original insights to share from this most recent of god-knows-how-many readings but this time through i was really struck by: 
 1) what a damn fine piece of stagecraft this is from the suspenseful moody opening on the castle battlements to the solemn dead march carrying the prince offstage and 
 2) how shakespeare seems to want hamlet's personality--particularly the wellspring of his actions (and lack of action)--to remain an enigma and that he achieves this by infusing the character with so much of himself--so much wit and poetry so much despondency and savagery--that the result is that the audience simply bows before the great mystery of human personality and that this reverence for the unknown lurking in the heart of an extraordinary man intensifies the sense of pity horror and waste that fills us at the end of the play well that was underwhelming 
 i don't really like poetry that much to begin with but i was so curious about this book after seeing so many people loving it so i decided to give it a go i was expecting it to be really profound and ground-breaking and it just wasn't there were maybe a dozen poems that were quite impactful but the majority of them felt like filler to me st@ msrhyt ltshykhwf knt jmy`h tdwr 'hdthh fy lryf lrwsy why@ mn yqymwn fy hdh lryf wkl msrhy@ t`lj mwdw` mkhtlf

 roses are red 
 violets are blue 
 all my base 
 are belong to you 
 as painfully silly as it is that little snippet is still significantly better than the poetry in this book at least it wasn't meant to be taken seriously unless i've missed something and this book is meant to be some grand satire of the artistic sort in which case carry on 
 if you think this is good poetry: 
 to love him 
 is something 
 i hold highly 
 suspicious 
 like having something 
 so very delicious--- 
 then being told 
 to do the dishes 
 and you still think it is good poetry beyond the age of 9 we seriously need to have a talk and if you are one such person on my friend list kindly remove yourself from it posthaste 
 why the fuck is the rating so high suspicious i just want to start off by saying that ""through me you enter into the city of woes"" would make an excellent tramp stamp jump on it 
 being that i am an atheist living in the ""bible belt"" i was certain that reading this would lead to some sort of goodreads tirade which can at times feel about as good as vomiting up a sour stomach oryou knowdoing other stuff like shit that ladies don't do however i was from the outset hypnotized by dante's tres baudelaire-esque-grotesque imagery and overall style for such a holy shitfuck he had quite the murky mind he was dreaming up torture scenarios that wouldn't even begin to be trumped until gilles de rais and vlad tepes came around like a century later and don't be surprised if he zaps you with the occasional rotting pustule or maggot-infested knife wound these aren't literal examples but they illustrate just how the opposite of flowery some of his language is so i went into reading this with a huge wall up (i know i know a terrible way to read) but then i realized that i wasn't just going to be proselytized toi was going to be threatened with nasty rotting coldsore-herpee-mange-pits all over my body that george w bush and paris hilton are going to take turns pouring their boiling-hot-diarrhea-snot into dante you sick bastard awesome 
 so onward i galloped discerning through all the filthy language that: 
 a) i am in fact going to hell 
 b) they will have trouble determining the circle i will end up in because i could be placed in every single one of them save maybe like one or two (i stopped counting after awhile) 
 c) the dalai lama too is going to hell* 
 *in fact the ""higher-ups"" are apparently so sadistic they sent people to hell who had lived morally just lives but were born before the coming of christ he'll punish you for not worshiping him before you even know who he is if there was ever a better use for ""wtf"" i don't know what it is that's like your mom smacking you in the mouth for getting pregnant while you're still a virgin or like wanting to ban a book that you haven't even seen in real life yet that means that every intelligent being for the first few billions of years is in hell right now all of 'em every evolutionary step forward up to the first homosapien christian is a batch of poor bastards that has been ferried across the river styx harsh 
 i mean seriouslyeven moses and noah were in hell until jesus came through with the vip passes apparently the wholly omniscient creator forgot to put them on the guest list ain't that some shit 
 one specific gripe about the storyi'm not digging this whole ""emasculated devil"" thing i mean wallowing in your own filth freezing your ass off with bitch-tears in your eyes at all times this is the malevolent force that the christians live in constant fear of seriously it's a non-stop temptation to be like him come on everybody knows the devil is confusingly sexy and he likes to smoke fancy cigars and drink brandy and wear fine suits and tell hilarious jokes how else is he supposed to charm us away from the true path keep up dantesheesh 
 forgive me father for i have sinned the end 
 oh and if you hated this review i have a back-up review below:

 ____________________________________ 
 1 when i use the first-person singular pronoun i am here referring to my normal persona i have also at various times maintained other personas for example between 1999 and 2001 i used to play chess regularly on the kasparovchess site under the handle ""swedish_chick"" 
 i find this a strange example of what makes people believe things everyone was extremely skeptical on first meeting her; but for some reason as soon as they discovered that she actually could speak fluent swedish they were also ready to believe that she was an attractive 26 year old graduate student living in stockholm i still can't explain why this might be 
 2 people liked hearing stories about chick as she was known to my circle of friends at the time i was working at a start-up in cambridge england and one of my colleagues was a young woman i will call g g took a lively interest in chick and helped me considerably with the development of the back-story chick borrowed several features from her; in particular everyone for some reason wanted to know if chick was blonde and the agreed-on answer was ""yes during the summer at least"" even more remarkably g began to acquire features from chick which went as far as learning swedish and moving to linkoping in order to do a phd there 
 3 the stories about chick would fill a small book she was a charming person and i've often wished that i were as nice as she was she was always happy to play chess with lower-rated players and commented encouragingly on their progress when people became abusive as inevitably happens on the web she never lost her cool she would occasionally give regular opponents glimpses of her private life but only after she had known them for some time and felt she could trust them the back-story was in fact quite complicated even though it was hardly ever used; she was bisexual and had a female lover in california that she sometimes visited no one was ever told this straight out however 
 it was inevitable that men would fall for this wonderfully attractive person the first time i managed to hide successfully and he went away after a while (she had poignantly reminded him of a brief encounter he had had many years ago that he'd always regretted not following up) the second time it was too complicated her admirer was a regular habitue of kasparovchess and kept pestering her for a date in real life he offered to take her on vacation in germany and seemed completely smitten with great regret we had to terminate chick 
 4 one day at work we were discussing clerihews we looked up some examples on the web suddenly g started laughing uncontrollably; she had been visited by divine inspiration she rushed to her laptop and shortly afterwards mailed out the following very fine poem: 
 manny rayner could be saner 
 plays chess in a dress 
 my friend is nothing if not pc i'm sorry that i can't remember the exact text of the accompanying note but she made it clear that she was not literally implying that i wore women's clothes when i impersonated chick and that if i had chosen to do so she would have regarded it as a completely defensible exercise of my right to wear apparel that expressed my personality in whatever way i chose 
 this review is in my book what pooh might have said to dante and other futile speculations ""you can recognize a small truth because its opposite is a falsehood the opposite of a great truth is another truth"" 
 - niels bohr 
 i was thinking about dante the other day and wondering how one could approach him from the angle of a goodreads review one of the obvious problems is that he lived a long time ago and many of the cultural referents have changed you're constantly having to think ""well nowadays what he's saying would correspond to that"" it isn't so bad in hell when there is plenty of entertainment to be had in seeing how the different sins are punished and indulging your schadenfreude then purgatory tells a moral story that's more or less timeless if you go for that sort of thing but once you arrive in paradise it starts getting seriously tricky a lot of the stuff at first sight just seems irrelevant to the 21st century world all these explanations about the mechanics of ptolomaic astronomy and dante querying the inhabitants of heaven on obscure theological points it's notorious that readers most often give up somewhere in the third book i started wondering if there was any modern-day author one could identify with dante and if that might help us connect to his concerns and in fact i do have a suggestion that some people will no doubt condemn out of hand as completely heretical: richard dawkins 
 now of course i am aware that dante was deeply immersed in the christian world-view and dawkins is famous for being the world's most outspoken atheist but it's not quite as crazy as it first may seem dante was a christian to the core of his being but he was furious with the way the church was being run; he put several of its leaders notably pope boniface viii in hell on the other side i challenge anyone to read ""the ancestor's tale"" to the end and not at least for a moment entertain the idea that dawkins is in actual fact a deeply religious man he admits as much himself: as he puts it it's often not so much that he disagrees with conventionally religious people more that ""they are saying it wrong"" amen to that 
 as noted both dante and dawkins are extremely unhappy with the way mainstream religion is being organized the other characteristic that unites them for me is this passionate love for science one has to remember that for dante ptolomaic astronomy was state of the art stuff and the details of the angelic hierarchy were a topic of vital importance; of course he cross-examines the hosts of the blessed to find out more these days i imagine he would be trying to get inside information on what happened during the big bang before spontaneous symmetry breaking occurred whether or not the higgs particle really exists and how evolution produced human intelligence for dante there didn't seem to be any opposition between religious faith and science - they were part of the same thing i do wonder what he would have thought if he had been able to learn that many leading religious figures even in the early 21st century reject a large part of science as being somehow unreligious it's wrong to spend your life dispassionately trying to understand god's universe i can see him getting quite angry about this and deciding to rearrange the seating a little down in hell 
 i keep thinking that there's a book someone ought to write called ""five atheists you'll meet in heaven"" please let me know when it comes out; i'll buy a copy at once 
 ************************************** 
 ps i couldn't help wondering what paradise might have looked like if dante had been writing today obviously we wouldn't have the old geocentric model of the universe - it would be bang up to date i think there is now far more material for an ambitious poet to work with than there was in the 14th century for example when we get to the heaven of the galaxy i imagine him using this wonderful fact that all the heavy elements are made in supernova explosions ""we are all stardust"" as some people like to put it then when we get to the heaven of the cosmos we find that the light from the ""let there be light"" moment at the beginning of creation is still around - it's just cooled to 27 degrees k and appears as the cosmic background radiation but it's not completely uniform as the quantum fluctuations left over from the period when the universe was the size of an atomic nucleus are the beginnings of the galaxies created on the second day finally we reach the heaven of the multiverse and find that we are just one of many different universes it was necessary to create all of them so that random processes could make sure that a very small number would end up being able to support life how impious to assume that god would only be able to create one universe and have to tweak all the constants himself ybq~ lmhn mhn wn tmt` shbh bb`d lthqf@ 'w lblg@

 fy 20 fbryr 2015 there's all this debate over why satan is so appealing in paradise lost did milton screw up is he being cynical or a double-secret atheist and why is god such a dick 
 but no one asks whether say shakespeare screwed up in making iago so much fun; they just give him credit for writing an awesome villain and that's all milton's doing satan is tempting for us because satan is tempting for us that's the point of satan if milton didn't make him as appealing as possible he'd be doing satan a disservice and eve for that matter 
 similarly god's a dick because god's a dick you've read the old testament he's not exactly all flowers and hugs there either again milton's just being true to his characters and writing a great story while he's at it 
 there's slightly more to it than that yeah for example: it's hinted a little that god sets satan up to fall he gives a stern warning that anyone who disobeys him or his son will be cast out of heaven but since there's no sin or evil at the time of his speech why give the warning isn't that like saying ""don't touch these cookies while i'm gone"" to a kid who didn't realize there were cookies until you pointed them out 
 here's my advice to people considering reading paradise lost: read the first two books it starts with a bang and it's pretty amazing for a while it slows down a bit in books iii - vii so if you're not totally sold in the first two books (i was) you can either quit altogether with a fair idea of what milton sounds like or skip to books ix and x ix is the actual temptation and fall (especially fun if you're a misogynist) and x is an astonishing sequence where adam and eve contemplate suicide: 
 ""why am i mocked with death and lengthened out 
 to deathless pain how gladly would i meet 
 mortality my sentence 
 his dreadful voice no more 
 would thunder in my ears"" (adam x774 - 780) 
 ""we've totally mucked this up and our kids are gonna justifiably hate us because we got kicked out of paradise and maybe we should just quit while we're behind"" 
 but really the whole thing is worth it took me a while - it's intense stuff so i found that i had to read a book and then chew on it for a while to process it before moving to the next one - but it's cool 
 in book viii if you're cosmologically minded milton lays out the whole universe like giordano bruno he understands that our earth is a tiny speck in the universe and he gets that all the stars are suns like ours and therefore could have planets like ours around them he also thinks they might be inhabited; our species might not be god's only experiment elsewhere other adams and eves may have faced the same test of the tree of knowledge - and they might have passed it isn't that an amazing thought 
 in books xi and xii michael tells adam sortof all the rest of the stories in the old testament which of course boil down to: 
 ""so shall the world go on 
 to good malignant to bad men benign 
 under her own weight groaning"" (xii 537 - 539) 
 that's your fault there adam nice work 
 he rushes through them though and it makes me wonder whether milton had originally intended to retell the entire old testament but got bored or intimidated or something that would've been remarkable certainly paradise lost is better literature than the old testament is and significantly more coherent 
 it's also better literature than almost everything else second-best poem by a blind guy ever i have conquered the iliad i can truly call myself a greek mythology lover now 
 angst love honor angst family drama death angst did i mention angst no i'm not talking about beverly hills 90210 oh ancient greece you were a very mixed up angsty place 
 this is basically how it went down (these memes are dark and full of spoilers) 
 i've said it before and i'll say it again i was born too late where's the tardis when you need it milk and honey tore through my analytical mind and burrowed deep into my ultra-sensitive soul it slayed all my emotions my feminist desires and my love for vulnerable writing i may not know a lot about poetry but i do know a decent amount about feelings and rupi kaur brought all my feelings tumbling out with this gorgeous collection of poems she writes about love and loss trauma and femininity - subjects that i so happen to adore in spare yet thorough language she addresses what it feels like to be broken to be loved and to be stronger on one's own this collection while in many ways simple addresses some of the darkest and most hopeful matters of the human heart if you enjoy marinating in your feelings or if you often ponder topics like female empowerment getting over heartbreak or what it means to love i would recommend you check out milk and honey asap now i will include three of my favorite poems though i wish i could include them all 
 on calling women pretty: 
 ""i want to apologize to all the women 
 i have called pretty 
 before i've called them intelligent or brave 
 i am sorry i made it sound as though 
 something as simple as what you're born with 
 is the most you have to be proud of when your 
 spirit has crushed mountains 
 from now on i will say things like 
 you are resilient or you are extraordinary 
 not because i don't think you're pretty 
 but because you are so much more than that"" 
 on co-dependency: 
 ""you are in the habit 
 of co-depending 
 on people to 
 make up for what 
 you think you lack 
 who tricked you 
 into believing 
 another person 
 was meant to complete you 
 when the most they can do is complement"" 
 on what is most important: 
 ""most importantly love 
 like it's the only thing you know how 
 at the end of the day all this 
 means nothing 
 this page 
 where you're sitting 
 your degree 
 your job 
 the money 
 nothing even matters 
 except love and human connection 
 who you loved 
 and how deeply you loved them 
 how you touched the people around you 
 and how much you gave them"" l'n lnfs lt~ tr~ zl llh mr@ l tkhsh~ b`d dhlk 'shbh l'bls@  wl`yn lt~ tkthl blmh@ whd@ mn lml' l'`l~ l tgmdh 'wj` hdh l`lm

 ehhomer's right odysseus' version is better 
 ps do not try this story at home unless when you get there you're still capable of shooting your arrow into a narrow aperture 
 fagles' translation is excellent - the new standard - and bernard knox's enormous introduction is the best homeric essay i've ever read 
 a good companion read is hal roth's we followed odysseus - maybe not the most eloquent of books but he retraces odysseus's voyage (as best he can) in his sailboat which is a pretty rad idea i recreated his route as a google map here with notes on each of the stops i also wrote summaries of each book of the odyssey for a book club discussion; i've pasted them in the comments thread below if you're interested okay yeah that waswell not my favorite ever thing i feel like i just read my middle school aim away messages or 200 pages of emo myspace updates i need to go listen to some dashboard confessional stat 
 i love the idea i love the sentiments and the lessons and certainly the feminist ideas at work here if i saw any of the platitudes expressed in the ""you"" section on tumblr i'd happily reblog them i definitely appreciate the raw emotions that very clearly went into the writing of them and how personal the author was willing to get about her life but um ummmmmmmmm what the fuck 
 but thatwell that's just not the kind of poetry i respond to i find minimalist poetry extremely hit or miss and when i (very rarely) read poetry it's usual the lusher more ornate kind--or at least the more visually creative because thisi mean there's nothing new here it's generic tumblr platitudes it's emo angst that should be emblazoned over a picture of a sad girl on the beach and put on pinterest it's beyond basic metaphors and cliche imagery about hearts and stars and oceans it's

 to me that's just a waste of trees but hey to each their own 
 again i appreciate the raw angst here but it's pretty clunky there's no subtlety or nuance which is why it makes me think of 13 year old me just scribbling out pure feelings to the page because it was the only person who'd listen and all the feelings felt so new which i mean thank you for the nostalgia if that's what was intended but as a book of poetry--sophisticated poetry for the modern feminist--it's a hard pass i mean this book of poetry even touched on things that are very personal to me like grief but i got zero feels it was all so distant and buried in cliches

 lw nn lm nftrq inspired by paul legault's brilliant idea of translating emily dickinson's poems into english i thought immediately - i have to steal that idea so here are some of the ariel poems of sylvia plath translated into english i have of course tried my utmost to perform this task with tact discretion and good taste 
 ariel translated into english 
 elm 
 look let's get this straight i am a tree you are a woman we can never be together not in the way you'd like anyway plus you're kind of irritating 
 the rabbit catcher 
 i went out with this guy once and then i found out he liked to catch rabbits so he was toast i should have dimed the bastard 
 berck-plage 
 i went on holiday every single person in the whole hotel was talking about me behind my back i don't like bikinis don't even get me started on nude beaches 
 the other 
 i have something dead in my handbag tee hee also i scratched myself and made myself bleed i don't really recommend marriage 
 a birthday present 
 i got a present but i was thinking that if i unwrapped it it would bite my face off so i didn't hah 
 the bee meeting 
 i thought i'd like to join in village life and get involved with local societies and all that so i went to the bee keepers' meeting it was like something out of alfred hitchcock i liked it 
 stings 
 now i'm a real bee keeper i get blase about stings it's like a metaphor 
 the swarm 
 bees are kind of like nazis or the french i can't decide 
 wintering 
 country life can suck i wish i was a bee no i don't really that would be silly i think it would be silly maybe it wouldn't be silly 
 a secret 
 men are like big babies that drink beer and want you to wear high class lingerie okay that's not much of a secret 
 the applicant 
 i got this job as a temp so i was filing and i knew i could destroy them if i chose just like that but i didn't choose to that day 
 daddy 
 when i was little and my dad used to dress up in his ss uniform i used to think he looked so smart and handsome of course later the penny dropped 
 lesbos 
 you really shouldn't have taken the kittens and given them to the neighbours without a by-your-leave i think i am going to pour sulphuric acid on your head while you are sleeping i'll do it tonight yes 
 fever 103 
 i got one of those 48 hour bugs that's why he's still alive if i had any strength in my limbs i would have sulphuric-acided his head last night 
 cut

 poppies in october 
 have you noticed that everything is slowly dying of carbon-monoxide poisoning 
 lady lazarus

 letter in november 
 dear ted - fuck you - sylvia 
 death & co 
 cheer up things could be worse i could be dead oh no wait a minute - this is worse that would be better hmm 
 sheep in fog 
 well you know sheep aren't that bright to begin with so when you mix 'em up with a thick fog the results are hilarious goodreads should have a shelf for ""continually reading"" i think i have about six different translations of the bhagavad gita but i often end up with eknath easwaran's for its simplicity this is the book i re-read when i am writing a novel it keeps everything in perspective by reminding me to offer my effort to god to see my work as a service to others and to not worry about what happens after that the princess saves herself in this one was a fairly emotional read for me this poetry collection is divided into four different parts: the princess the damsel the queen & you and there were a lot of parts that really hit home (especially the princess) so much so that i had to put the collection down for a minute and think 
 the princess saves herself in this one explores life & all of its love loss grief healing empowerment & inspirations and i loved and felt everything deeply 
 here are a few poems that made me both contemplate and feel: 
 overall this collection harrowed and punctured my heart deeply

 this review and more can be found on my blog now that i'm reading the prophet again words that i read twenty-seven years ago still ring clearly in my mind as i read them again today it was a wonderful moment a few evenings ago to find myself reciting aloud and from memory passages that had struck me then--and now--to the very core kahlil gibran spent a couple of years revising the prophet since it is a short book the concepts come across as distilled the influences of his native lebanon as well as his love for scripture come through in the scriptural-like language i am savoring this book slowly this time taking little sips at a time 'nw~ 'n 'nzl llns

 =) i not only really like shakespeare's coriolanus: i also like the man coriolanus as he is revealed in the play sure he may be a hothead an arrogant bully an immature mama's boy with a proto-fascist personality but he is also a man of extraordinary physical courage and sincere personal modesty who would like nothing better than to do his warrior's duty and be left alone 
 unfortunately though his mother--whose values are also those of the roman republic--sees her son's patrician duty as including a consulship and the populist politicking it requires--which a proud and simple man like coriolanus can only experience as self-abasement--inevitably leads to his shame and eventually to his destruction he cannot be true both to his mother and his republic and to himself--and that is his tragedy 
 the verse of this play is often harsh and crabbed but it is a monumental crabbedness an imposing harshness--very much like the personality of its hero i've been reading this book for almost three years and it feels so good to finally have finished it 
 i was surprised by what i found in here poe was slightly different to what i thought he is very much shrouded in shadow and the macabre at least his more successful stories and poems were but there were also some very basic stories in here some that felt like they weren't even written by the same person for every great piece of literature there were two mediocre ones i disliked the crime stories in particular the best ones for me were the ones where the narrator laments a lost love on the cusp of insanity: these stories were simply beautiful 
 here's my top two the only two i consider to be literary perfection: 
 the raven 
 shall we descend into madness shall we be haunted by our own desires shall we be consumed by that terrible facet of life known only as death shall we cling to what cannot be reanimated shall we wish for a return of something that has long been in darkness 
 shall we become obliterated by the brutal finality of such a statement as ""nevermore"" 
 lenore has gone she has departed from this life and is permanently out of the reach of the man the raven represents the solidarity of this despite how much he longs for the impossible despite how much he hopes for something that could never occur he still has that inclination that the fantastical could happen: he has to believe that she could come back and the raven represents the voice of reason the voice of actuality and it kills him it is pain despair melancholy and a spiritual death all rolled into one haunting feathery package 
 he rebels against this voice of rationality he knows the voice speaks the truth but he cannot simply accept it he has lost something vital; he has lost part of himself that will never grace his presence again and he clings to hope a false hope such as it is the raven smashes this to oblivion; it destroys any last semblance of the miraculous occurring it makes the man realise that this is life not some whimsical world where nothing bad ever happens people die people we love die nothing can change that lenore will never walk through his chamber door again and the reality drives him into madness it shatters his life 
 ""and the raven never flitting still is sitting still is sitting 
 on the pallid bust of pallas just above my chamber door; 
 and his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming 
 and the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor; 
 and my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor 
 shall be lifted- nevermore"" 
 his soul will never lift anymore; hope shall never be lifted anymore by the end of the poem he has full realised the reality of the situation the raven the dark bird of harsh truth the harbinger of the words he simply doesn't want to hear has become demonised it has become the very object he did not want to face; he created a sense of longing to protect himself from the emotional loss of lenore and this bubble of falsehood has been burst reality sets in and it is a fate worse than death it is one of persecution and mental chaos as the bird is simply unable to supply the man with all his answers he is driven mad by the unknown 
 the man in the poem has lost ""lenore"" but what is this lenore is she a woman is she this man's lost love or is she something much much more i think on the surface level of the poem she is his dead wife but the archaic references speak of something else lenore could perhaps be a universal suggestion of a lost sense of self or even humanity we are no longer what we once were it is also rather significant that the man is persecuted only by the natural world very much in the romanticism vein man stands aside from nature he has become something different with his modernisation and industrialisation 
 he walks outside his nature and poe being an anti-transcendentalism thinker (a dark romantic) demonstrates that life isn't all sunshine and roses and nor could it ever be it is pessimism in full force and although i strongly disagree with the outlook on life and appreciate the idealistic utopia offered in the poetry of percy shelley and other romantics much more i do love the dark beauty of this poem the finality of the phrase ""nevermore"" is nothing short of maddening reality for our lost man it is the end of hope 
 ligeia 
 if a mind has found the most true and profound bliss what happens when it's taken away 
 well the simple answer is it doesn't work anymore at least not very well the narrator of this marvellous short story experiences a whole host of emotions and mental states after his loss firstly he is hit with the expected wave of melancholy fuelled by his understandable grief; secondly he feels the slow calm breeze of acceptance; thirdly and finaly he is savaged by an unrealised state of delusion and fantasy in this edgar allan poe demonstrates his true mastery of writing a character in different states of mental stability needless to say he's a remarkable writer 
 in beauty of face no maiden ever equaled her it was the radiance of an opium-dream - and airy and spirit-lifting vision more wildly divine than the phantasies which hovered about the slumbering souls of the daughters of delos yet her features were not of that regular mould which we have been falsely taught to worship in the classical labors of the heathen"" 
 the narrator cannot be blamed for his fragility he has lost his world: he has lost his beloved ligeia she was everything to him and they both knew it nothing could lessen the blow of her death; nothing could take the pain away of her upcoming demise: nothing could save his mind in a world without her they were living in harmony; their souls had achieved happiness and love; they were two lesser beings of one greater soul: they were at peace in their own transcendental plane until she died so the narrator's sense of self awareness and actuality has been destroyed he is left with the tatters of a wonderful experience and his own delusion 
 i recommend looking at the following quote and considering exactly who is speaking and why he would conjure up such an image perhaps he didn't fantasise this maybe this is paranormal i do love the multiplicity of its interpretation 
 this short story is a marvel it appears confusing and contradictory but if you stop and consider who is actually speaking then its true nature is revealed admittedly on my first read i was a little lost though after a second read i began to see it for what it was this is not as approachable as some of poe's other works and it really isn't an advisable starting point for the author but the short story is wonderful truly wonderful it highlights the working of the mind in a state of sheer depravity; it is disturbing and brilliant 
 postscript 
 it seems to me that the more popular stories were the more effective ones the only one with little renown that was brilliant was ligeia i'm glad i read the entire thing but some of the works were entirely forgettable there two though will be works i certainly will be reading again in the future absolute nonsense which is to be expected with carroll i love how his writing brings me back to being a kid again obviously loved it on the battlefield of goodreads the mighty reviewer arjuna picked up his trusty pen gandeeva and addressed his charioteer (who was none other than lord krishna): 
 - o kesava take me to the middle of the battlefield between the opposing armies of authors and reviewers so that i may see who i am fighting against 
 and krishna did so 
 but arjuna seeing all his favourite authors arrayed against him was suddenly loath to fight - o krishna he said how will i use my cruel pen to tear into these dear ones how will i lay bare their plots deconstruct their sentences and take their grammar apart no i do not want the glory and likes obtained by such a heinous act better a brain-death reading trash than such sin and he threw his pen down 
 krishna smiled and stood up 
 - o partha such faintheartedness is not worthy of a warrior like you do you think that you destroy books through your reviews banish such foolishness from your mind 
 those reviewers who think that they are destroying books and those authors who believe their books are getting destroyed through reviews both are equally mistaken: for books are neither created nor destroyed through reviews 
 for the book which is published oblivion is certain: and for that which goes out of print rebirth is certain but the story never dies: like human beings change worn clothes it only changes publishers and dust jackets 
 the narrative cannot be destroyed by weapons: it cannot be burnt by fire (read fahrenheit 451) it is not drowned in water it is eternal 
 so your karma o kaunteya is to do the review without worrying about its fruits do not think of the likes you are going to get: do not worry whether the author is going to find you out and conk you on the head: do not trouble your mind about whether people will be put off from reading the book because of your review go into it without attachment: this is the way of the kshatriya this is ""nishkama-karma"" the way to eternal glory 
 hearing this arjuna was heartened he picked up his pen and started to review with renewed vigour 
 review inspired by manny i disagree with greg 
 when i was thirteen i had a journal and i would lie on my tummy and kick my feet in the air and record my tiny thoughts 
 when i was fifteen i had a journal and i would smoke a joint and lie on my tummy and record my huge earthshattering thoughts 
 when i was nineteen i had a journal and - well let's save something for the biopic shall we 
 i don't have a journal anymore and you know why 
 because i write huge purple monsters of sentences and only end up making myself small and shy when i come across them years later 
 this book suffers from many of these sentences 
 i should have known from the first page: 
 i am standing on a corner in monterey waiting for the bus to come in and all the muscles of my will are holding my terror to face the moment i most desire 
 ugh i can feel raymond carver hurling an empty bottle of booze at this sentence in disgust and for once i am with him 
 there is a way to be evocative and complicated and beautiful all at once ""the smile on your face was the deadest thing alive enough to have the strength to die"" anyone 
 this this ain't that and as an opening sentence it just stuck in my craw and tainted the rest of the book 
 i like crisp prose clean lines smart phrasings this seemed too self-indulgent - too emotionally bloatedtoo much ""why use one word when you can use ten and still say nothing"" going on 
 not god but bats and a spider who is weaving my guilt keep the rendezvous with me and shame copulates with every september housefly my room echoes with the screams she never uttered and under my floor the vines of remorse get ready to push up through the damp the cricket drips remembrance unceasingly into my ear lest i mislay any items of cruelty's fiendish inventory 
 oh yeah is that what shame does it copulates with houseflies does it gosh i hope the maggot gets shame's eyesi have no patience for this sort of thing 
 fear will be a terrible fox at my vitals under my tunic of behaviour 
 i say no thank you 
 brigid brophy's introduction is excellent i read it last of course and it made me appreciate the book so much more in retrospect and it also reminded me of the several parts i did enjoy but i have to give it two stars because i really didn't enjoy reading it there were moments of great beauty but too many parts where i was just gagging on her prose i am all for pain and howling emotionsbut isn't it the responsibility of the writer to marry the vulnerable raw nerves with craft it is true there were many moments where i was totally on-board with her writing but when it was bad it was very very bad 
 and oh what's this 
 someone has come to interrupt my ravingsit's me - a week later 
 okay so i have been really sad for a couple of days now and i have reread great swathes of this book under the influence of my own ragged emotionsand i am ashamed to admit that i like it more now i have to keep the two-stars for that is how i felt when i really read it but might i suggest reading this when you are in the throes of some sort of emotional tidal wave it was not meant for happy eyes although there still isn't any shame copulating with any houseflies here at my place fy msr t'khdh mn dm lsh`b thmn nfq hkmh

 mn 'jl bq lry'ys fy lslt@ dante's inferno - the first book i was assigned to read in my high school world literature class back then i couldn't get over how much the emotion of fear set the tone as i read each page i recently revisited this classic rather than a more conventional review - after all there really is nothing i can add as a way of critical commentary -- as a tribute to the great poet i would like to share the below microfiction i wrote a number of years ago: 
 joyride 
 one balmy july evening at a seaside amusement park hector and his date strolled past the merry-go-round toddlers' swings and tooting fire engine out to the more hair-raising rides at the very end of the pier beyond the wild mouse and giant ferris wheel there was a new roller coaster that looked pretty frightening not only did the tracks have steep climbs and amazing plunges but there was an opening in the boardwalk where the roller coaster took its passengers under the pier 
 ""look"" hector said pointing to the hole in the boardwalk ""i've never seen a roller coaster whose tracks go beneath the surface"" 
 ""oh"" his date squealed eager for as much of a thrill as the amusements had to offer ""that must really be scary let's go"" 
 they took their place in line behind the last thrill-seeker and watched as the roller coaster ascended hurled down and sped around hairpin turns finally climbing the highest hump of track and descending to where the track ran beneath the pier hector looked over at the spot in the boardwalk from which the train would eventually reemerge he waited and waited this was taking much more time than he though 
 hector's girlfriend squeezed his hand ""wow i bet they're really getting spooked down there"" 
 hector heard shrieks coming from some place underneath their feet - shrieks not of delight or pleasure but shrieks to make your blood run cold 
 ""oh i can't wait"" his date said tugging at his shirtsleeve 
 hector crouched down to hear the shrieks and howls more clearly waves of heat rising from the spaces between the wooden boards of the boardwalk burned his face after several uneasy moments he stood back up and watched as the roller coaster finally rolled through the cavernous opening in the boardwalk and stopped near the line 
 all of the passengers' faces were ashen and a middle-aged woman in the front seat was weeping on her husband's shoulder 
 ""this must really be something"" hector's date said 
 one terrified passenger unbuckled herself and climbed out she walked past eyes downcast and hector could both see and smell her hair was singed 
 and if this wasn't enough the cheerless bearded man running the ride collected everyone's tickets and pronounced lots would be drawn to determine who would have to ride in the first car hector's date called out that if nobody else wanted she would gladly volunteer for the front seat 
 when the old man nodded she pulled hector by the hand to the front of the roller coaster and strapped him in next to her hector noticed for the first time the name of this ride - spelled out in red iridescent letters over their heads was ""dante's inferno"" 
 hector slunk down in his seat next to his girlfriend who was now giggling and playfully poking him in the ribs as the roller coaster began moving hector tried to console himself with the grim fact that everyone on the preceding ride did at least come back alive i'm not a huge poetry person but i just had to buy this book after hearing so many people talking about it it didn't disappoint in anyway the poetry in this book is so raw and beautiful that i related to so many that i kept going back to reread my favorites and highlight and tab them outstanding collection of poems so much soul so much intelligence in how parker folds in cultural references and the experiences of black womanhood every poem will get its hooks into you and of course the poems about beyonce are the greatest because beyonce is our queen pablo picasso spent his entire life trying desperately to do something new something unique he moved from style to style mastering and then abandoning both modern and classical methods even trying to teach his trained artist's hand to paint like a child 
 in 1940 four french teens and a dog stumbled upon a cave that had lain hidden for 16000 years inside they found the walls covered in beautiful drawings of men and animals when the lascaux caves were opened to the public pablo picasso visited them and as he stared at the prehistoric hunting scenes was heard to remark in a despondent tone: ""we have invented nothing"" 
 the iliad is equally as humbling to a writer as complex beautiful and honest as any other work the war scenes play out like a modern film gory and fast-paced the ever-present shock of death though some have been annoyed at how each man is named (or even given a past) before his death this gives weight to the action each death is has consequence and as each man steps onto the stage to meet glory or death homer gives us a moment to recognize him to see him amidst the whirling action and to witness the fate zeus metes 
 the psychological complexity and humanism of this work often shocked me homer's depiction of human beings as fundamentally flawed and unable to direct their own lives predicts existentialism the even hand he gives both the trojans and the argives places his work above the later moralizing allegories of turold tasso or even milton 
 of course homer's is a different world than theirs one where the sword has not yet become a symbol for righteousness in homer good men die unavenged and bad men make their way up in the world noble empires fall to ravenous fire and the corpses of fresh-limbed young men are desecrated 
 fate does not favor the kind the weak the moral or even the strong fate favors some men now others later and in the end none escapes the emptiness of death though homer paints some men as great as noble and kind and brave these men do not uphold these ideals for some promised paradise but simply because they are such men 
 there is something refreshing in the purity of the philosophy of living life for yourself and yet expecting no entitlement for your deeds a philosophy which accepts the uncontrollable winds of fate; that when the dark mist comes across our eyes no man knows whence he goes 
 later traditions make other claims: that the righteous will be rewarded that the lives of good men will be good and the bad will be punished in thousands of years of thinking of writing of acting have we gained nothing but comforting untenable ideals then picasso was wrong we have invented something but it is only a machine which perpetuates itself by peddling self-satisfaction 
 i read and enjoyed the fagles translation which may not be the most faithful but strikes that oft-discussed balance between joy of reading and fidelity he makes no attempt to translate the meter into english which is a blessing to us the english language does a few meters well and homer's is not one of them 
 the footnotes were competent and interesting though i could have stood a few more of them; perhaps i am in the minority i also thoroughly enjoyed knox's introductory essay i would normally have had to research the scholarly history of the book myself and so knox's catch-me-up was much appreciated '`tqd 'nh stkwn 'rw` shy' qr'th ws'qr'h `n l'nsny@ wlhb wl`t wlhkm@

 outstanding book so why did the ancient mariner shoot the albatross 
 to me the answer is simple he did it because he could; he did it because is he is a man and that's what men do: he saw something beautiful; he saw perfection in nature and he killed it that's humanity for you sinning is easily as quickly as a finger click: it happens just like that there's little thought involved for the mariner it is spontaneity itself; it's in his nature to destroy the shooting of the bird suggests that all sin is the same; it's so very easy to be evil in the face of opportunity 
 ""and i had done a hellish thing 
 and it would work 'em woe: 
 for all averred i had killed the bird 
 that made the breeze to blow 
 ah wretch said they the bird to slay 
 that made the breeze to blow"" 
 the bird is suggestive of a christian soul; the mariner shoots in regardless he doesn't care remorse comes later but can it be called true remorse it is only born out of regret because of the dire situation he is placed in because of his wanton act is this remorse or self-pity is he merely regretful because he wishes to be saved the other sailors hang the bird round his neck to represent a cross to show that they had no part in the deed but they didn't care before; they had a pack mentality to kill so mercilessly was a joke; it was fun to be in a position of power however when the scales are turned they realise the error of their ways is empathy that hard to develop do they have to be in a dire situation to understand brutality 
 ""ah well a-day what evil looks 
 had i from old and young 
 instead of the cross the albatross 
 about my neck was hung"" 
 before the shooting of the bird the world is a wonder the ice is picturesque; it is sea is green like an emerald and the sun is fantastic with the albatross came the wind and the mist afterwards the sea becomes silent the water turns to oil and the sun is bloody and vengeful nature recognises the crime; it reacts in turn and attacks humanity in its anger the supernatural occurs and the power of coleridge's romantic imagination is felt the wonder of the poem is the many allegories it holds it can be read in many different each of which is valid 
 the one that i hear when i read is the one that suggests of a spiritual salvation no matter what the symbolic nature of the mariner's crime suggests he is still redeemable humanity is still redeemable not all is lost there is still hope for the spontaneous and the thoughtless: 
 ""the selfmoment i could pray; 
 and from my neck so free 
 the albatross fell off and sank 
 like lead into the sea"" 
 it may be self-deceiving and it may be just to save his own skin but i'd like to think the mariner is genuine i'd like to think he realises the futility of his actions and comes around i'd like think his morale transformation is real and he isn't just doing it to continue his existence but who knows this poem is dense and conflicting but it's easily coleridge's best work in the second season of madmen don draper awash in the chaos of his own identity recites these lines from ""mayakovsky"" the last poem in this book: 
 now i am quietly waiting for 
 the catastrophe of my personality 
 to seem beautiful again 
 and interesting and modern 
 frank o'hara's poetry does not have to wait--quietly or otherwise it is always beautiful and interesting and sixty years later it still seems modern too 
 most 20th century verse lovers if asked what midcentury poet inherited the legacy of whitman would pick allen ginsberg the iconic embodiment of the beats but my vote goes to the new york school's frank o'hara 
 ginsberg loved whitman adopting both his long lists and his long verse lines and self-consciously donning the whitmanesque mantle of american prophet--half soapbox shouter and half hindu holyman--who celebrates the human body alternative sexuality and the teeming variety of the american street but in spite of his guru-style blessings and his hipster humor ginsberg's poems are still pervaded by an ancient--albeit syncopated--hebrew melancholy as if the prophet jeremiah had copped a gig with a cool jazz band 
 frank o'hara on the other hand writes verse suffused with optimism he celebrates the same things ginsberg does but unlike ginsberg--and like whitman--he immerses himself in every moment in every detail joyously relishing the opportunities for pure sensation and passionate friendship that new york has to offer (i suspect that handed a prophet's cloak frank would have simply collapsed helpless with laughter) 
 o'hara raised in massachusetts and educated as a catholic (a church he describes in one of his poems as ""at best an over-solemn introduction to cosmic entertainment"") worked as a navy sonar technician during ww ii went to harvard on the gi bill and eventually sought his fortune in new york city he got a job at moma--first selling postcards in the gift shop later as a curator of painting--and threw himelf into the social whirl of the nyc art scene 
 a devoted friend and prolific lover he introduced poets to painters (and vice versa) reveling in personal and artistic freedom o'hara may have died three years before the stonewall riots (a poet's death: run over by a car on fire island where no cars are allowed) but he lived in a small liberated enclave well ahead of its time and his love for his world and his love for new york city shines in every line he wrote 
 although this 1957 collection is the one most of his contemporaries knew him by it came before his chattier more colloquial ""personism"" period before donald allen's revolutionary anthology the new american poets (1960) proclaimed him as a leader of the new york school and before his small city lights book lunch poems (1964) was published a book which contains many of his best known pieces 
 nevertheless this earlier volume shows o'hara to good advantage its poems possess the characteristic o'hara virtues--the conversational tone the manic enthusiasm the gentle humor the name-dropping--but since the inspiration here is more rimbaud than mayakovsky these poems are grandly often bafflingly surrealist unlike much surrealist poetry however these pieces show a painter's respect for form: each outrageous improvisation is placed artfully upon the canvas of the individual poem rilke (1875-1926) was a famous german poet born in prague he traveled widely throughout europe married and had a daughter a dozen years out of school after rilke had achieved some fame as a poet a young man wrote to him asking for advice about life and poetry rilke wrote ten letters to him over five years the young boy was romantic frail and dreamy; a prisoner so to speak in a military boarding school where he was subject to strict discipline bullying and humiliation it was the same school that rilke's father sent him to in preparation for a career as a military officer and all those adjectives also applied to rilke who had been in the identical situation so in a sense rilke poured his heart out writing to his younger self 
 some of rilke's writings in the ten letters: 
 ""for the creative artist there is no poverty - nothing is insignificant or unimportant"" 
 ""there is nothing that manages to influence a work of art less than critical words they always result in more or less unfortunate misunderstandings things are not as easily understood nor as expressible as people usually would like us to believe most happenings are beyond expression; they exist where a word has never intruded"" 
 writing in 1904 rilke was amazingly prescient about the upcoming sexual revolution: 
 ""perhaps the sexes are more closely related than one would think perhaps the great renewal of the world will consist of this that man and woman freed of all confused feelings and desires shall no longer seek each other as opposites but simply as members of a family and neighbors and will unite as human beings in order to simply earnestly patiently and jointly bear the heavy responsibility of sexuality that has been entrusted to themthis progress shall transform the experience of love presently full of error opposed at first by men who have been overtaken in their progress by women it shall thoroughly change the love experience to the rebuilding of a relationship meant to be between two persons no longer just between man and womanthe men who today cannot yet feel it coming shall be surprised and defeated by it"" 
 ""do not allow yourself to be confused in your aloneness by the something within you that wishes to be released from it this very wish if you will calmly and deliberately use it as a tool will help to expand your solitude into far distant realms"" 
 ""everything you can think about in your childhood is good"" 
 ""of all my books there are only a few that are indispensable to me two of them are constantly at my fingertips wherever i may be they are here with me now: the bible and the books of the great danish writer jens peter jacobsen"" (rilke particularly praises jacobsen's collection of short stories mogens which i have reviewed here: https://wwwgoodreadscom/review/show) 
 ""we are unutterably alone essentially especially in the things most intimate and most important to usit becomes increasingly clear that it [aloneness] is basically not something we can choose to have or not to have we simply are alone one can only delude one's self and act as though it were not so - that is all"" 
 the second half of the book is a collection of some of his poems most are very accessible here are some sections of verse that i liked 
 from for a friend 
 i have my dead and i would let them go 
 and be surprised to see them all so cheerful 
 so soon at home in being-dead so right 
 so unlike their repute you you alone 
 return; brush past me move about persist 
 in knocking something that vibratingly 
 betrays you 
 from orpheus eurydice hermes 
 wrapt in herself she wandered and her deadness 
 was filling her like fullness 
 full as a fruit with sweetness and with darkness 
 was she with her great death which was so new 
 that for the time she could take nothing in 
 from the cathedral 
 in those small towns you come to realize 
 how the cathedrals utterly outgrew 
 their whole environment their birth and rise 
 as our own life's too great proximity 
 will mount beyond our vision and our sense 
 of other happenings took precedence 
 of all things; as though that were history 
 piled up in their immeasurable masses 
 in petrification safe from circumstance 
 from the dwarf's song 
 my hands too will always be failing me 
 how hopelessly stunted they are you can see: 
 damp heavy hopping constrictedly 
 like little toads in wet weather 
 and everything else about me too 
 is old and worn and sad to view; 
 why does god delay to do 
 away with it altogether 
 from the orphan girl's song 
 i'm no one and no one is what i shall be 
 i'm still too small to exist i agree; 
 but i'll always be so 
  
 no one can need me: it's too soon now 
 and tomorrow it's too late

 i recently watched the masterpiece that is moonlight and to say that i was utterly blown away would not be at all an exaggeration it's the kind of movie that sticks with you covering issues of race discrimination sexuality m/m love coming of age and so much more i can't get over how wide-spanning and game-changing this film is to quote this article moonlight also became the first film with an all black cast the first lgbt film and the second lowest-grossing film domestically (behind the hurt locker) to win the academy award for best picture 
 also that ending dev patel and andrew garfield said it best when: 
 i vividly remember thinking during one particular scene in the film i wonder how this was written down in the script so i was beyond ecstatic to get to read the screenplay so soon after seeing the film and as you might've guessed moonlight was just as spectacular on page as it was on the big screen (plus we get extra scenes that didn't make it into the final cute) (and a different - but still similar - ending) 
 i had so many favorite scenes in moonlight - and since the film is divided into three parts it's quite a number - so i'll just start sharing: 
 warning: i get overly excited 
 ""juan 
 you don't talk much but you damn 
 sure can eat 
 teresa smiling 
 teresa 
 that's alright baby you talk when 
 you ready 
 little looking up from his plate at that something about teresa's voice her presence clicking with him 
 little 
 my name chiron 
 (and) 
 but people call me little 
 teresa 
 i'm gon' call you by your name"" 
 this was my favorite introduction scene made me grow appreciative of teresa and juan that more and like the brilliant mahershala ali who plays juan in the film said best about his character: 
 ""juan 
 so how you like swimmin' 
 nothing from little heard him but the words too heavy to present themselves 
 juan 
 that good huh"" 
 i cherished the above scene even more when we had it come back between little and kevin in a later part: 
 ""kevin 
 this dude reminded me of you 
 beat 
 black 
 what'd he play 
 a long pause from kevin the song wedging itself in his thoughts right now pushing everything aside 
 black 
 that good huh"" 
 made a megawatt smile appear on my face 
 ""teresa 
 (playful) 
 think you slick huh do it wrong so teresa show up and do it right 
 huh 
 (laughs) 
 teresa (cont'd) 
 you and juan thick as thieves 
 lemme tell you 
 teresa looking to chiron for that last part what begins as a smile slowly fading shifting to something more reflective heavy 
 teresa 
 you miss him 
 chiron holding her gaze his silence answer enough 
 teresa 
 yeah 
 me too 
 beat 
 teresa 
 me too"" 
 i was devastated when i found out about juan 
 ""kevin 
 hell shit make you wanna cry feel 
 so good 
 chiron looking to kevin now: 
 chiron 
 you cry 
 kevin 
 nah but it make me want to 
 kevin flashing that big cool ass smile 
 kevin 
 what you cry about you cry chiron 
 beat 
 chiron 
 i cry so much sometimes i think one 
 day i'm gone just turn into drops"" 
 that last line impacted me so much that i wrote it down the minute i heard it in the film 
 last but not least i'm sharing one of the most iconic exchange between two romantically involved characters: 
 ""black 
 you're the only man who's ever 
 touched me 
 the air going out of kevin's chest his gaze fixated on black's lips anticipating the words falling from there: 
 black 
 the only one 
 black's hand is flat atop the table between them his eyes lower to it: 
 black 
 i haven't really touched anyone 
 since"" 
 this remains one of the most lively lines ever 
 reading the screenplay set me up in this continues loop of reading and then rewatching and then rereading and watching again help 
 and since there are so many more scenes i want to share i was thankful to find this post that sums them up pretty greatly: 
 real talk moonlight has my whole heart in the palm of its fictional hands this film deserves every award and recognition it'll receive in the near future and i hope it collects a whole lot 
 ps i love this screenplay even more for opening up my world to the fact that i can read the screenplays of my favorite films

 this review and more can be found on my blog there is literally a whole monologue in which a guy complains about his dog pissing on everything 2pac has brought me out of my reading slump when in doubt turn to pac 
 most people think of him first and foremost as a rapper but that's only one side of his story 
 first of all let me start off by saying that i'm not the biggest expert on rap i do enjoy it though if there's one thing i pride myself on it's my constant drive to learn new things and broaden horizons i am interested in everything i appreciate all forms of music rock grunge alternative pop blues classical most of the songs i listen to are in different languages (english spanish german italian) the one genre i avoided however was rap then i saw vanilla ice and was like what have i been doing with my life for real straight outta croatia 
 *gets loudly booed* 
 i jest of course eminem is actually the one that got me into it because eminem i thought i'd marry him before that i was convinced i'd marry nick carter don't judge me 
 where was i oh eminem he was/is a genius 
 but then i heard this guy 
 2pac is the greatest sorry em 
 rap has been looked down on since its inception it's not hard to see why the lyrics are often violent and disrespectful to both the authority and the women like many rappers 2pac was considered a thug indeed he's made a lot of mistakes i will not try to justify his behavior i always got the sense that he was torn between his public life as a gangster rapper and his private life as a serious poet he liked to read shakespeare and machiavelli he took ballet classes he appreciated pop music and let's not forget his meaningful lyrics 
 when i was young me and my mama had beef 
 17 years old kicked out on the streets 
 though back at the time i never thought i'd see her face 
 ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place 
 & 
 and since we all came from a woman 
 got our name from a woman and our game from a woman 
 i wonder why we take from our women 
 why we rape our women do we hate our women 
 i think it's time to kill for our women 
 time to heal our women be real to our women 
 and if we don't we'll have a race of babies 
 that will hate the ladies that make the babies 
 and since a man can't make one 
 he has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one 
 so will the real men get up 
 i know you're fed up ladies but keep your head up 
 & 
 i see no changes all i see is racist faces 
 misplaced hate makes disgrace to races 
 we under i wonder what it takes to make this 
 one better place let's erase the wasted 
 take the evil out the people they'll be acting right 
 that's some deep shi- stuff pac was a deeply complex person maybe i'm being overly dramatic i love to romanticize people i always do that anyway this is a great collection of poems highly recommended for everyone 
 ps if you haven't yet make sure to check out the amazing tupac: resurrection documentary i have never loved a collection of poetry more in my entire life here be spoilers 
 this could all have been avoided if hamlet and his posse had sought the counsel of sassy gay friend 
 although hamlet is one of the most important pieces of literature on the planet many find it hard to understand basically this is what happens 
 hamlet is depressed and feeling emo af he's got 99 problems and his dysfunctional family is the biggest one the prince of denmark is not a happy camper 
 he wants to kill his uncle aka the king to avenge his father not a good idea 
 i mean i get it claudius is a big douche he needs to die like a lot but murder is murder come on hamlet you're better than that 
 hamlet is starting to lose his mind he's just walking around saying 'to be or not to be: that is the question' he has zero chill 
 as usual gertrude and her stupidity are of no help here 
 the person i feel most sorry for is ophelia i like her but what was she thinking 
 poor ophelia it's gotta suck when your bf tells you to go to a nunnery and you just gotta sit there and accept it 
 i wanted to shake her and tell her to find a man who will treat her right 
 oh hamlet you poor foolish boy you're an idiot but you're a lovable idiot 
 hamlet is very likely the best thing shakespeare has ever written it's a great read as long as you know what to expect to borrow a quote from game of thrones- if you think this has a happy ending you haven't been paying attention 
 the rest is silence

 klunm `munq lhznun hfra@an fy kynwntkzddt qudrtk `l~ htw farh 'kthr i was quite excited going into this because the promise of short essays original photography and poetry combined into one sounded right up my alley 
 you might recognise connor franta from his popular youtube channel and in this diary-like look at his life since a work in progress connor talks about his battles with clinical depression social anxiety self-love and acceptance; his desire to maintain an authentic self in a world that values shares and likes over true connections; his struggles with love and loss; and his renewed efforts to be in the moment--with others and himself 
 ""our words our firsthand experiences our shared truths can form ladders and bring hope to others"" 
 however good the above might sound in the end it didn't live up and i was disappointed to find franta's writing style coming across as quite hollow and privileged also his weird ""i'm a special snow flake"" complex rubbed me the wrong way multiple times: 
 ""i've never been a big fan of attending awards shows most are pretentious and few are truly entertaining in theory it sounds fun to witness the glamour and chaos of the red carpet firsthand but the truth is that once you're done up looking fine and immersed in such superficial gatherings    it's not all that the novelty soon wears thin 
 i don't know maybe that's just me"" 
 i couldn't help but think of this hilarious tweet about artsy white boys(tm) 
 then the genericness of franta's thoughts and feelings didn't help his case either there wasn't anything compelling enough for me to continue on where the writing's considered so i did skim-read a lot towards the end and another thing i want to point out: the atmosphere it just felt so cold and standoffish with a lot of telling with little to no showing i mean: ""this fucking sucks i'll repeat that until you believe it: this fucking sucks"" 
 here's an idea: how about you show me why it fucking sucks instead of repeating it for emphasis 
 to be frank note to self felt a lot more fitting for the blog post format than something you'd expect to read in a book which leads me to the pretentious tumblr-esque poems interspersed throughout: 
 there's a lot more where that came from i'm genuinely rattled that this made it into the final version of the book 
 however to end this review on a much brighter note i have to mention the vibrant photographs not going to lie they were the only reason i continued on with this book but i quickly noticed that - save for a few - the pictures weren't as eye-catching as i'd hoped (you can just go on connor franta's instagram for the same effect) 
 but still here are a few of my favorite photos to brighten this ending a bit:

 this review and more can be found on my blog why is it that i love the universe of this ""dark"" comedy so much and why does it strike me as not really being so ""dark"" after all could it be because it is presided over by a ""god""--the young duke--who is priggish diffident and comically vain (when his reputation is attacked by lucio) and yet is unfailingly just and honorably susceptible to the attractions of female goodness and beauty is it because the ""villain""--angelo--is so pathetic and small that one never seriously expects he will win or is it because this world is--in spite of all its lust and hypocrisy--an absurd surprisingly malleable universe in which even a base rogue like barnadine can simply refuse to be executed and then be allowed to survive 
 all of these contribute to my great love for the play but above all i admire the character of isabella who is virtuous and brave and filled with mercy even for the vile hypocrite who wronged her she leaves me with the feeling that--grubby and fallen though it may be--this is a world worth living for a drama written in verse about three british boys who join up the army and are sent to afghanistan that explores the aftermath of warfare and the effect on those who they left behind the poetry part was a little hit and miss for me but most of the rhythm was really good and the imagery was really good especially in the one verse that gave the book its name where lisa is talking about taff's time in the war lisa had some pretty good lines in general the subject matter felt exaggerate when reading but i kept in mind that the whole point of this is that it's supposed to be performed and i do think that it was good and it would be even better if you get to see it actually being performed especially because hearing poetry is so different from the act of just reading it oh my pretty you compelled me 
 i had no clue poems could be so exquisite what a reading experience some are mystically poignant and can leave you holding tightly to something anything 
 they can also steal your breath away is what i discovered it is not that i had never read a poem in my life but i had never found myself doing it for my own pleasure and at the same time realizing how they could truly affect me 
 what i fool was i to ignore all those collections of poems i strongly heard of before this precious book felt like a wake up call to me lola stories as you define them are not the only ones that a book can contain poems for once are more discreet but you have to reach out for them and then you'll see what extraordinary content they may retain 
 some of the poems inside this are not what you would maybe qualify as 'beautiful' but perhaps more as honest ones are also very peculiar or abstract and requiring a second third forth read but would they be as interesting as they are if everything were clear and obvious from the beginning i loved how they made me think and left me analyzing 
 my own favourites between the fifty ones written are: 
 sleeping beauty's wedding day 
  
 a brief history of feminism 
  
 vindictive punctuation 
 (what an original one) 
 the little mermaid 
  
 nature lesson 
 and 
 view from the balcony 
  
 what i did find lacking though is the 'fairytale' atmosphere i caught it in multiple poems but many don't possess it and that is unfortunate because it cold have embellished them even more especially the 'contemporary' ones 
 i had read works including feminism as theme before but never as present and subjected to obvious opinions as it was in this although that is such an important belief and movement in support of women's rights and equality to me so i will look forward to reading more of it 
 unsurprisingly i am more than recommending this read even if as i was you may not be sure that you might enjoy it it could be that you find yourself suddenly gasping for more in the end as i felt perhaps that will not happen but i still think it is worth trying and finally if you have recommendations for me please feel free to share them in the comments happy reading you cannot prevent the birds of sorrow from flying over your head but you can prevent them from building a nest in your hair 
 - chinese proverb 
 i picked this up because the title struck me like a poem in itself sounding like an titillating modulation on that wonderful poem hope is the thing with feathers by emily dickinson i am intrigued by the technique of altering variations on a theme like in music and keen on searching for changes in harmony rhythm melody or orchestration  a glance on the explicit cover art however leaves no room for dulcet misunderstanding: the 'thing with feathers' isn't a tender still-downy birdie but a lugubrious black bird - it is ted hughes's sinister crow resuscitated in this fable-like tale about coping with the sudden death of a spouse and mother 
 do we find books or do books find us having experienced the death of a spouse twice - a brutal sudden one and one following a long illness going through a childless mourning and one together with two children now this novella focussing on the grieving process of a father and his 2 young sons came to find me strange enough both times ted hughes (1930-1998) crossed my path the first time with birthday letters  published a few months after my first spouse's death and now again with max porter's novella exuding ted hughes from every pore 
 while the father tries to continue working after the death of his wife writing a book about ted hughes 's crow 'crow on the couch a wild analysis' crow enters promising (or threatening) to stay as long as the father and the 2 young boys need him the crow character associated with numerous myths about death and dying like the raven symbolizing death itself in some cultures curiously brings life instead of death epitomizing grief and sadness as an incontrovertible part of life he claims to be a sentimental bird thriving on sorrow eating it as grief is raw dirty scary and exhausting - certainly rather a crow than a sweet little bird of hope - the image of the omnipresent crow embodying grief is excellent and powerful but it is hughes's creature after all not porter's to determine whether both crowish characters are idiosyncratic or not the original crow poetry should be read which i didn't porter's winged friend rings true to its archetypical crowish nature: vibrant intelligent playful a mythical trickster 
 porter in general escapes wallowing in sentimentality showing the raw and messy face of grief observing astutely the pulverised lives of a family in mourning a family who does not simply 'move on' but anyway has no choice then to live on floundering through life's trivialities of eating cleaning banking working inevitably depending on one's own life experiences with loss and its connected sensibilities the reader can expect some fragments to tear on a reader's heartstrings when facing the physical and emotional void left by the beloved: 
 she won't ever use (make-up turmeric hairbrush thesaurus) she won't ever finish (patricia highsmith novel peanut butter lip balm) 
 there were flashes of insight and recognition the silent witnesses of what once was a life flying shrapnels in the house the piercing pain a little note can provoke the gentle instigation of good friends to pick up life again the sudden single-parenting issues ""moving on as a concept is for stupid people because any sensible person knows grief is a long-term project i refuse to rush the pain that is thrust upon us let no man slow or speed or fix"" true but also a truism 
 porter piqued my curiosity about hughes's original crow poetry and about some of the other british poets featuring in his debut novel probably worth exploring his own creation fell flat in getting me into the hearts and minds of the grieving family apart from a few moving passages like the moment the father frees her ashes: 
 up they went the sense of a cloud the failure of clouds scientifically quick and visually hopeless a murder of little burnt birds flecked against the grey sky the grey sea the white sun and gone 
 alternatingly listening to the voices of the father the boys and crow the irking voice of crow irritated me at first having read the novella a second time now the wordplay and onomatopoeia keep striking me as rather childish and hollow - dissonant cawing futile twaddle in the dutch translation i read the ostensible poetry in his lines resembles what we call in dutch 'karamellenverzen'(toffee verses) namedropping poets or writing about poetry does not turn a tale into a prose poem in itself 
 perhaps aspiring to depict how grief loses its bleak sharpness through the passing of time making place for a milder cherishing of precious memories without ever entirely vanishing or healing porter's fable premise and magic realism might not fully convey authenticity but should be honoured as an honest attempt to word the ineffable 
 on a si peur des souvenirs 
 les oublier c'est un peu mourir 
 (jo lemaire la memoire en exil) it's impossible not to smile when you start reading such a classic and after only the first few pages you realize and completely understand why it's regarded as one of the most important works in literature i'm always a little anxious when i tackle such important and renowned books for being afraid of not comprehending or loving them - war and peace and don quixote for example - as they seem to deserve not that i'm obligated to like them but i always feel such buzz comes for a reason and i try to at least find out why with the odyssey once again i find that the ones who have read it before me were right: it's amazing 
 i didn't have plans to read the odyssey any time soon - i've never devoted much time to epic poems and this one has more than 12000 verses - but because i've been eying ulysses on my shelves for quite some time i decided to prepare myself for it and read about odysseus with a great group here on goodreads to call homer's book simply ""a preparation"" for joyce's work is now not only unfair but also absurd to me however i'm glad that i finally read it whatever the reason behind it was 
 the odyssey tells the story of odysseus's (ulysses) journey back to his home ithaca to return to his wife penelope and son telemachus after twenty years of absence our hero left his home to fight in the trojan war - that alone lasted ten years - and encountered too many obstacles that kept him away for another ten years back in ithaca people had already lost hope that he could still be alive and his wife was being courted by suitors who wanted to marry her 
 alongside the emotional and heartfelt story what grabbed my attention here was the poem's style and structure for a work that's believed to have been written in the 8th century bc its quality and refinement certainly amazed me some of the story is told through flashbacks some of it is told through different narrators and its narratives are non-linear so i was positively surprised 
 i could try to write an analysis about the recurring themes on the book - vengeance spiritual growth hospitality - or try to decipher its symbolism - much has been written about odysseus's bow laertes's shroud the sea - but i feel i would fail and wouldn't be able to do it in a deep level especially after having read the great introduction and notes written by bernard knox 
 what kept me away from homer's work was the fear that it would be too dense and heavy on mythology - it is mythological of course - making it hard for me to understand it although labored the narrative is quite simple and easy to follow knox's notes were a great companion to fill in the details i needed to comprehend the book in a deeper level 
 rating: it's my belief that a great book not only satisfy your expectations but also inspire you to delve further into its writer's other works similar subjects or even other books from the same time period the odyssey raised my interest about greek mythology and the iliad so i guess it served its purpose with high colors because of that 5 glowing and beautiful stars bysw hw dhlk ldhy j ly`br `ny 'khyr

 'n dgty rtf` wjly lskr ever since i first read homer's epic describing the adventures of odysseus back in my school days three of those adventures fired my imagination: the lotus eaters the cyclops and the sirens most especially the sirens i just did revisit these sections of this greek epic and my imagination was set aflame yet again how much you ask here is my microfiction as a tribute to the great poet: 
 the sirens 
 this happened back in those days when i was a member of an experimental performing-arts troupe down in greenwich village we would read poetry dance and act out avant-garde plays in our dilapidated little theater for a modest charge people could come in and watch for as long as they wanted 
 somehow a business executive who worked downtown in the financial district heard of what we were doing and spoke with our director about an act he has all worked out but needed a supporting cast and that he would pay handsomely if we went along with him 
 well experimental is experimental and if we were going to be well paid we had nothing to lose the first thing he did was pass out our costumes in addition to himself he had parts for three men and three women the play we were to perform was so simple we didn't even need a written script he was to be odysseus from homer's epic and three men would be his sailors as for the women we would be the singing sirens 
 so after he changed - quite a sight in a loincloth being gray-haired jowly pasty-skinned and potbellied - we went on stage and he told the sailors how no man has ever heard the hypnotic songs of the sirens and lived to tell the tale but he mighty odysseus would be the first he instructed the sailors to tie him to the ship's mast they used one of the building's pillars and when he cried out as the sirens sang their song the sailors who had wax in their ears were to bind him to the mast even tighter 
 meanwhile three of us ladies were on stage as the sirens in costume bare-breasted and outfitted with wings we began singing a sweet lilting melody mike - that was the businessman's name - started screaming and the sailors tightened the ropes that bound him the sailors were glad their ears were plugged as mike screamed for nearly half an hour 
 when the ship passed out of earshot of the sirens the sailors unbound mighty odysseus and he collapsed on our makeshift stage a mass of exhausted middle-aged flesh the audience applauded even cheered and we continued our performance of odysseus and the sirens every night for more than a week then one night mike outdid himself his blue eyes bulged the veins in his neck popped and his face turned a deeper blood-scarlet than ever before and what i feared might happen did happen - mike had a heart attack we had to interrupt our performance and call an ambulance 
 we all thought that was the end of our dealing with mike aka odysseus until our director received a call from the hospital mike told her he was going to be just fine and would be back on stage next week we called a meeting and everyone agreed that we would suggest mike seek psychiatric help but if he insists on playing odysseus he will have to take his act elsewhere 'thr lfrsh@ l yury 'thr lfrsh@ l yzwl

 i am amazed at how in just a few short words nayyirah can invoke so much emotion 
 i will definitely be reading this again many many times 
 i am going to insert a few of my favorite poems but seriously every single one is a gem 
 i am the line 
 on both sides there are songs 
 in my name 
 -bi 
 i am a black wave 
 in 
 a white sea 
 always seen 
 and 
 unseen 
 -the difference 
 for me 
 there is no other 
 because there is no default 
 everyone 
 is 
 a variation of life 
 -the human being | the human gender | the human sex when confronted with the painful choice of whether or not to read chaucer in the original middle english i agonised for precisely four seconds and decided to read nevill coghill's modern translation in lovely penguin paperback in the same way i wouldn't learn german to read goethe or unlearn english to read dan brown i refuse to learn archaic forms of english for pointless swotty scholar-points and grope instead for selfish readerly pleasure two-fingering the purists and bunking down with mr nevill for nights of sumptuous moral homily proto-feminist romantic comedy and high courtly drama for chaucer neophytes like me this text captures the bouncy humour and devilish cleverness of the original (not that i would know) and hopefully will turn a generation of frightened and unenlightened readers on to this master of verse (and if you must know my rhyming homage review was lost due to a power failure and a more tempting invitation to eat pilaf rice with brian street children wives of bath go forth and chaucerize) after ana commits suicide audery can't stop having panic attacks audery has a secret and the guilt is killing her knowing that a lie she told ended in ana's death at ana's funeral audery meets her boyfriend rad and the two leave the funeral to go somewhere and talk audrey can't help but be attracted to rad and can't stop thinking about him even though she has her own boyfriend the two eventually lose touch only end up running into one another again years down the line audery and rad keep being drawn together but audery doesn't know how she can be with rad after what the did to ana 
 the writing was okay but i didn't really enjoy the plot here i thought the ending was kind of strange and how did they not do an autopsy of ana i thought they did even with suicides especially with the rumors going around about her and her dad  i just couldn't get into the book i thought it was going to be like teenage angst but it wasn't really i didn't feel bad for audrey either like who lies about that i don't care how old you are also when audrey leaves to rediscover herself i was so bored i don't think it was necessary to add that in to the plot it didn't really do anything for her growth she just had another relationship it made the book feel longer than necessary to see this review and others please visit wwwreadrantrockandrollcom 
 this review may contain spoilers 
 i decided to try note to self by connor franta because i had a free audible credit and it sounded like something i would enjoy i appreciate learning about other people and the struggles they've had in life and how they've endured them 
 i went into this book fairly blind and didn't even know who connor franta was my oldest son who's a youtuber did and i can see this book being helpful to older teens and younger adults it's so raw and insightful-i think it would've been helpful to have this book when i was in high school there are so many emotions that we go through at this age and into young adulthood connor lays out his emotions and exposes his experiences in a way that helps you to understand that you're not alone in your thoughts at times it felt like he was pulling some of his thoughts right out of my own head how should we be thinking and how can we deal with these emotions in a non- damaging way to ourselves and others hmm that may take me some more time to figure out 
 connor discusses some of the problems he's had including struggling with his sexuality depression social anxiety loss of relationships and issues he's had with feeling accepted when listening to him talk about his struggle with depression i admire the way he describes his depression as being another person and to be sure to never believe the horrible thoughts that run through your mind be sure to wipe them away- i loved this because it's so true it's something i feel anyone who struggles with depression and anxiety can benefit from-realizing that the emotions and feelings are part of you but don't define you 
 i also enjoyed the part where he discusses how we feel about ourselves if you think you're confident you will be - self perception how many times have you felt unconfident i've had this happen numerous times in my life 
 i did listen to this on audible and was thrilled that the audio-book is read by the author i'm afraid i may have missed some visual content but i do know that there are many positive statements in this book that can benefit those who struggle in life and for those figuring everything out i feel that it can help instill bravery in some ways the writing did feel like it could have been better and maybe didn't feel compelling enough but i still enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone especially older teens who are moving towards adulthood 
 35*** rounded up to 4**** shakespeare's sonnet xviii (abridged) 
 you're hot 
 but not as hot as this poem 
 shakespeare's sonnet cxvi (abridged) 
 i'll love you even when you are sixty four 
 or my name's not heather mills 
 shakespeare's sonnet xciv (abridged) 
 stay cool man peace 
 like flower power y'know can you write a book review 
 entirely in verse 
 omitting standard sentences 
 for stanzas taut and terse 
 it seems a fitting treatment 
 for such a book as this; 
 so humor me i beg you-- 
 and my limited wit 
 emily dickinson was a poet 
 one of the very best; 
 a natural gift with language-- 
 at once daft and deft 
 something of a recluse 
 something of a crank; 
 living closed up in her room-- 
 like a fish in a tank 
 undoubtedly a genius 
 ahead of her time; 
 unappreciated in her life 
 for her erratic rhymes 
 but when she finally passed away 
 her cache of poems was found; 
 edited to the day's tastes-- 
 the dashes taken out 
 the dash--the perfect punctuation 
 for her unique style; 
 jagged--ragged--sudden--striking 
 and also--versatile 
 obsessed with life--and death--and bees 
 most of her poems are short; 
 some of them only one quatrain 
 they end before they start 
 and what entrancing rhythm 
 like the beating of a drum-- 
 her words hammer forward-- 
 marching--stomping--thumping--done 
 the classic case of genius 
 at first misunderstood; 
 now her poems are classic 
 widely read and widely loved 
 so thank you ms dickinson 
 for dedicating yourself-- 
 to art to words to poetry-- 
 to posterity's bookshelf ""in many ways a book is in itself a tiny universe each page is like a newly formed galaxy fashioned from a single pulsing thought 
 a book travels for days for years sometimes for centuries to meet you at an exact point in time"" 
 the above quote perfect describes my feelings about this book 
 this was my first lang leav poetry book and i was truly not expecting to like this collection so much - mainly because i don't consider myself to be much of a romantic - but the universe of us really surprised me for the better (and also that cover is absolutely stunning) 
 this book covers everything from love and loss hope and hurt being lost and found and i was actually let down when i reached the ending so quickly i'll definitely be picking up more of lang leav's books very soon 
 but for now i'll share a few quotes from my favorite poems in this collection: 
 i am 
 ""and i told him if i am so hard to love then let me run wild 
 my love is not a testament to my surrender i will show you just how much i love you with the inward draw of every breath--the collective sigh of the world and all its despair but i will never give you what you want in chains"" 
 today 
 ""my demons are lying in wait they are grinning in the shadows their polished fangs glinting knowing today it will be an easy kill but tomorrow tomorrow could be different and that is what keeps me going today"" 
 the butterfly effect 
 ""i know you are scared who could blame you love is a hurricane wrapped inside a chrysalis and you are a girl walking into the storm"" 
 moment of truth 
 ""the second i tried to tell myself i wasn't in love was the moment i realized i was"" 
 conversations 
 ""most people want to save the entire world it's a lovely thought and i'm not saying it's not a noble pursuit--but it's impossible to save everyone you just have to pick your little corner of the world and focus your energy there that's the only way you will ever make a difference"" 
 a lesson 
 ""there is a girl who smiles all the time 
 to show the world that she is fine 
 a boy who surrounds himself with friends 
 wished that his life would end 
 for those that say they never knew-- 
 the saddest leave the least of clues"" 
 possibility of love 
 ""yes i think it is entirely possible to fall in love with someone you've never met physicality is an expression of intimacy--not an indication of it"" 
 her time 
 ""she can feel it down to her very core--this is her time she will not only climb mountains--she will move them too"" 
 the one 
 ""i don't want to be the one who tucks you into bed--i want to be the reason why you can't sleep at night"" 
 a whole universe 
 ""when you lose a person a whole universe goes along with them"" 
 gone 
 ""the sad thing is"" she said ""the moment you start to miss someone it means they're already gone"" 
 once 
 ""i loved you once and now i must spend my whole life explaining why"" 
 salve 
 ""you won't hear from me again after today and i don't want you to worry i'll be okay because i have to be"" 
 a premonition 
 ""but when i look at you i just know instinctively that despite the odds against you and although life will always find a way to test you someday you'll have everything you want your ending will be a happy one"" 
 loving you 
 ""loving you is like being ten years old again scaling a tree with my eyes bright and skyward wanting only to get higher and higher without a thought of how i would get back down"" 
 quiet 
 ""i've grown quiet now you won't hear me talk about you anymore it doesn't hurt like it used to i suppose that is something to be thankful for"" 
 your words 
 ""remember your words are your power never forget your words"" 
 i'm so glad to having finally read some of lang leav's writing i hope it will only go up from here 
 i also found that listening to this song really amped-up my reading experience: 
 arc kindly provided by the publisher in exchange for an honest review 
 *note: i'm an amazon affiliate if you're interested in buying the universe of us just click on the image below to go through my link i'll make a small commission* 
 this review and more can be found on my blog what do you say to someone who tells you to stop being yourself you love him and you want to marry him and he comes out with that he tells you to stop writing poetry; it's something women can't do well apparently and he tells you to give it up essentially he tells you to stop being you here is romney's ignorant argument to his aurora: 
 ""we get no christ from you- and verily 
 we shall not get a poet in my mind"" 
 aurora does the right thing she says the right things and she walks away she doesn't sacrifice herself her individuality to become some foolish man's helpmate: his restricted victorian wife she remains aurora 
 she was raised to believe in respectability and womanhood her aunt made her read guides on manners and appropriate behaviours a woman should manifest aurora didn't have the time for such crap she wasn't going to become a caged bird or someone's doll she liberated her own mind through books on history politics and art it is only when aurora discovers her father's library with its extensive range of ideas and knowledge that she feels her world and mind opening up books liberate her 
 she became intelligent enough to understand that she shouldn't be led by anyone else whether male or female she became her own person in body and soul and this hugely creative narrative poem depicts her journey through life as she comes to understand the true meaning of love her autonomy drives the poem forward; she wishes to be able to express her own thoughts and emotions in her art form similar to jane's voice in jane eyre aurora's poetry becomes a means of liberating herself and expressing her emotions and desires 
 eventually her foolish lover realises the errors of his ways he reads some of aurora's poetry and says: 
 you have the stars 'he murmured- 'it is well: 
 be like them shine aurora on my dark 
 thus everything ends in happiness but not after barret browning has made her stance very clear on the victorian woman question healthy marriage is perfectly achievable if it occurs through mutual respect and autonomy one partner should not dominate the other's personality and individualism the wife is not a simple creature to be shaped in accordance with her husband's will: she is not his helpmate she is an individual and this should be retained for a healthy marriage it seems like an obvious statement but the victorians were idiots when it came to marriage 
 she comes to regret her earlier refusal of romney; however it can be argued that their initial marriage would have been a failure because aurora would not have had her art aurora not becoming a possession of romney is browning's answer to the woman question and a love filled marriage later after there is an acceptance of the place of each in a relationship romney recognises aurora's art and individualism a healthy marriage is possible this marriage this love becomes an artistic muse for aurora oneness with god is achieved 
 this poem is very rich in sentimentality and instructive purpose oscar wilde would have hated it but that's beside the point there is a strong message in here and despite its overt nature it is an important one also of note this can easily be read alongside the fantastic jane eyre there are many crossovers in theme and message i'd recommend it to lovers of charlotte bronte's masterpiece 
 >postscript- this is the longest poem i've ever read at 300+ pages i can easily say it was as enjoyable as any novel and this quote was my favourite can you tell why 
 ""books books books 
 i had found the secret of a garret room 
 piled high with cases in my father's name; 
 piled high packed large--where creeping in and out 
 among the giant fossils of my past 
 like some small nimble mouse between the ribs 
 of a mastodon i nibbled here and there 
 at this or that box pulling through the gap 
 in heats of terror haste victorious joy 
 the first book first and how i felt it beat 
 under my pillow in the morning's dark 
 an hour before the sun would let me read 
 my books"" lang leav may become the first author to whom i don't give three chances to impress me even though this book is free on netgalley my past experiences with her have been so horrifying that i can't imagine this one will be so much improved that it will catapult her into ""tolerable"" territory especially since after making up her own rules as far as what ""poetry"" is for the past few books with this one we are told she ""evokes universal feelings with her skillfully crafted words"" 
 so now she's making up her own words crafting them like an artisan a lang leav lexicon is the last thing this world needs 
 so yeah - two strikes and then the game was called for inclement weather and then the field burned down and was repopulated by rabid wombats and no one ever went near there again ps- follow our publishing journey on facebook wwwfacebookcom/headlinersbmp 
 guys this is the book i've been helping to publish and look at the cover 
 look 
 at 
 it 
 i designed this cover and it is my baby 
 now i'm pretty biased rating this 5/5 stars but it really is a cool collection you guys should check out emily dickinson is one of my favourite poets; she is the gothic queen of poetry at times she strongly reminds me of edgar allan poe her poems are less macabre than poe's and certainly less fantastical focusing more on human perception of the darkness and the realities of life but her work is undoubtedly on par with his in the vein of dark romanticism 
 there's just something exceedingly morose about the way in which she writes she was terribly depressed for much of her life and such a pessimistic attitude to life can be seen within her writing these are the words of a woman completely disillusion with the human experience; there is little light in these poems humans are portrayed as weak and self-destructive; they are at times evil and even hellish in nature all depictions are typically one sided with the darkness conquering any sense of hope if anything hope is dead within her words there is only one thing we are striving for in life and that's the end according to such thinking 
 death 
 read enough of dickinson's poetry and you will see how obsessed with death she is; it a recurring theme across her work one she brings up time and time again she spent most of her life in solitude so it's no surprise that she came up with poetry so dark in content; she had a miserable life and it reflects in the nature of her writing: 
 ""because i could not stop for death - 
 he kindly stopped for me - 
 the carriage held but just ourselves - 
 and immortality"" 
 the words feel calm and almost serene as the speaker is accepting of her mortality she establishes the idea that death is not a choice; it just happens like life just happens so we should just sit back and enjoy the ride as she does in death's carriage it passes through the surrounding scenery at a slow pace and observes children playing near wide open fields this is indicative of the fact that death will come for everyone: there's no escaping it the speaker is only half dressed which suggest that nobody is truly ever ready for death; it comes when it will come never mind how unprepared you are death waits for no man 
 death is personified as a gentleman here one who will escort her to the afterlife death to dickinson is not the end; it is the road to immortality: the beginning indeed at the end of the poem she reveals she has actually been dead for centuries (shock-horror) we're left with the lingering image of dead horses perpetually pushing her forward into eternity it's a wonderful poem dark and gripping ethereal and enchanting of all of dickinson's poetry this is the one that sticks with me years after i first read it i still hear the opening lines 
 she also characterises god as a reckless and almost careless deity he is not the ideal that many perceive him to be at the moment of death he fumbles at your soul; you are not elevated or taken to heaven but ""stunned"" and ""scalped"" in the process then struck like a ""thunderbolt"" god has paws which make him sound animalistic and beastlike; he is not kind and forgiving death is not the end but it doesn't have to be a glamourous experience indeed in another poem the speaker is transfixed by the buzzing of a fly as she lies on her death bed it's the last thing she hears; it's her last experience on earth in this it abandons all glorified religious imagery and almost portrays an ironically realistic moment she further hints that faith only works for those that are truly devout if you don't really believe in it then calling upon god's name is pointless she suggests that those people should look to science for the answers rather than a false bastion they don't really believe in 
 dickinson is my idea of the perfect poet she is a religious sceptic but she is not dismissive of a possible truth in religion her poetry dances between opposing ideas and it doesn't suggest truth in either of them; thus it is open to interpretation and debate it can be read in different ways and through this it is profound powerful and utterly beautiful i love her unique style though she's not one that's going to leave you feeling uplifted after reading her work that's for sure this was such an empowering collection of poems it was brutal honest and deeply personal *disclaimer- as always any comments concerning politics will get the rough treatment that is delete and block* 
 ""if hieronymus bosch had gotten around to writing poems i suspect they would have sounded like novica tadia++ "" 
 charles simic 
 i feel this quote describes the nature of the poems included in this superb collection in a way more accurate than any review this is my first foray into the work of novica tadia++ and the only word i can use to describe the experience is ""shuttering"" 
 tadia++ is considered to be the finest poet in serbia and among the most significant literary figures of balkan literature born in picturesque montenegro he spent his life in beautiful belgrade and his poems seem to reflect the idea of the metropolis and its influence in our lives the isolation that often comes with living in a big city the turbulent past of a country in a region that has suffered tremendously paying a terrible price in blood and pain the search for a kind of innocence and the danger of losing hope are the main themes in this collection 
 the scenery is modern urban but hellish this is a city where demons are ready to attack there are dark corners occupied by people without property without future or hope they are sitting watching the passerby images of flames destroyed buildings houses blackened with smoke standing amidst a heavy darkness bring to mind pictures and memories of wars we all try to forget in a not so distant past darkness and claustrophobia are always present there are elements of well-known balkan folk legends and references to biblical stories 
 unfortunately i am not able to read the poems in serbian (yet) and i am certain that much is lost in translation still this collection is so powerful dark haunting nightmarish unlike anything i've ever read in terms of poetry what shocked me most is tadia++'s descriptions of the violence coming from the mob the sadistic tendency to continue beating sometime who has reached the lowest point that seems to be planted in every human being looking for the chance to come to surface as i was reading the busy metropolis came alive in my mind nightly streets still wet with rain dimmed lights in the distance footsteps walking noisily in a hurry lonely people smoking in a corner reflections of troubled faces on the glass reflections on the waters of the sava and the danube 
 there were five poems that i couldn't stop thinking about: 
 midnight lady 
 ""dumbstruck night creatures 
 will now see the face of death 
 the zero the shrew the abyss"" 
 dark things 
 ""night is their kingdom 
 and this day just breaking 
 is their cloak of light"" 
 armful of twigs dream 
 ""flames rise and the glow 
 beyond the ecstatic crowd 
 singing shouting and firing guns"" 
 city at night 
 ""in this city with its dimmed lights 
 where there appears to be no one 
 did you see the wreckers 
 wrecking buildings wrecking bridges 
 filling up the river with rubble"" 
 the poem titled amidst the noise is shuttering a guernica in poetic form 
 i don't have anything more to say except that you owe it to yourselves to read this collection sometimes nightmares can be of a special kind of striking beauty i plan to visit the white city again this winter and i know these poems will not leave my mind easily 
 1 
 poor us we are all kings 
 when we gaze at the starry sky 
 2 
 the noise of the crowd grows faint 
 on the town square and in our blood 
 3 
 the voice will re-enter the angelaeur(tm)s trumpet 
 once again hell will rise on its feet

 wmshy this long-awaited second collection of poetry by rupi kaur made waves; it was a ride brimming with of every kind of emotion imaginable divided into five chapters and illustrated by kaur the sun and her flowers is a vibrant and transcendent journey about growth and healing ancestry and honoring one's roots expatriation and rising up to find a home within yourself 
 kaur's voice is as audacious and brave as ever she nails to perfection the specific intimate details that made her writing so achingly real in milk and honey we have poems exploring self-love self-hate body-image girls supporting girls motherly love feminism insecurity sexual assault and so much more i read through it in a whirlwind i barely put it down and it was so short i didn't even have to 
 the author's smart poised and down-to-earth writing oozes inspiration and i'm beyond eager to share some of my favorite pieces: 
 i'll never grow tired of reading kaur's passionate words and i hope there's more and more to await in the future regarding her poetry

 this review and more can be found on my blog it wasn't a book that i really enjoyed much 
 new material by tolkien 
 i was really eager to read it since i found so awesome the idea of reading a ""new"" book by jrr tolkien 
 something that i'd never think that it could be possible 
 of course i know that it was thanks to the editing of his son christopher tolkien 
 but still it was a ""new"" book by tolkien 
 a sword hard to take out from stone 
 i found interesting some information of the legend of king arthur in the further notes by tolkien's son however the verses themselves by jrr tolkien were written in an english so old that i hardly could make some sense out of was happening in the narrative in all cases they were the afternotes by tolkien's son were i understood what supposed to happening on the verses 
 also a key factor of reading this book was the mention that there was a connection between the events here and the epic saga of the lord of the rings 
 however i was expecting something more insightful about the connection of arthur's legend and the middle-earth's stories but the connection mentioned here was something that i already figured it out before and i heard it in some other tv documentary about it 
 nevertheless it's great to add of some tolkien's work in my list of already read books these are 
 just simple 
 sentences 
 broken up 
 with spaces 
 seriously some of them i was like i love this but i didn't view them as poems they're more like simple quotes but i get that this is a kind of poetry and people love it but to me it's just not anything special hl st'khdhk mny

 >shhrzd lkhlyj < nki bhq ry'`h oh odysseus how i love thee but bro you need to get a grip here's an experiment i'd like a teacher to try for me don't ""teach"" this newbery award winner instead place a copy of crossover on each student's desk before they enter the classroom maybe upside down and backward to make it a bit more tempting and then wait to see what happens 
 if the students say ""do we have to read this"" answer ""i was curious whether anyone would want to"" if they say ""what are we going to do with this book"" answer ""i thought i'd ask you that question"" if they ask ""is there going to be a test"" answer ""do you think there should be"" if they ask ""what's it about"" answer ""just about anything you want it to be about"" and then wait to see what happens 
 maybe you could do a bit of action research count how many open it up how many start acting up how many keep chatting until they notice someone who doesn't usually read is getting caught up in its pages take notes on comments you see the book starts out

 swoooooooooosh 
 but each chapter uses a different style of poetry (oh please don't have the kids analyze it all) there's cool white space for taking notes (it'd be so cool to give each class a different ink color and let them make notes in to to the others using the same copy but don't require it) there's themes of friendship and family and courage and sportsmanship and academics and fairness and more (but don't make them write a five-paragraph essay) it isn't just a basketball book it's got something for everyone try it and let me know what happens have your ever met a person who does something that should be annoying but for some reason when this particular person does it you don't find it annoying at all i thought about this recently when i read the 77 dream songs and began to think about john berryman and robert lowell 
 interested in the origins of confessional poetry i decided to read life studies (1959) by robert lowell grand-daddy of confessional poets teacher of sexton and plath but i hated it every other line harbored some obscure biographical reference or arcane allusion worse the argument of each poem was so elliptical that context gave me little clue i couldn't force my way through it i gave up 
 still interested in confessional poetry i resolved to read 77 dream songs a work of confessional poetry that john berryman lowell's contemporary published five years after life studies almost immediately from the first dream song i was immersed in magnificent language aware that berryman was speaking about cataclysmic loss: 
 all the world like a woolen lover 
 once did seem on henry's side 
 then came a departure 
 thereafter nothing fell out as it might or ought 
 i don't see how henry pried 
 open for all the world to see survived 
 i liked the third dream song too the way it relegated rilke to the rim of dantes' hell rilke the transcendent poet who was also an unscrupulous manipulator of women particularly his aristocratic neurasthenic patrons: 
 rilke was a jerk 
 i admit his griefs & music 
 & titled spelled all-disappointed ladies 
 a threshold worse than the circles 
 where the vile settle and lurk 
 rilke's    
 and then i was completely won over by this description in ""dream song 4"" of a woman at a dinner party whom the speaker is eyeing lustfully: 
 filling her compact & delicious body 
 with chicken paprika she glanced at me 
 twice 
 fainting with interest i hungered back 
 and only the fact of her husband and four other people 
 kept me from springing on her 
 or falling at her little feet and crying 
 'you are the hottest one for years of night 
 henry's dazed eyes 
 have enjoyed brilliance' i advanced upon 
 (despairing) my spumoni 
 i was hooked there were greater delights to come--including the much anthologized dream song 14--but i knew then and there i wanted to read this book to the end i did so and would recommend it as one of the great poetic achievements of the 20th century and one of my favorite poetry collections too 
 here comes the funny part 77 dreams songs is allusive and obscure perhaps worse than lowell's life studies a dozen dream songs still baffle me and there are at least a dozen more i only incompletely understand besides the three shifting voices--henry mr bones and the ""author"" --drive me crazy where does one leave off and another begin who is saying what to whom 
 all this should be annoying and yet somehow it isn't the music of the verse makes up for everything the heart's cry singing in every line wins my respect and love 
 you remember the person i talked about before the person you meet with the annoying habit who turns out not to be annoying at all poets can be like that too and in my experience whenever you meet someone like that--either a person or poet--it could be the sign of a friendship that is to come i found a beautiful 40th anniversary edition of this at costco and just had to pick it up such a great book throwback to childhood waddup this is another one of those times when my star ratings only make sense to me and no one should dismiss this book because i ""only"" gave it three stars since some people seem to think three stars is a bad thing 
 which it is not 
 however this is my second sam pink book and i liked it slightly less than i am going to clone myself then kill the clone and eat it which i gave four stars so blah-di-bloo 
 if you read my review of the first book of his i read just insert ""ditto"" here it is more of the same kind of sad and true and damaged reflections from a sad and true and damaged individual that manages to be horrifying and funny and occasionally sweet but which is also so many times saying what i am thinking that it is sobering and scary 
 but it's better to just let his words speak for themselves: 
 ---i've seen a crowd of people in my head and the whole crowd points at me saying ""ewwww"" and is then quiet 
 and the quiet is always worse that the ""ew"" 
 ---right now there's at least one other person thinking about cutting someone they know in half like a magician using a saw - only without any illusion - without any saw - and this person is someone the magician knows - and this person has taught the magician the trick 
 ---sometimes things are done when you say they're done - and sometimes before you even notice 
 ---i'd love to cut your face open with the smaller blade on a swiss army knife 
 but who wouldn't 
 ---this is good 
 this is so good i am so happy right now 
 this is my maniac youth 
 and the maniac youth will never be over 
 because it is always just beginning 
 27 years old and responsible enough to think being born is always an accident 
 fuck this 
 give me thirty minutes and i'll feel completely different 
 ---""you never smile"" 
 ""i've never seen you smile"" 
 ""how come you don't smile"" 
 ""why don't you ever smile"" 
 ""why are you smiling like that"" 
 ---my first reaction to not hearing from someone in a while is that s/he has discovered a good reason not to like me - a reason i'd immediately agree with if told 
 and check this shit out - my main reason for not communicating is not wanting to bother someone 
 cool dude 
 slamdunk dude 
 ---i avoid things that will make me happy because those things are the hardest to think about later 
 later is the worst 
 it's time to hurt a thing that can't defend itself 
 it's time to see the immense clear tendon that runs through all occurring things 
 it's time to feel the worst 
 ---when i was five me and another kid who was five would show each other our dicks on the school bus home every day not sure why it happened more than once who knows 
 ---because it's a bad thing to realize you're being guarded by someone you'd never fully confess to but that's half of any relationship 
 ---thinking about my future - which always ends up turning into a vision of my burnt corpse in an overgrown dandelioned backyard in the midwest during spring getting eaten by a malnourished german shepherd 
 the midwest is beautiful 
 ---you see old birthday cards you've kept for some reason and each one joins the swarming sharp things that make pulp of your heart 
 ---you just ate a fudgesicle and it dominated your taste buds and you kept repeating ""fucking domination"" in your head until it's senseless and it's time to go to bed already 
 ---you are a big monster made of wet newspaper and you get pushed down every three seconds and no one's afraid of you 
 ---you built a small dwelling in your closet with some hangers and a sheet and you did this to avoid people not to have fun 
 ---you're older now than you've ever been and it's not something you look forward to continuing over and over endlessly 
 you hear ambulance sounds and think they are for you and you like it 
 ---at the van buren bridge watching traffic go beneath me and wondering if i can jump down and run along the tops of cars 
 at the van buren bridge laughing after i imagine how i'd land on the first car and fall violently to the ground smashed and limp 
 ---in the alley behind the 7-11 deciding it's time to walk home and be there 
 halfway home deciding to live beneath a car parked on the street 
 halfway under the car parked on the street deciding i can't fit 
 ---you see people outside your window and you lean out the windowframe and go ""hey catch me ok"" then jump before there is an answer 
 ---you really don't care what other people think and it's not at all like it was when you said that but didn't mean it 
 ---you have never approved of yourself so you bother other people to do it 
 you are an invisible trail of replicating statues each more fun to be around than the last 
 you never help out people as much as they help you and that's the underside of something even uglier and it bothers you 
 you have dumb hands 
 you go to public ares and you expect people to group up and tell you you add nothing and you should leave and you are willing to congratulate them on being right 
 you don't argue 
 you just ate so much cereal your stomach hurts bad 
 you mention when someone else has stolen a relatively worthless pen because you have principles 
 you think principles are real 
 you eat things even if they aren't fully microwaved because you don't deserve any luxury 
 you are the most beautiful motherfucker on the planet forever times the square root of 78889 
 you seem like a servant to someone you hope eventually asks you for something for anything 
 you get dead so slow 
 you lost all your hair but i still love you 
 you will feel pain 
 you will not learn from it 
 you will be mistreated by people because somebody has to do it and at least you get to pick who 
 you congratulate yourself on being right 
 you are married to trying to defend yourself and you have soft gumlines for weapons you motherfucker 
 you get preferential treatment in your own bad afterlife 
 you are right to ruin yourself now so the afterlife will be a handicapped parking space 
 you will not learn from it

 uggg those are not in order i had a hard time reading my writing and finding them on the contents pages who cares if they are in order it's my ocd 
 i'm glad to all of those that love all of his stuff at my college graduation the speaker was a gruff professor he was one of those older men whom people somewhat patronizingly describe as a teddy bear to convey the idea that while he looks like santa claus they wouldn't be surprised to see him arraigned on assault charges at the local courthouse i liked this professor in general and his graduation speech was a grand: warm congratulations on a crisp early-summer day he decided to inform us however that anyone who had not read the iliad and the odyssey should not be graduating from college i was one of those lucky (lucky) folks like an illiterate kid graduating from high school 
 i decided to rectify the situation as soon as possible and i spent an indefinite number of hours in the next few sunny weeks laying in a hammock on my porch the boy i loved commiserating with me about this wonderful book it is a warm sharp memory that was mumble mumble years ago and this summer i thought that since i just graduated again i would read it again it was a good choice warm summer days in the hammock with limb-chopping flashing helms and mountain goats rushing down the hillside 
 i can't find this quote i'm thinking of but i'm pretty sure it's from beowulf and it goes something like ""brave men should seek fame in foreign lands"" google does not think that quote exists so maybe i dreamed it which is really neither here nor there but kind of weird something about that quote about this book and about the way this book reminds me of that quote makes my blood beat close to my skin i get this feeling that my heart grows too big for my ribs and my eyeballs get tight as though i'm going to cry but my heart doesn't pound and no tears come 
 that is how this book feels to me 
 this story is about what homer doesn't describe as much as what he does and reading it evokes some kind of mirroring response from my body the iliad is the almost-death of achilles the almost-destruction of troy and reading it is an almost-panic-attack an almost-sob it is the absent top step in a flight of stairs but oh man that flight of stairs how do you even make that 
 it's not possible to spoil this story because homer is always one step ahead tripping you up about what story he's telling so just because i think it's fun (and also because it seems kind of absurd to write a ""review"" of the iliad so i'm wandering in the dark here) i'm going to give a brief summary: 
 this story is about a bunch of guys fighting over some women fleshlights and jewelry mostly the women fleshlights everyone's been at this war for nine years (sidebar: weirdly when i read that it was nine years i thought ""nine years who would fight a war for that long oh wait    "") as you probably know the war initially started because paris a trojan stole helen who was the iphone 5 of fleshlights from menelaus an argive the argives are at their ships; the trojans are in ilium behind the city walls there's lots of blood and guts and pillaging throughout 
 this story homer clearly tells us is about paris and helen's betrayal of menelaus and it is about the death of achilles the story opens with agamemnon the king of the argives having stolen a fancy new fleshlight from achilles who is a child of a water nymph achilles refuses to continue fighting if agamemnon is going to take his fleshlight then achilles has this beautiful beautiful moment where he questions the very nature of fighting over fleshlights we are all pawns in the petty squabbles of the gods 
 the gods are easily my favorite parts of this story though it is not really about them in a certain way it is not really about them in the way that any discussion of a god is not really about the god on the one hand it is about how our lives are just pawns in this squabbling incestuous eternal thanksgiving dinner in the sky on the other hand it is still about the pawns the gods are compelling on their own but my heart tries to escape my chest not because of their story but because yes humans do live and die by some kind of petty lottery run by a rapist married to his sister yes and maybe there is someone bold and wonderful in the sky like the grey-eyed athena but we still live and die by the thunder of a maniacal drunk uncle yes that seems true 
 so in the midst of the chopping of limbs the shatteringly beautiful similes death after death and the machinations of the dysfunctional immortal family this story is about the betrayal of menelaus and the death of achilles the thing that is absolutely hands-down the most insane about this story to me is that those two events are deeply vivid in my mind in connection to this book but neither of them actually happens here how is that possible how do you plant enough seeds about an event in a reader's mind that when she closes a book those seeds grow into whole robust images about the event my blood does that thing where it tries to get out of my skin just from thinking about that i can picture achilles's death so vividly picture lying in that hammock and reading it after i graduated from college but that never happened homer just planted the seeds of his death in my brain and they grew from my constant pondering over them helen and paris sailing away grew in my mind through helen's beautiful regrets 
 this is a story that i could think about for days: helen's mourning like the women i've seen apologize for causing their husbands' abuse (no you didn't cause this); war and the futility of killing each other as though we are controlled by the kardashians of the sky what causes violence we say women cause violence because they push our buttons so we're driven to maim and kill because of the betrayals and button pushing we say that something eternal god or the gods cause violence because they control our fate they appear to us as birds and as wisdom and lead us on our night-blind path of life but they lead us erratically: drunk hysterical drivers and us with no seat belt so we grasp for mere survival homer describes those motivations for violence so beautifully 
 but ultimately i think that is all bullshit and i think the bullshitness of it is there in this story too it is there in achilles challenging agamemnon it is there in achilles mourning patroclus oh patroclus about whom i haven't even freaked in this review what a shame anyway though people are not violent because we were betrayed or because of supernatural trickery our violence is ours; it is our choice and our responsibility life is barbarous and cruel around us but that is its nature and we can only shape ourselves through and around it when we expect life to be gentle and obedient we are usually doing nothing more than justifying our own cruelty i don't think there is an answer to any of this in the iliad but it is beautifully told in both the positive and negative space it is blood-poundingly eye-achingly told as my professor said everyone should read this and if you can read it in the sun lying in a hammock after your graduation all the better 'n lly `mry shtyq fy shtyq

 'hbh bbst@ kthyr through teaching my mother how to give birth the empowerment of women becomes like a burning tempest kindled up by the rawness of warsan shire's words the poems are also about reality the horrors that some people have to face in a word driven by war they carry with them such human depth none more so than the poem in love and in war 
 ""to my daughter i will say 
 'when the men come set yourself on fire'"" 
 the poem is only two lines but it establishes the tone for the rest of the work; it acts like a summary for one of her strongest ideals that of personal and cultural integrity 
 shire does not compromise the idea of setting oneself on fire is tangible to suicide the men are coming the soldiers and sons of war so let us end it before they can touch us this can be read as an act by a woman burning herself to avoid the objectifying effects that are coming her way historically speaking the women of an invaded country often become the greatest victims we all know what humans can do when in a blood frenzy by committing suicide these daughters can avoid the worse of such possible crimes but the act of setting oneself on fire can be read in a different way a much brighter way 
 like all great poetry multiple readings come out of shire's words i like to think of the fire as a metaphorical flame of individuality when the invaders come set your hearts ablaze and remember who you are; remember your culture; remember your language: remember you when the men come do no lose this sense of you to the superimposing of another's beliefs become angry fight against it rage at the injustice and learn how to beat it but at the very root of it all never ever forget in such an idea shire establishes the authority of the individual's voice 
 how about love as a woman entering a relationship set yourself on fire in the same sense do not become meek and docile: do not allow him to take over this reading feels like one of the strongest if you compare this to the ideas that are manifested in the spoken word poem for women who are difficult to love it becomes more evident the ideas empower women and suggest that if you are volatile if your personality is like that of a fire do not quench yourself: carry on be yourself he is not worthy if he cannot love you for you: keep that fire burning 
 there's also another reading that comes here tangible to the first instance of suicide when men are near and love is close set yourself on fire and avoid heartache but i do not overly belief in this one; it can be read in the poem but when comparing it to shire's body of work it seems far too pessimistic shire is about empowering women not destroying life she is a humanist; thus there is much to be taken from her words they are words that need to be heard now more than ever as the world becomes increasingly multi-cultural and transgendered understanding the perspective of others is vital for the development of a more accepting world this is a very powerful collection of poetry moving on as a concept is for stupid people because any sensible person knows grief is a long-term project 
 this is a book about two boys and their father dealing with their mother's death 
 it's a very unusual book 
 unusual because their ""grief counsellor"" is a crow yes a black bird 
 unusual because only at the end do we truly know what happened to the mother 
 unusual because in truth it doesn't matter how the mother died but what happens to those left behind 
 unusual for its language which is cryptic at times - especially when crow first arrives (i had to read that one chapter three times and still only had a vague idea what the author was trying to say) and very simple but heavy at others 
 the story is being told in chapters of ""crow"" ""dad"" and ""boys"" and shows how each party is feeling about and dealing with the situation and it doesn't sugarcoat anything gradually a more complete picture emerges and a progression can be seen 
 in between there is lots of wonderful prose sometimes even funny (especially the chapter about gran) passages 
 to me the important message is the quote at the beginning of this review and the fact that this family is not ""functional"" as society would call it after the mother has died they do everything their own way and that's ok because everyone griefs differently and the world needs to finally accept and respect that 
 also i loved the concept of crow staying with them until they no longer need it (a bit like nanny mcfee but the true origin story of crow is so lovely) 
 it's a small book but full of wonderfully resounding lines that strike a deep cord with the reader and stay with you for a long time inconspicuous yet enormously powerful scattering 
 words

 lines

 poetry i have read some rather hilarious discussions over the last day across social media regarding bob dylan's right or lack thereof to the noble literature prize 
 one of the funniest was a rather lengthy post by an unnamed individual who defined ""true literature"" according to his infinite wisdom this excludes all poetry and song you see novels are the most complex form of literary expression because they are the longest and most thought out; therefore dylan isn't literature another post claimed that literature is the written word so dylan's work being spoken/sung means it's also not literature: its music 
 these people clearly have never read a poem so they should keep their ignorant mouths shut 
 now i had trouble not setting these people to rights i mean opinion of the arts is always a subjective thing highbrow or lowbrow it's all about personal reaction but that is beside the point here objectively speaking dylan's work is literature there's no two ways about it no room for discussion only fact words set to rhythm with metre are a form of poetry stick some instruments in the background and it becomes music but it's still poetry: they just become lyrics people who fail to recognise this fact ignore the point of poetry most poetry is meant to be spoken and some cannot be read without singing dylan's work is literature and for all his contribution to the arts he deserves the noble prize 
 to say otherwise is to ignore countless generations of oral tradition and by extension spit in the face of poetry itself this collection of poetry here isn't why dylan won the prize this is mainly experimental stuff and it isn't as good as his music it's his lyricism that did it but this seems an appropriate place to have a little rant about stupid people who don't understand literature"
5,romance," possible spoilers and definitely nsfw (unless your workplace is made of awesome). 
 oh, my god, you guys, this book! oh, my god... 
 i went into this thinking it was going to be completely and totally lame. another fifty shades of moronic writing. another horrifying testament to the standards which modern writers are apparently held. and do you know what? it was. buuuut....for the most part, i had a good time. how? by laughing uncontrollably at nearly every sex scene (and believe me, there are many). 
 there isn't much of a plot, but then, i guess there doesn't really need to be since it's just smut cleverly (*snort*) disguised as literature. but fans generally defend the story, and i've gotta say, as far as stories go, it's pretty lame. i mean, come on, peeps. they're damaged, they're melodramatic, they're whiny and self-absorbed, they're like, sooo hot, and the entire ""story"" is them fucking and then whining about it, and then fucking some more. when i first got started, i was terrified because i hit pretentious wordage in the second sentence: 
 ""i wasn't surprised by my roommate's emphatic pronouncement."" 
 the entire book goes on in a similar vein. plus there's the added bonus of being told very inconsequential details, like what color shoes eva's wearing, how many steps she had to climb, how often she eats yogurt to keep regular (i'm making up my own, but you get the gist). having your eyes raped by adjectives and other useless textual diarrhea does not usually make for a highly compelling read. there is seriously a point where eva tells the reader how in love she is with new york because it's so different from her hometown of san diego with all the people and activity and sights and sounds (i'm really not kidding). the first quarter of the book was basically just useless info dump nonsense. 
 things picked up a little bit when eva first met gideon, only because the writing in that scene was so ludicrous. phrases like ""exquisite masculinity"", ""magnificent maleness"", ""scorching force of will""...and let's not forget such treasures as, 
 ""i thought for a moment that he might be able to make me orgasm just by talking long enough."" 
 and 
 ""i looked at him in his civilized, urbane, outrageously expensive suit and thought of raw, primal, sheet-clawing fucking."" 
 <--- try saying that three times fast. 
 this was also when i was introduced to gideon's apparent mind control powers. eva just goes on and on about how he's put some kind of spell on her, she's inexplicably drawn to him, caught up in his magnetic force, blabbidy blah blah. i suppose it doesn't hurt that gideon is ""savagely gorgeous"", and that eva's eyes ""burned just from looking at him"". 
 but then! oh, then i got to the good stuff. i'm not saying that as a pervert, but as a lover of all things inappropriately hilarious. if i didn't know any better, i would swear to everything holy that this book is satire. because while some of the sex scenes were hot, they were almost always laced with one or two lines that had me laughing so hard i was in tears. 
 without further ado, i'm going to treat you to a small sampling. seriously, prepare yourselves for this. take a deep breath, make sure your bladder is empty and that you've got water and aid nearby in case you fall over. and for the love of eye bleach, don't let your kids read it: 
 ""...his powerful body straining with the primal need to mate."" 
 ""the rhythmic slap of his heavy balls against the curve of my buttocks."" 
 ""then he ripped open his button fly and pulled his big, beautiful penis out."" 
 ""gideon battered my tender sex with that brutally thick column of rigid flesh..."" 
 ""...his breath leaving him in primitive grunts every time he hit the end of me."" 
 ""'i'm so deep in you...i can feel it against my stomach...feel my dick pounding into you.'"" 
 seriously, is that shit supposed to be sexy? because it's just not. he can feel his dick through her abdomen? no. that's not how wombs work. or dicks. or anything. she calls her ass her rear, and that's silly when you're talking about a guy finger banging your fart box, but when gideon jammed his finger into her ""puckered hole"", i nearly lost my dinner/sanity/sense of direction. just take your pick because my mind shorted out for a few seconds. i hate the word ""puckered"" and all its variations now. i really wish she'd just called it her puckering poopshoot and at least given the reader the joy of alliteration. did i mention he's apparently ramming his semen in there? oh, and this is after she stands up and drips his load all over the floor, making gideon all hot and bothered because, apparently, lack of adequate hygiene is a major turn on for rich, neurotic alpha males. 
 [edit 12/21/15: i read mostly m/m romance now, and i've read and enjoyed some pretty raunchy anal sex scenes, complete with semen insertion. and you know what? i still don't find this book hot.] 
 at one point, gideon says he feels a desire to ""mark"" eva like she's his property... 
 i always get sidetracked when writing reviews like this because all i ever want to focus on is how funny it all is, but maybe you want to hear how the story stacks up, how the characterization is, how the plot progresses, or what the obstacles are. i can probably sum each area up in five words or less. 
 story: two people fucking. 
 characterization: cliched and irritating. 
 plot progression: it's two people fucking...? 
 obstacles: sexual abuse and shallowness. 
 yes, they're both damaged and need each other and he's dark and brooding and she's blonde and angelic and the two of them end up in this mindfuck of a relationship, this monumentally codependent clusterfuck of sex and jealousy and petty mind games, and when i wasn't laughing, i kinda wanted to shoot myself in the face. 
 guess what else?! gideon gets all rapey when he's sleepy! (no, seriously, he rapes in his sleep...) 
 it's stupid. 
 really, really stupid. 
 so why two stars? i'll tell you why two stars... 
 ""the room lit up in a sudden flare of illumination. i turned toward him...and found him masturbating with shocking viciousness."" 
 happy reading! being a male reader on a booksite you kind of expect to be outnumbered when it comes to the sexes. but that doesn't keep alarm bells from blaring like a convoy of reversing trucks when practically every reviewer of a book is of the female gender. and when the author in addition is touted as the winner of multiple romance novel awards your primal male instinct is to run like your being chased by some primordial predator. 
 so it was really against my instinct and better judgement that i began reading this book. but this is not a romance novel. in fact it is a brilliant comment on the issue of euthanasia which claims it's brilliance by reading like a romance novel and not a political comment. having personally cared for a handful of terminal people over a period of years, i feel i can safely say that many of the thoughts on serious aquired disabities and the quality of life is fairly realistic, and though the romance part can't avoid a bit of hollywood-sheen, it never really gets unbelievable, and helps the reader engage him/herself in the characters and thus in their horrible dilemma. 
 thoroughly engaging and thought provoking, this is the best book i've read so far this year (and i so did not see it coming). lady midnight tore me apart then pieced me back together....then tore me apart again. 
 loved this book! 
 a very detailed review will be up on my channel later this week! :) this first part was originally written in 2012. 
 jesus the book isn't even out yet and you guys are trashing it already. seriously, wait at least until it comes out, read it and then give your opinion. right now it's just useless and pissing all of us fans off. she's not milking this. if she really just wanted more money, she wouldn't work so hard on all of this beautiful material she's creating for us. for us. she doesn't have to do this, she could be working as a doctor or a lawyer and making money. and if you think those two jobs are harder and that writing is easier, you're 100% wrong. it's not easy, it's hard as hell but she does it. and she does it beautifully. it's even harder to get published and get enough books sold. do your research before you go around calling people cash cows. we've all got to make a living. some people do it by working at jobs that they absolutely hate and some, like ms. clare, do it by sticking with what they're passionate about. so what if she makes money? her books are amazing and if you don't like them, that's fine. but it's rude to trash talk a series that isn't even written yet. in fact, it's rude to trash talk anything but the least you could do is hold off until you have something to trash talk. 
 ---- 
 oh my god. i knew this book would be amazing and it was. so. freaking. amazing. 
 cassandra clare, you have done it yet again. you've managed to make me care so much about characters i just met and made me feel their happiness, pain, sadness as if it were my own. i was so sad when i saw the last page. and then the last conversation... really? really?! gah! 
 i really hope that the people who were trash talking have read it and been stunned. she created yet another beautiful masterpiece and i was more than happy to spend money on it. ""i cheated on her every day. in my mind, i thought of you in ways i shouldn't have, again and again. she was nothing compared to you. i've never felt this way about anybody before--"" 
 what's the saying? once a cheater, always a cheater? oh, the fucking hypocrisy. 
 there were many things i wanted to do to anna oliphant throughout this book. some of them involve a bottle of choloroform, a shovel, and an unmarked grave. mostly, i just want to bring anna in front of the us congress as an example of how the us educational system has grievously failed our students. to be frank, anna oliphant is a motherfucking idiot. 
 yeah, i guess you could say this is a sweet romance, but it's not the good sort of sweet. it's the ""oh my god, why did i eat that entire package of oreos? i don't even like oreos!"" sort of sweet. it's sickening, and best in small doses, and i still feel like i need an internal cleanse after spreading the reading of this book over several days. the good thing about it is that this book isn't the sugar-free type of sweet, so there were no anal explosions. it wasn't the worst contemporary i've ever read, but this book was tremendously annoying and i simply do not understand the hype. i know many of people enjoyed it, and i can see why. anna is the sort of character that grows on you, much like mildew, or herpes. once you get used to having it, it doesn't really bother you much anymore. 
 i'm not opposed to romance. i love romance, but i read this book hoping to be swept away by a romance. instead, i was sucked into a whirlwind of idiocy. 
 oh, the stupidity!!: 
 the only french word i know is oui, which means ""yes,"" and only recently did i learn it's spelled o-u-i and not w-e-e. 
 people like anna oliphant is the reason why everyone hates americans. anna is 17, and she is a moron. she is the epitome of the stupid, ignorant, egocentric american. for fuck's sakes, she thinks there are motherfucking mimes on every fucking corner in france. she thinks that people go watch mimes as an everyday pastime! 
 i'm going to be sick. i'm going to vomit that weird eggplant tapenade i had for dinner, and everyone wil hear, and no one will invite me to watch the mimes escape from their invisible boxes, or whatever it is people do here in their spare time. 
 i'm sorry, but i'm inclined to judge anyone who doesn't know that 
 oui 
 is spelled o-u-i and not w-e-e. it's one of those foreign words that isn't even fucking foreign because it's so fucking common. oui is yes in french. si is yes in spanish. it's one of those words that's so fucking commonly used that you have to be a complete birdbrain not to know! 
 anna is terrified of anything foreign, although to me, france really isn't that foreign or exotic, but i didn't grow up in atlanta. is atlanta really that ass-fucking backward? is atlanta really completely isolated from the rest of the world, despite being one of the biggest cities in the us (anna's words). do they not have paninis in atlanta? 
 ""where have you been all my life?"" i ask the beautiful panini. ""how is it possible i've never had a sandwich like this before?"" 
 not only is she ignorant, she has no survival skills. anna is in paris, attending a school for americans. fucking everyone speaks english, the french teachers speak english. anna is terrified of getting food in the cafeteria and avoids the cafeteria for weeks because she doesn't know how to order food. 
 let me tell you a brilliant way of ordering food, in any language. you smile, you make eye contact at the desired food, you point, you nod. it's motherfucking universal. 
 i hate to say it, but if you're a pretty girl, you can get anyone's help (most likely a guy, but often another girl, too) just by looking cute and helpless and tilting your head at an angle (guilty as charged). it ain't feminist, but it works when one is desperate, and the fact that anna doesn't have the fucking common sense to do this instead of hiding in her room for weeks like a motherfucking pussy doesn't bring her up in my estimation. i'm not judging anna for being shy. anna is not shy. i was a shy, shy teenager. anna is incompetent. there is a difference between incompetency and shyness. 
 after weeks and weeks of going to classes, of learning french...anna doesn't know how to fucking spell ""please"" in french. 
 mer is next in line, and i transcribe her speech phonetically. 
 oon ploss see voo play. 
 that's suppsed to be une place, s'il vous plait. 
 her impression of paris is one with like, blah blah marie antoinette and that really short dude, like, i think his name is napoleon? you know, like, the one on the horse in that painting by that dude? and oh my god, the moulin rouge, and that cute little movie with the little girl in the yellow thingy! madeline! 
 and this is a chick who wants to be a film critic when she grows up. 
 my dream is to study film theory in california. i want to be our nation's greatest female film critic. 
 although judging from the way she thinks, i think she's more suited to a career writing for the tabloids, the type with the sort of ""president obama caught in interplanetary orgy along with putin and merkel"" headline rather than as a film critic. 
 i wonder if matt is a better kisser now that he has someone more experienced to practice on. he was probably a bad kisser because of me. 
 oh, no. 
 i'm a bad kisser. i am, i must be. 
 someday i'll be awarded a statue shaped like a pair of lips, and it'll be engraved with the words world's worst kisser.and matt will give a speech about how he only dated me because he was desperate, but i didn't put out, so i was a waste of time because cherrie milliken liked him all along and she totally puts out. 
 oh god. does toph think i'm a bad kisser? 
 anna, anna, anna!!!!!: so beautiful without knowing it!! so perfect! so adorably fucking clumsy! she even looks gorgeous when she falls flat on her fucking face! 
 ""you're beautiful."" 
 i trip and fall down on the sidewalk. 
 i look away as he takes my hand and helps me up. ""i'm fine. fine!"" i say, brushing the grit from my palms. oh my god, i am a freak. 
 ""you've seen the way men look at you, right?"" he continues. 
 ""if they're looking, it's because i keep making a fool of myself."" 
 i've seen this before. and it ain't cute. spare me the whole adorkable thing. i don't like zooey deschanel, and i don't like anna. it just looks like she's trying too fucking hard, and the cute but oh-so-clumsy trope is just so fucking overplayed right now. i wash my hands of it. 
 it's not blatant, but the relationships between the girls in this book are meant to portray anna as the good one, the best one, the most adorakablest girly girl in the whole wide fucking world. rashmi is ""rash."" cute. i don't think so. mer is just a little chubby. volleyball player chubby, but it's ok ^_^; amanda the slut, amanda the bitch. and anna. anna is just so good because you know, she feels really bad that etienne likes her, so she does everything she can to make mer not jealous. it's not mer's fault that she's not good enough for etienne! and boy, saint anna keeps reminding us that she's a good person! 
 and poor ellie. poor ellie, etienne's girlfriend. but surely, it's ok for etienne to cheat on ellie with anna if she looks like a slut, right? 
 slutty nurse. i don't believe it. tiny white button-up dress, red crosses across the nipples. cleavage city. 
 cheating is ok if your girlfriend is a bitch: that's the message that this book sends. oh, that ellie. that stupid, stuck up ellie. ellie who thinks she is better than everyone else. surely it's fine if etienne seeks comfort elsewhere if his girlfriend is a cold fish, a stuck up snot, right? no. i don't fucking think so. how about you break up with her first? just because a girl is a jerk doesn't mean she deserves to be cheated on. i do not appreciate the way this book sends the message that it's morally acceptable to cheat on a girlfriend who neglects you! but it's morally acceptable to cheat on her if you feeeeeeeeeeeeel bad about it, right? fuck this shit. 
 the cheating: and yes, it is cheating. what do you call this? 
 ""i said you were beautiful. i slept in your bed!"" 
 ""you never made a move! you had a girlfriend!"" 
 ""no matter what a terrible boyfriend i was, i wouldn't actually cheat on her. but i thought you'd know. with me being there, i thought you'd know."" 
 ok. etienne has a girlfriend, ellie. etienne holds hands with anna. he is still with ellie. 
 it's nice holding hands. comfortable. 
 i wish friends held hands more often, like the children i see on the streets sometimes. i'm not sure why we have to grow up and get embarrassed about it. 
 you know why? because you wouldn't like it if etienne held hands with another girl if he was dating you. fucking hypocrite. 
 friends don't sleep in each others' beds. 
 i mean i didn't sleep sleep with him. obviously. but i slept with him. 
 i slept with a boy! i burrow back down into my sheets and grin. 
 and that boy has a girlfriend. and then you do it again. while he still has a girlfriend. while you have an almost-boyfriend. 
 you make eye contact and blush at each other in a theatre. while he has a girlfriend. 
 you kiss each other. while he has a girlfriend. while you have an almost-boyfriend. 
 you flirt with each other. while he has a girlfriend. while you have an almost-boyfriend. 
 i don't see this relationship lasting very long. head's up: if any of you fuckers comment at the bottom of this review and say, ""you don't understand bdsm"" i will hunt you down and make you eat your computer, plus the mouse, plus the keyboard, plus any other internet-connected devices in your home, including but not limited to iphones, ipods, ipads, androids, games consoles and ereaders. this book is not an accurate or healthy portrayal of a real bdsm relationship between two consensual and enthusiastic parties. thus, by defending it as such, you are doing a disservice to the actual culture of bdsm (no kinkshaming). so don't fuck with me and try to pull that shit. 
 oh, also, there will be a substantial amount of cussing throughout this review. if you care about the sanctity of your virgin eyes then shut down your computer and go do something else. we are all grown-ass adults and this is the internet. if you're going to come over and here and lecture me about swearing then i'd advise that you pipe the fuck down and stop being so bloody delicate. 
 alrighty, then. you guessed it, guys: it's story time. 
 when i was thirteen, i decided i wanted to be an author. for years i'd chattered away about being an architect or a vet or what have you, but who was i kidding? all i ever wanted to do was write. so i sat down, and i did. i did write. 
 i'm actually not shitting you. i thought it would be as easy as sitting down and writing some crap on wordpad (alright, calm down, this was the noughties) and i wrote a lot of crap: i tried to write a play, and then i tried poetry, and then i wrote short stories, before eventually expanding into novels. 
 novels is a stretch. i wrote about a hundred single-spaced pages and to my present-day horror, made my family read it. and they actually did. remember all those embarrassingly awful school projects you did when you were thirteen? or even just those embarrassingly awful things you did in general when you were thirteen? i feel the same level of shame when i think of my little preteen self, handing this pile of shit over to my sister and thinking i actually had something. 
 about a year later, with zero knowledge of how publishing works, i posted it straight into a bunch of indie publisher's slushpiles. a vanity publisher replied to me and told me they didn't want my work, and i did the undoable: i argued with them. 
 as i write this, i'm practically convulsing with embarrassment. vanity publisher, if you're reading this, please forget i ever existed. but if you can't do that, at least give me an alias when you tell all your friends about that dumb kid who sent you the book about pyromania without having done any research. 
 in some ways, having read this book, i finally feel like i identify with that vanity publisher: i read someone's irredeemable shit and hated it, but then they tried to defend it and i got so mad i broke a window with my face. 
 (peeps, if you think e.l. james hasn't tried to defend this shit, then you need to get on youtube and watch some pleading vids from the publisher.) 
 i just... 
 i haven't read a book this awful since revealing eden (but let's not open that can of worms). it was like an acid trip. am i reading this, i thought? is this actually a published book? are people actually parting with money for this slab of steaming garbage? 
 i feel like this book insulted me, really. i feel like it spat in my face, because what reader-respecting author would create a protagonist this redundant and awe-inspiringly dense, expecting an audience to love and respect her? it's as if someone took an ice-cream scoop and relieved ana of her brain. how could you...? why would you...? why is she...? 
 i just... 
 i have no words. i have no words to explain this protagonist. none at all. i have more to say about the love interest, who's like a more threatening charles manson but with only one brainwashed follower (ana). this guy goes to the hardware store and buys like chains and lime and shit and ana doesn't think this is weird? 
 what the fucking fuck? 
 and of course there's the whole ""inner goddess"" shit and ana thinking that it's sexy to wear a chunky knit sweater and be strapped into a vehicle, and then using the word ""vagina"" during a sex scene. 
 ""oh, he touched my vagina"". 
 yeah, excuse me while i tame my boner! 
 i felt so uncomfortable reading this book. now, let's be honest here: i read porn. of course i read porn. anyone over sixteen who says they've never looked at or read porn is talking out of their ass. but this book made me feel uncomfortable, and here's the kicker: i read it alone. i was reading it alone in my living room, and i felt uncomfortable inside my own head. what the fuck does that tell you? 
 i don't want to start yammering on about the way this book is written. it's written like horrendous fanfiction. there are spelling and punctuation errors, stupid turns of phrase, random asides, stilted dialogue, awful physical descriptions, weird pacing, and i don't know, like a thousand instances of brand dropping and band-naming which gives the book this bizarre cheap and dated quality that really takes away from what little redeeming features it might have had. 
 what are the redeeming features? i don't know. the blurb sounds interesting. that's about it. 
 but what is it about this book that's captured the attention of so many millions of people across the world? the absurdly stupid protagonist? the pushy, obsessive, totally unrealistic love interest? the relationship in which only one party is actually interested in bdsm, and the other is incredibly resistant to it, but is forced into it? the terrible writing? the awful cover art? the cheap, thin binding? a story so convoluted, so ridiculous, so totally immature it could only ever have been born from twilight? 
 there is nothing enjoyable about this book. this book is garbage. there are no two ways about it: it is shit. awful, awful shit. and i'm not sorry for saying so. this is my fucking opinion, and i'm damn well going to voice it. 
 this book can kiss my ass. i received an early copy of this book mysteriously in the mail. i read it in one sitting. okay, two. i have a small bladder. 
 when i was finished, i messaged the author to let her know how much i loved this book. then i ripped out all the pages that had the number three in the page number. page 3. page 13. page 23. page 33 (my fave). page 43. page 53. page 63. page 73 and so on and so forth. 
 once i had all the pages successfully torn out of the book, i proceeded to write on each of the pages in blood-red sharpie. for example, on page three i wrote ""this is how many months we were together, you jerk!"" 
 and on page 13 i wrote, ""this is how many times we fought!"" 
 and on page 23 i wrote, ""this is how many times you held my hand!"" 
 and on page 33 i wrote, ""this is how many consecutive days i cried after you broke up with me!"" 
 once i had successfully written something on each page i had ripped out of the book, i stapled them all together and mailed them to my ex-boyfriend. 
 i was arrested a week later, but i don't think that had anything to do with this book. i'm still giving this book five stars because it was really good. lance is here!!!!! 
 read on for an excerpt from pucked off: 
 i've agreed to go out with lance. on a date. two actually. i don't even know what to think. i grab my purse and slip into my jacket. as fall settles in and the temperature drops, layers are becoming necessary. 
 when i return, lance is standing at the desk, checking his phone. he's smiling. 
 ""ready to go,"" i say. 
 he hits a couple of buttons, pockets his phone, and turns that grin on me. ""cool."" 
 i lock up the clinic, and lance walks me across the lot. this time he doesn't leave the usual space between us, and the back of his hand grazes my hip. 
 i'm nervous when we reach my car. his hummer is parked right behind my mini this time. i adjust the strap of my purse and look up at him. strangely, he looks as nervous as me. 
 he scans my face and takes a small step closer. i can see his hand lifting in my peripheral vision. my hair is in a ponytail, which is sitting on my shoulder. he fingers the end of it. 
 ""why do i always want to pull this?"" 
 i don't have the opportunity to answer, because he drops his head and his lips skim my cheek. 
 ""i want to kiss you."" 
 ""you just did,"" i whisper. 
 ""i want do it again, but here."" his thumb touches my bottom lip. 
 ""oh."" 
 he's so close. his lips almost touching mine as he asks, ""can i do that?"" 
 ""yes, please."" 
 his lids grow heavy, and he kisses the corner of my mouth. lance strokes my cheek and rests his palm on the side of my neck. the other hand skims the length of my arm until he reaches my fingertips. 
 he leans back a little, and for a second i think it's over before it's even begun, but he takes my hand in his. uncurling my fingers, he lifts it and presses my palm against his cheek. a full-body tremor runs through him, and his eyes drift closed. he turns his head toward my palm, and i smooth my thumb along the contour of his bottom lip. a deep sound comes from the back of his throat, making my skin prickle and heat blossom in my belly. 
 when he opens his eyes again, the fire in them matches the heat flooding my entire body. ""can you keep yer hand right here?"" 
 ""if you want me to, yes."" 
 ""i definitely do."" 
 he leans in and brushes his lips over mine again. it's soft and warm. the next time he takes my bottom lip between his, he releases it slowly, and then does the same with the top one. when his tongue flicks out, i might whimper. light fingers cup my head, and i tilt it back farther. 
 i part my lips, and his tongue sweeps my mouth. his groan is low, sending a shiver down my spine. he drops the hand that's keeping mine pressed against his cheek. his arm winds around my waist, and he pulls me in tight against him. 
 i expect the kiss to grow in intensity. it doesn't, though i can feel the heat building inside me. that feeling i've been searching for all these years is finally back. 
 get on this crazy rise!

 kobo: http://tinyurl.com/jx62v3a i'm not sure what to write about this book. the reviews for the book were sooo incredibly misleading. i thought travis was going to hit her, or come close, the way everyone was going on about the 'abuse' in the book. i get it, it was intense. but having seen real abuse with my own eyes, in real life..i didnt understand what everyone else saw that made it be worse and stand apart from all other books. 
 this is a book about an alpha male. just because it's not a paranormal book and instead, a contemporary, it's not ok for him to act like that? i'm a pretty (very) conservative person and i've read paranormal books where the guys act worse than that. 
 abby was the one who got on my nerves the most throughout the book for jerking travis around all the time. 
 it's a book, and only a book, and i enjoyed it. i think i'll stop reading reviews before i read a book. everyone is entitled to their opinion, but i don't want to deterred from a book again. i want to make my own decision. :) and in my opinion, i loved travis! 
 great book, jamie. life is not roses all the time and everybody can change. i haven't actually read this book and i don't plan to. i was on my way to wal-mart but i took a wrong turn and ended up here at goodreads instead. i only clicked 5 stars on this book because i think that's how you get more lives on this game. i'm out of lives. someone send me some more lives! please? i'll go give some more books 5 golden stars and hopefully i won't have to start from level one again. 
 edited 7/17/17: are you f*cking kidding me? i just got a new phone and this game was deleted from my phone. i had to start over at level one. does anyone know how to get a refund on this game? ok so this is the midnight sun that twilight fans never got *trigger warning: this review contains strong themes, to include rape.* 
 before i begin what will likely become a very long rant/public service announcement, let me first say a few words. i have nothing against e.l. james. nothing. she's said that this series is a fantasy she managed to put on paper and that she never expected it to gain such momentum. good for her for perusing her dream of writing. 
 if this book also fulfills one of your fantasies, or if you just plain enjoyed it, good for you too. this review is in no way meant to belittle or condemn you for liking these books, and nor is it an attack on the author. these are solely my opinions about how dangerous fsog is to society and specifically to women. 
 needless to say, this book does not fulfill one of my fantasies. it's pretty much my biggest nightmare. 
 ""but it's just fiction!"" 
 no. you can't use that argument with me. not anymore. this book is not ""just fiction"". this book has become a frigging phenomenon. as i write this, over 70 million copies have been sold in the united states alone, hardware stores have run out of ""natural fiber"" rope and there are even 'bdsm for beginners' classes cropping up in small town america. 
 so excuse me, but i can't just read this and think of it like a fantasy, not when it's become a reality for so many people, and not when i was so enraged by what i found within it. 
 okay everyone, take a deep breath, grab a cup of coffee or a glass of wine and settle in. we're going to be here for a while. first up is probably the most inflammatory of the statements i'm going to make, so we might as well rip the band aid off. 
 this book perpetuates the rape culture we were all raised in. 
 there, i've said it. i'm not taking it back and i'm not apologizing. if you're unfamiliar with this phrase, allow me to elaborate. wikipedia defines rape culture as: 
 ""a term used within women's studies and feminism, describing a culture in which rape and other sexual violence (usually against women) are common and in which prevalent attitudes, norms, practices, and media condone, normalize, excuse, or encourage sexualized violence."" 
 let's look at the first half of that definition. as much as we may want to ignore the facts, rape and sexual violence are common in america. according to rainn, the nation's largest anti-sexual violence organization, someone in the u.s. is sexually assaulted every 2 minutes. on average that's about 207,754 sexual assaults each year. 54% of sexual assaults are not reported, 97% of rapists will never spend a day in jail and 2/3 of these assaults are committed by someone known to the victim. 
 i could go on for days about how prevalent attitudes, practices, and the media condone sexual violence, but i won't because i'm really going to try and keep my words and links relevant to fsog. thankfully, throughout my research, i found several...hundred. 
 the university of california has an interesting article about how social and cultural norms perpetuate rape and rape culture. in it, they specifically address how women are conditioned from early ages to be passive and accept and affect certain attitudes and behaviors. here are some of the social rules they list and elaborate on: 
 1. when spoken to, a woman must acknowledge the other person with a gracious smile. 
 2. women must answer questions asked of them. 
 3. women must not bother other people or make a scene because they are uncomfortable. 
 4. when in trouble, it is best to defer to the protection and judgment of men. 
 5. casual touching or suggestive comments in social settings are meant as a tribute to a woman's desirability. 
 6. it is the natural state of affairs for men to carry the financial burden of social situations. 
 7. when engaged in a social encounter, it is not proper for a woman to superior in any game, sport or discussion if she wants to be accepted. 
 8. women should always accept and trust the kindness of strangers if they offer help. 
 there's a blog post by harriet jacobs that also speaks to this and i urge you to read it in its entirety. in short, it says ""...women are raised being told by parents, teachers, media, peers, and all surrounding social strata that: 
 * it is not okay to set solid and distinct boundaries and reinforce them immediately and dramatically when crossed (""mean bitch"") 
 * it is not okay to appear distraught or emotional (""crazy bitch"") 
 * it is not okay to make personal decisions that the adults or other peers in your life do not agree with, and it is not okay to refuse to explain those decisions to others (""stuck-up bitch"") 
 * it is not okay to refuse to agree with somebody, over and over and over again (""angry bitch"") 
 * it is not okay to have (or express) conflicted, fluid, or experimental feelings about yourself, your body, your sexuality, your desires, and your needs (""bitch got daddy issues"") 
 * it is not okay to use your physical strength (if you have it) to set physical boundaries (""dyke bitch"") 
 * it is not okay to raise your voice (""shrill bitch"") 
 * it is not okay to completely and utterly shut down somebody who obviously likes you (""mean dyke/frigid bitch"") 
 now how do these two examples relate to fsog? simply put, ana, the main character in this series, continuously exhibits the behaviors listed in the rules and seems to have the mentality of those listed in the bullets. she might as well be the case study on which both were based. 
 early in the book there's an interaction between her and a young man named paul, the son of the couple she works for. this is someone she says has ""always been a buddy"". just after they greet each other with a hug, ""he releases me but keeps a possessive arm draped over my shoulder. i shuffle from foot to foot, embarrassed. it's good to see paul, but he's always been overly familiar"" 
 does she tell him that she's uncomfortable or step out from beneath his arm? no, that'd be going against everything that rule number three has taught her. plus, she wouldn't want to come across as a ""mean bitch"" now would she? 
 just after this, paul asks her out. ""whenever he's home he asks me on a date, and i always say no. it's a ritual."" is it a ritual? or is it something more than that? has ana, like many of us, been conditioned to follow the rules to such a degree that she doesn't know how to tell him ""it's not okay to keep asking me out""? is she so terrified of breaking cultural norms and coming across as a mean-crazy-angry-dyke-shrill-frigid bitch that she'll put up with his pursuit of her indefinitely? or does she just not know to put a stop to it because she hasn't been taught to? 
 when she turns him down, yet again, he goes on to say ""ana, one of these days you'll say yes."" creeped out yet? you should be. how does ana respond to this declaration? by escaping the room they're in and getting back to a crowded store floor. what does this tell us? she felt the need to flee. she felt the need to not be alone with him. part of her clearly recognized the danger of the situation and the repeated advances of her ""friend"". but instead of speaking up, she fled. 
 she never voices her discomfort. she is the submissive, quiet person that society has taught her to be. and 70 million people have read about her and have had these dangerously passive behaviors reinforced, yet again, through her actions, behaviors and words (or lack thereof). 
 how will this same mentality play out in a situation involving sexual assault? i can tell you, because just a few chapters later, she's sexually assaulted, by another of her ""friends"". 
 ""jose, i'm okay. i've got this."" i try to push him away rather feebly. 
 ""ana, please,"" he whispers, and now he's holding me in his arms, pulling me close. 
 ""jose, what are you doing?"" 
 ""you know i like you ana, please."" he has one hand at the small of my back holding me against him, the other at my chin tipping back my head. holy fuck...he's going to kiss me. 
 ""no, jose, stop - no."" i push him, but he's a wall of hard muscle, and i cannot shift him. his hand has slipped into my hair, and he's holding my head in place. 
 ""please, ana, carino,"" he whispers against my lips... he gently trails kisses along my jaw up to the side of my mouth. i feel panicky, drunk, and out of control. the feeling is suffocating. 
 ""jose, no,"" i plead. i don't want this. 
 luckily, ana is spared further abuse because the one and only christian grey arrives on the scene and saves her. how? by saying ""i think the lady said no."" that's right. ana can try to push jose away and tell him 'no' multiple times but that's not good enough. one sentence from a man and jose immediately releases her, bringing us back to rule number four: when in trouble, it is best to defer to the protection and judgment of men. you got that, ladies? don't try to fight back because you'll just be ignored, rely instead on a man. sort of a catch 22 when the one who's going to get you into trouble will likely also be a man. 
 bear in mind that this little scene takes place in the parking lot outside of a crowded bar, just a shout away from salvation. you're probably wondering why ana didn't scream. why she didn't fight harder. well, i'd like to bring up harriet jacob's blog post again because just after her ""bitch list"" she says this: 
 ""if we teach women that there are only certain ways they may acceptably behave, we should not be surprised when they behave in those ways. 
 and we should not be surprised when they behave these ways during attempted or completed rapes. 
 women who are taught not to speak up too loudly or too forcefully or too adamantly or too demandingly are not going to shout ""no"" at the top of their goddamn lungs just because some guy is getting uncomfortably close. 
 women who are taught not to keep arguing are not going to keep saying ""no."" 
 women who are taught that their needs and desires are not to be trusted, are fickle and wrong and are not to be interpreted by the woman herself, are not going to know how to argue with ""but you liked kissing, i just thought..."" 
 women who are taught that physical confrontations make them look crazy will not start hitting, kicking, and screaming until it's too late, if they do at all... 
 nobody obtains the superpower to behave dramatically differently during a frightening confrontation. women will behave the same way they have been taught to behave in all social, professional, and sexual interactions."" 
 eerie, isn't it? i sure thought so. hopefully by now you're beginning to understand the inflammatory statement this all started with. 
 not only do ana's actions and behaviors throughout the book reinforce the horrible societal conditioning that i mentioned earlier but this series also contains a lot of the other facets of rape culture, like victim silencing. for instance, once she's collected herself, this happens: 
 ""turning, i glance at jose, who looks pretty shamefaced himself and, like me, intimidated by grey. i glare at him. i have a few choice words for my so-called friend, none of which i can repeat in front of christian grey, ceo. ana, who are you kidding? he's just seen you hurl all over the ground and into the local flora. there's no disguising you lack of ladylike behavior."" 
 that's right folks. it isn't ladylike to yell (shrill bitch). it isn't ladylike to swear (crazy bitch). it isn't ladylike to defend yourself after you've just been sexually assaulted (mean bitch). leave that to the menfolk. surely they'll defend you. surely they'll be the ones to address the fact that you were just sexually assaulted. men, you know, the other sex, the ones that have been raised to talk about emotions. in public. 
 and while we're discussing this scene we can't forget about rule number eight: women should always accept and trust the kindness of strangers if they offer help. that's what christian is to her at this point in the book. a stranger. she's seen him only three times, in formal or work-related settings, and knows nothing about him other than he's rich, good looking and that his shopping list resembles those of serial killers (i'll get to that last part later in the review). but accept his help and trust his kindness she does. she lets this complete stranger remove her from the bar, assuming that as he's just saved her from a sexual assault, he's not planning one of his own. 
 when she wakes up in his suite the next morning, pantsless by the way, she accuses christian of stalking her. he defends himself by saying: 
 ""...if i hadn't come to get you, you'd probably waking up in the photographer's (jose's) bed, and from what i can remember, you weren't overly enthused about him pressing his suit,"" he (christian) says acidly. 
 pressing his suit! i glance up at christian. he's glaring at me, eyes blazing, aggrieved. i try to bit my lip, but i fail to repress my giggle. 
 ""which medieval chronicle did you escape from? you sound like a courtly knight."" 
 you got that? stalking's okay. because it's better than being raped. 
 *facepalm* 
 i'm almost at a loss at how to address the rest of this without copious amounts of swearing. how little she's concerned with her ""friend's"" behavior is appalling. that there's no thought on her end about christian's allusion to her rape escape is appalling. how she glosses over it all and makes a fucking joke about it is appalling. it continues by the way. 
 ""i would have been fine. i was with kate."" 
 ""and the photographer?"" he (christian) snaps at me. 
 ""jose just got out of line."" i shrug. 
 a shrug is a dismissive gesture, just in case you were wondering. she dismisses sexual assault as 'getting out of line'. she downplays the severity of what happened. why does she do this? because it's awkward to talk about it? because it's scary to think that someone she knows and trusts assaulted her and that when she tried to push him away and said 'no' he ignored her? guess what? it's always going to suck to talk about. it's always scary to realize that statistics say that if you're raped, you'll know your attacker. but we need to talk about these things because if we don't, nothing will ever change. 
 and now the grand finale, victim shaming and blaming. you see, jose feels bad for what he did. at first, ana is pissed at him, as she should be, and even after he calls her numerous times and leaves several messages, she continues to ignore him, deciding to ""let him stew"". then the next day, this happens: 
 ""the memory of jose's attempted kiss haunts me. i'm beginning to feel a bit cruel not calling him back."" 
 she feels cruel? she feels cruel for not returning the calls of the man that forced himself upon her? well, of course she does. she's been trained to be gracious and polite. he's addressing her. rule number one has taught her that she should smile in this situation so it would make sense that she feels bad for not doing so. 
 two days later, they talk: 
 ""can i see you? i'm sorry about friday night. i was drunk...and you...well. ana - please forgive me."" 
 ""of course, i forgive you jose. just don't do it again. you know i don't feel like that about you."" 
 here's where i start to get really angry. ""..and you..."" what exactly? were there? were breathing? had tits? how can jose's behavior in any way be blamed on ana? this is the ""she deserved to be raped because she was wearing a skirt"" mentality that needs to be burned from our collective minds. no one can ever make you do anything. everything you do, every way you behave is a choice that you and you alone make. so no, there is no ""...and you..."". 
 books like this, with scenes like the ones i've spoken about only perpetuate our silence, our ignorance, our discomfort, and our complicity. they reinforce unhealthy behaviors and thinking patterns and they perpetuate rape culture. 
 authors, i beg you, don't cover tough issues and strong themes if you can't do them justice. grant them the depth and the severity they deserve. please. 
 this review can also be found at the alliterates. i'm the author of this ya-m/new adult novel. :) rating: negative sixty septillion stars 
 it's national book lovers day! a day to bask in the amazing power of books to inform, amuse, educate, and alter our views and viewpoints. this book is my jam. jane austen is my jam. i love everything about her and this book. read this book. that is all. he's the hottest korean i've ever seen. 
 not that i have much experience with koreans, but all the ones i've encountered couldn't even be considered in the same realm as sophie's brother. 
 this is not a book for k-pop lovers. it is a book about a superior, condescending american and how she spreads her knowledge to the poor ignorant k-pop star. 
 ""she doesn't play any instrument,"" yoon jae provides. ""she just knows everything about music."" 
 ""that's not true,"" i say. but i can't help smiling at his blind confidence in me. ""i only know a few things."" 
 ""would you be interested in helping me with a new song?"" jason asks. 
 this book is the k-pop equivalent of the last samurai. let me explain. the last samurai is widely held as the movie that displays a prime example of western superiority. long story short: white guy goes into japan without knowing anything, the language, the culture, the combat styles, out-samurais all the japanese dudes, wins the heart of the fairest japanese woman in the village. 
 this book can pretty much be described in the same manner. white girl goes into south korea. not knowing the language, the customs, improves the k-pop industry, wins the heart of the hottest k-pop idol in the land. 
 bullshit. absolutely bullshit. this book displays the stereotype of the ugly american at its worst. the main character is condescending, views everything foreign as ""exotic,"" is completely unwilling to learn and appreciate the culture, and steadfastly clings onto her own standards without embracing the new. american tourists have a pretty bad reputation abroad, and the main character in this book displays no deviation from that stereotype. 
 this book mocks korean culture. from the way the people smells, to the heavy accent, to the squat toilets, to the language, to the formalities within the culture. 
 ""why are there so many different levels of formality?"" i ask jason, praying he's feeling gracious. ""i don't get it."" 
 ""it has to do with respect,"" he says, shocking me. ""you want to give respect to people who have authority over you or are older."" 
 ""okay, i get that, but seven levels? really?"" 
 he doesn't answer. 
 ""it's dumb"" pops out of my mouth before i can stop it, and i mentally kick myself. just what i need--to insult the language of the country i just moved to. 
 if you are expecting a lot of k-pop loving, as i did. be prepared for severe disappointment. 
 i don't have the nerve to tell him his music is heartless, mass-produced fluff. 
 the main character's superior attitude towards k-pop and korean music makes me want to gag. 
 ""but you think i should make it more like your american music?"" he asks. 
 ""you say that like it's a bad thing."" 
 this book made me rage. i wouldn't recommend it for k-pop fans. i wouldn't recommend it for any kind of light, summery read. it just gave me a headache. 
 as a side note: it's kind of stupid to rant about a book involving k-pop, so allow me to give myself some credibility. i've been a k-pop fan for a long-ass time. since before some of your oppas were even born. i started with shinhwa (and suffered their departure). i loved dbsk (and i witnessed with much heartbreak their departure). i fell in love with exo (and was absolutely heartbroken at the demise of exo-m...oh, luhan...;_;). 
 there may be a trend here. 
 in any case, i know my freaking k-pop. i've bopped to h.o.t's candy, and i danced along to bonamana. i attempted to do growl, but only ended up looking like a freakishly incompetent cowboy. i'm well-read on korean culture. i'm well up-to-date on k-pop current releases, and i consider myself, if not an expert, very, very well-informed on the k-pop scene. just keep me out of your flame wars. i ain't an elf, i ain't a cassie, i ain't a baby, leave me out of your drama. i'm here for the music. 
 since i'm accusing the main character of elements of racism, let me first be fair. let's address the huge fucking pink elephant in the room. korean culture, and k-pop, is not innocent when it comes to racism. i am not speaking for all koreans by any means, and i understand that every culture is guilty of feeling racially superior to some extent, but the k-pop world is peppered with racism, particularly when it comes to darker-skinned races and people. 
 this denigration of darker-skinned people is not limited to foreigners. even koreans who are darker-skinned get mocked (like the beautiful, golden-skinned kai of exo, who has been constantly given a hard time for his darker skin tone). snsd members have mocked a member whose skin is darker, calling her dirty-looking. there are rampant examples in which k-pop idols have dressed up in blackface (and nobody thinks anything of it), and there are numerous examples in which idols have made highly racist statements without any serious repercussion from society whatsoever. 
 so there you have it. racism does exist in south korea, but that's not to say we should emulate it. we should strive to be better. an eye for an eye is not the answer here. you cannot solve racism by being racist in return. 
 look, i'm not fucking mother theresa. i'm a jerk. so it should say something when i feel like we should maybe try to get along? 
 open k-pop discussion in the comments. go! 
 quotes were taken from an uncorrected proof subject to change in the final edition. finished ugly love in exactly 24 hours, couldn't put it down! so good. now i know what all the fuss is about with colleen hoover books! can't wait for the movie :) warning: f-bomb laden and spoiler ridden rant ahead. reader discretion is advised. 
 jesus fucking rollerblading christ. 
 no. fuck no. i can't do it anymore. you wanna read a historical love story with imperfect main characters? go read karleen koen's dark angels. 
 you wanna read a story about how fucked up stalin and the soviet union were pre, during and post wwii? go read the gulag archipelago 1918-1956. 
 you wanna read an in-depth history of the european campaigns of wwii? go read the guns at last light: the war in western europe, 1944-1945. 
 you wanna read a book about two of the most self-centered assholes in the history of literature? read this book. 
 we meet our female lead, tatiana, the day the nazi's invade russia. her family freaks the fuck out, like everyone else in the country does, and they immediately spring into action, sending their only son to ""safety"", other family members to get money out of the banks and their idiot youngest daughter, tatiana, to go get food to stockpile. does she understand the severity of the situation? no. she fucking reads for a little while after everyone leaves because she never gets alone time. 
 okay, so that might be understandable because the girl is sixteen and has no idea what the reality of war is like (<- this is what i told myself to keep from getting pissed). then when she finally does go to get food she starts to notice that there are lines everywhere and places are sold out of the things she barely remembers that they need. 
 imagine fucking that. 
 of course she starts to frantically run around the city in fucking high heels and a pretty dress because it was sunday and she wanted to look nice. how dafuq you gonna carry that much food in ill-fitting heels, tania? you think about that? no, no you fucking didn't. you were too preoccupied with looking pretty, you vapid little nitwit. 
 so, running around, running around. ""i have to catch this bus to get to the next grocery store in time but oh, is that ice cream?"" no. no you are not going to stop and eat fucking ice cream right now (<-this is my disbelief talking). but oh yes, yes she fucking is. because she is a self-centered asshole. 
 it's while sitting on a bench and eating her ice cream, her beautiful long blonde hair flowing around her in the summer breeze, that she meets the second most self-centered asshole in the history of literature, alexander belov. guess what? he's hot. he also saves her day by letting her into the officer's section of the grocery store so she can buy supplies to her heart's content. then he and a buddy carry them all home for her because she can't because she's in fucking heels and has blisters. 
 imagine fucking that. 
 and so begins the basis of their entire relationship. it can be summed up in one quote: 
 ""she needs me so much to take care of her... and i desperately need to take care of her."" 
 that's it. that's the entirety of this ""love"" story. it's nothing but tatiana being a fucking tstl little mary sue and alex playing the fucking white knight to her damsel in distress. 
 i know what you're thinking. 
 welp, sorry to break the news but 
 so alex and dimi, his rat of a friend, help tania bring the supplies home and lo and behold what do we discover? that the handsome soldier our female lead has been lusting after is actually dating her sister. 
 meet dasha, the only decent person in the first two hundred pages of this book (that's as far as i got). because dasha is a good person she gets completely fucked over. wanna know how??? her boyfriend and sister proceed to fall in love behind her back. 
 does alex realize what's happening and do the right thing by breaking up with her? hell no, he's a self-centered asshole, remember? he's also a fucking sadist because he parades his relationship with dasha in front of tatiana, who he secretly sees every fucking day. 
 does tatiana tell her sister what's going on? hell no, she's a self-centered asshole, remember? she's also a fucking masochist because she continues to see alex even with him dating her sister and acting like a monumental douche. 
 so that's it. self-centered asshole sadist with a hero complex meets self-centered asshole masochist with princess syndrome. they fall in love and their theme song is fuck everyone else. they'll probably dance to it at the wedding, wide smiles on their asshole faces as they fucking tango across the graves of those they sacrificed on the altar of their love. 
 this review can also be found at the alliterates. really impressed with this one! cute romance, funny dialogue, and the format/illustrations made this even more fun and unique. i also thought this book did a fantastic job at balancing the lightheartedness with the more serious stuff. personally, i could've done with a bit more resolution at the end--it felt a little rushed, and i would've liked to linger for a few more pages. also, there were some things that didn't quite add up when i stopped to think about them, but i was able to suspend my disbelief and just go with it. 
 overall, i thought this was a fantastic debut novel! funny and sad and romantic all at once! definitely recommended, especially if you like cute, unique contemporary. i finally did it!!!! and i loved it!!!! teaser scene #1---> http://bit.ly/1cpbx20

 i can't promise all of my readers will follow me down this rabbit hole, but i definitely love what i'm writing. this book has a ""i want to read it, so i have to write it"" feel just like bully did for me, so thank you for taking a chance and keeping an open mind.

 watch my interview with morgan matson here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvqhe... 
 morgan matson definitely did not disappoint with this book! filled with books, dogs, ice cream, scavenger hunts, and a swoon-worthy new romantic interest, clark, the unexpected everything was an addictive read. i love the message of this book, learning how to live in the moment, and all of the characters were strong and (some of them) easy to love. also clark. what a babe. a nerdy, beautiful babe. 
 i definitely recommend this and all of morgan matson's other books, especially during summer! why the fuck is the average rating for this book like 4.3 when i spent 75% of the book wanting to bash the stuffings out of the main love interest with a rusty one-pointed morning star? 
 but ugh. since everyone loves it, allow me to present my version of it. 
 if the duke demands - khanh's version 
 *main characters* 
 trent: duke, main love interest. stodgy and with a stick in his ass bigger than the washington monument 
 miranda: an orphan who runs an orphanage, in case the author hasn't made her life tragic enough yet. she also does things like rewrites shakespeare so that hamlet contains pirates. 19th century manic pixie dream girl 
 robert and quinn: trent's siblings and major fuckbois 
 lady jane: trent's aspired future duchess. she is very chill. perfection. like a polar pop. 
 lady diana: robert's love interest. her hair is the color of afternoon light on a field of wheat 
 act---oh, who the fuck are we kidding. let's just get on with it 
 *ahem* 
 miranda: oh my god oh my god. tonight's my chance to totally bone robert, the man i've loved my entire life. and how better to do it than to sneak into his room and seduce him? he'll totally see me as a woman then. what could possibly go wrong. 
 trent: *sighs mournfully* i am so burdened by the ducal office. it sucks. all this responsibility. and i feel such guilt, you know? because i practically killed my dad and all. and by killed my dad i mean i wasn't there to say goodbye to him after he was injured in a tragic accident that nobody could have foreseen. and to make it worse, i killed my dad/failed to say goodbye to him because i was in bed with an actress! to compensate for my failure, i will be totally perfect and marry only a respectable woman and not do shady shit like meet a chick for a tryst in her room at all. 
 miranda: **as lady rose** well, hellooooooooooo! 
 trent: damn, bitch! gimme some of that pussy! 
 *bow chicka bow wow* 
 trent and miranda: oh fuck what the fuck are you doing here? 
 trent: i've known you since you were 12. what the fuck?! who could have foreseen that at age like 19 or something that you'd be a woman and have a woman's body?! what the hell?! who could have foreseen this? 
 miranda: oh fuck oh fuck oh fuck i should have thought this through. ok, we'll both forget about this, ok? 
 trent: yeah, i mean totally. i need to find a real duchess, and totally not you, cause i know my dead dad won't approve. so how about we help each other? i'll halfheartedly help you win my brother robert, who is courting the lovely diana, whose hair is the color of starlight upon a blade of grass in midsummer. 
 miranda: deal! in return, i'll help you find the perfect duchess despite the fact that i'm a simple country girl who has no idea who the fuck is in the aristocracy and no idea how the fuck to conduct myself in the ton 
 act whatever 
 miranda: oh my god we're in town. i'm gonna flitter about being an unpredictable little lady and everyone will love me because i'm just so fucking special and delightful! 
 trent: god she's hot. how did i not realize she was so hot? but whatever, i'm here to court the lovely and cool-headed lady jane 
 lady jane: ta. 
 robert: oh my god it's lady diana, she of hair the color of spun golden candy floss upon a stick of diamonds 
 miranda: my heart, it is broken. but damn, trent is so cute. how did i not notice how cute he is? 
 trent: oh god i know i'm supposed to be helping you get my brother but hhhhhhhhnnnnnnnnnng damn girl you're hot. let me put my hands under that skirt in front of all these people at a play! let's hope nobody sees us and you won't get ruined cause i sure as hell ain't marrying you lol 
 miranda: oh, no! trent! i can't! why not, instead of doing it in front of a theatre audience, you try to finger me inside a moving carriage first. 
 trent: deal! and remember i'm not marrying you. i want lady jane. right lady jane? 
 lady jane: ta, trent. 
 trent: god. lady jane is so perfect, so lovely, so composed. but if only she responds to my caresses the same way that little improper sprite does. let me kiss lady jane and be sure. 
 **one very proper kiss later** 
 lady jane: ta 
 trent: fuck, she didn't even make me hard. 
 act who the hell cares 
 miranda: oh my god all his wandering fingers have got me feeling tingly. i know i'm not a proper duchess for him but i want to give myself to him. take me, trent! 
 trent: you know i ain't gonna marry you, bitch. but yeah, gimme that pussy. 
 *the next night* 
 miranda: oh my god i'm so stupid. how could i possibly have done that? given my virtue to someone who will never marry me and who has ruined me? whatever, let's do it again! 
 trent: yeah! get over here, gurl! you know i'm still not gonna marry you, right? 
 **the next night** 
 miranda: what have i done? i've fallen in love with him out of nowhere. the only way to cure this is by fucking him again, cause surely he'll see that i'm right for him by proving that i have self-control and that i have the miens of a duchess. 
 trent: i'm not gonna marry you, but i will have sex with you again! 
 miranda: ok. that's all i want *_* 
 **the next morning** 
 robert and quinn: oh fuuuuuuuuuuuuck trent. you're fucking miranda!!!!! yeah! yeah! you go bruh! wait, what were you thinking? 
 trent: be quiet motherfuckers. if you reveal this to anyone i'll fucking cut your balls and your allowance off. i'm just fucking her. i don't love her and will never marry her. 
 miranda: **accidentally overhears** what? *burst into tears* this is brand new information 
 trent: ....but i've been telling you this 
 miranda: *wails and runs away* 
 trent: .... 
 ugh, i'm tired. whatever, they had a happy ever after. ugh, this book. despite being a bit predictable, i adored this book. i love the characters, and i sort of want to pick it back up and read it again. i could have easily flown through this book in a day (if i'd had time), but i'm glad i took my time with it. i really got to know the characters, and i really liked the ending, and how it contrasted the beginning of the story. so beautiful. brb crying from love and heartbreak because of this book this book was...okay. it wasn't bad, it did make me laugh and giggle a bunch which saved this book for me! although, there was a major downfall for me: 
 the first 100 pages were really good! 
 the next 100 pages were slowing down and getting draggy 
 the next 219 pages went at a frustrating snails pace until finally the last page had what the whole book was leading up to. 
 i am disappointed by love, rosie because it could've been so much better if it wasn't so slow and draggy. at the end i didn't like alex as much as i did when it started, by the end he was almost like a stranger. also the book was quite depressing at times which could've been more meaningful but i found myself not connecting to it since the events that made the novel sad were given to me second hand in letters & dms. 
 i don't want to say it was a waste of my time because it was enjoyable at points but i just wish it was better since i don't read contemporary novels often so i went out on a whim with this one and was disappointed. 
 the movie on the other hand was how the book should've been written, slowly paced enough so you could fall for the characters but not so slow that you lost interest. this is definitely a case where i like the movie better than the book. 
 oh well, i am not going to like every book. 
 2.75/5 stars please someone tell me there is a second book. this one was so good but i want moreeeee! like i want to know what josh's future holds!! i want more! thoughts before reading this book: ""i wonder what this book is about?"" 
 thoughts while reading this book: ""holy hell, batman!"" 
 thoughts after reading this book: ""#j@$qiofaifjdslk%$uq#*"" 
 * this review was not paid for nor endorsed by the authors. in fact, they'd probably rather it not exist at all. how do i get over that? seriously, how on earth do i get over such a phenomenal story? 
 i'm just ::: stares into space, grasping for words::: i'm overwhelmed. overwhelmed by all i'm feeling, and all i'm thinking. i almost don't know where to start with this review. and i most certainly feel as though i just had a moment. a book moment. one where i read something that affected me so deeply, i can't even form words to describe it. 
 i mean, my first response after finishing was to release several breaths, close my eyes, and savor the moment, the journey, i had just gone on. and then i had an immediate urge to go and re-rate other books i had read in the past because this story changes the way you see things. this book pummels you in the feels. and i'm here to tell you that i have 
 major feelings 
 for this book. my feelings are so huge, so massive, so all encompassing they can barely be contained. and because of that this review is going to be long-winded and a little all over the place, so be prepared. 
 first off, before i even begin to get into things, i want to say.... i was not expecting this. i was not expecting the deep, torturous, gut you, make you cry, emotions that pucked off had in it. i mean, i am no stranger to this standalone series. i have read pucked (which i loved) and i did read pucked up (which i, unfortunately, didn't totally love and because of that i passed on lily and randy's books. that said, i do plan to go back and read those now)! so yes, i know this series, and it's always been light and sassy and kind of ott on the humor. and so, going into pucked off, i was expecting the same light feels as before... but no. just no. 
 no. no. no. no. nooooooo! 
 lance's book is deep and ache inducing and completely heartfelt. and it, from the very first sentence, steals the air from your lungs and traps you. i was literally stolen from the first chapter. it gave me a sensation of feeling fevered with the need, the urge, to know what was going to happen. only a few books have done that to me in the past, and this was absolutely in the ""group"" of reads that i would classify as unforgettable. and i think so much of that had to do with lance romero. 
 lance was one of the most breathtaking characters i have ever had the pleasure of reading. this man destroyed me. i mean, de-fucking-stroyed me! i had this clawing need to climb inside my kindle, wrap my arms around him, and love him. love him deeply and thoroughlyuntil he knew he was an amazing book soul. this man is broken. so damn broken. his past is full of demons that are haunting him. and those demon's have shaped his perception of the world, of who he is as a person, and lance is barely getting by. his view is so distorted that his destructive patterns are ripping him apart at the seams. and things are coming close to not only affecting his career, but his friendships, his life, his everything. 
 lance, though, is the definition of a book boyfriend. but not in the way you're thinking. not in that over the top, i am man, i am alpha, cookie cutter way we are used to. no, he is a book boyfriend because his struggle makes him feel real, alive. it gives him life to the reader and makes him relatable. he is simply so easy to love because at his core, this man is good. he is all things that define good. and you just can't stop yourself from falling. it's a visceral, overpowering sensation. 
 but lance doesn't see himself as anything of worth, and his behavior breaks you as a reader. when this mystery girl enters the picture, she breathes life into lance's dark world. honestly, this girl takes this book from spectacular to phenomenal. she, for me, was one of the most incredible heroines i have ever read. the way she dealt with lance, even despite the pain he had caused her in the past (and oh yeah, they have a past), was awe inspiring. she was so sweet, so generous, kind, smart and forgiving, i was enthralled by her. 
 reading lance's love story invigorated me as a reader. lance's vulnerability when it comes to this mystery woman was refreshing, and watching their relationship take shape inspired me, and it made me realize why i love reading romance. there is something so very profound about the concept of soulmates. and i feel like that is what keeps me a romance reader. the idea of having that one person that is destined to be yours and only yours. 
 i just love it. 
 and i love that sensation of falling in love as the characters fall. it's intoxicating. the way helena hunting wrote this book, i felt as though i was living it. it was palpable, visceral, tangible, like i could reach out and touch this romance, make it my own. i swear, i'm crazy in love with these characters. their love story was raw and heartbreaking, beautiful and life giving, and that was because lance's mystery girl was so good and pure, and lance, who's broken and sad and desperate, lets this woman in and allows her to inspire him to change and heal and choose a new way of living. 
 god, i hope that even makes sense, lol. but this was so much more than i was expecting and i was taken by how deep i fell in love with these characters. i truly don't know what else to say except, it's beautiful. the story is so beautiful, and i feel so romanced by it. i just want to talk about it, think about it, and live in it forever. 
 overall, you can obviously tell that i am losing my mind over pucked off. i more than loved it. it's a standalone romance. you can start the pucked series here. really, you can. and if i were you, i would. i just think out of all the books that have come out of this series, this is hands down the best. the most real and heartfelt. i give it infinite stars. i know i will always think of this book when i think of my ultimate favorites. romantic, sweet, heartbreaking and unforgettable, lance romero is the reason books boyfriends exist, and pucked off should be a mandatory read for every romance reader around. phenomenal. breathtaking. it was everything. 
 arc received in exchange for an honest review 
 follow me on: facebook | instagram | twitter | blog super cute and fun! loved the first half, but the second half felt a little all over the place. overall, it was lighthearted and sweet and exactly what i thought it would be! i read this book back before e.l. james even wrote it. 
 i don't brag about a lot of things, but my review skills are one of the few things i will brag about. 
 e.l. james read my review on this book and she loved it so much, she decided to go ahead and write the book. here is a word-for-word copy of our email exchange from that day. 
 *** 
 e.l. james: hello, colleen hoover! i saw your book review on fifty shades of grey and i loved it so much, i decided i would write the book. i'm already finished writing chapter twelve. i just wanted to say thank you. without your review, i would never have found the inspiration for this book. 
 colleen hoover: you're so welcome. i'm great at this reviewing thing, right? 
 e.l. james: you are. take care. 
 colleen hoover: laters, baby. 
 e.l. james: that's brilliant! i might put that in my book if you don't mind! 
 colleen hoover: if you do, don't give me credit for it. i don't like attention. i get so much already. someday when you finish this book, you'll know what it's like. 
 *** 
 a few months following the above email exchange, fifty shades of grey released and e.l. james became a sensational author. if you're a reviewer, make sure you pre-review books before they are written. procrastination is for losers. q: what the ever-loving fuck is this shit?! 
 a: someone's rape fantasy. 
 goddamn it. look, i'll admit, i went into this book expecting to loathe it. i hate-read every time i hit a book slump because it's the only way for me to get out of one. but i in no way expected to be this enraged. 
 let's start with the plot, shall we? the mc's brother rips off a biker gang and she's forced to become one of their sex slaves in order to save his life. yup, that's the fucking plot. oh, but it's not rape. she has a choice, you see. she can choose not to become a sex-slave...but then they kill her brother. you heard it here first! forced sex through coercion isn't rape! tell all your friends! 
 ""you want to keep dumbass alive, pack a bag and climb on my bike when we leave. you do what i tell you, when i tell you, no questions and no bitching."" 
 ""why?"" i asked blankly. 
 ""why the hell do you think?"" he said, voice strained. ""so i can fuck you."" 
 but it's not rape. 
 ""this pussy is mine. you are mine. i'll fuck you when and where i want, and you can either take it or get the fuck out. are we clear?"" 
 but it's not rape. 
 ""you do this, it's your choice. i'm not raping you. you're making a decision to pay for your brother's mistake on your back. you get me?"" 
 see? it's not rape! 
 me: 
 this epic piece of shiterature contains possibly the single worst female lead that i've ever had the misfortune to read about, marie. this chick is a horrifying amalgamation of every complaint i've ever had about every female lead i've ever hated all rolled into one insanely fucking stupid package. 
 i can honestly say that reading about this chick was like sitting in a room full of misogynistic men and listening to them tell me all the reasons that they hate women. she is the most stereotypically offensive female ever. 
 and no, i'm not fucking exaggerating. 
 the book opens with her leaving her husband because he hit her. she then goes on to slut shame the woman that he's currently sleeping with. 
 ""i liked to think of misty as the whore, which i wrote in all caps for all emphasis whenever i texted someone."" 
 let's just ignore the ""all emphasis"" portion of that sentence. this book is horribly written and edited, end of story. instead, let's focus on the definition of the word whore: ""a woman who engages in sexual acts for money."" does this woman exchange sex for money? no. so definitively, she isn't a whore. she's a ""whore"" in marie's mind because she's sleeping with her ex. 
 are you fucking kidding me? what the fuck is this thought process? instead of feeling sympathy for this woman, instead of wanting to warn her away from what will likely be an abusive relationship, you slut-shame her?! he fucking hit you! why are you angry that he's with someone else at all?! shouldn't you be elated that you escaped?! 
 way to be completely fucking brainwashed by society, way to unintentionally be the perfect fucking victim, way to continue this god-awful trend of women hating other women for no fucking logical reason, way to be a fucking bestseller and continue to perpetuate these stupid fucking trends to the masses. 
 it gets worse, by the way. marie walks into her house to find her brother nearly beaten to death and a bunch of leather-bound men standing over him, one of which holds a gun to the back of his head. any decent human being's reaction to this: 
 marie's reaction to this: 
 ""my brother knelt in the middle of our crappy living room, bleeding and awaiting execution, and all i could think about was me and horse. what the hell was wrong with me?"" 
 everything. i hate you. i hope that the bike you're about to ride on crashes and you're caught beneath it and slowly burn to death, you horrible excuse for a character. i'm sure you're thinking that goes too far, that it's a little too much. no. it's not nearly enough. i have all the rage that has ever raged. 
 before i burst a blood vessel, why don't we move on to horse, the male lead? yup, his name is horse. because he's hung like one. mmm, sexy, huh? um...no. a horse's penis can be anywhere from 2.5 - 3.5 feet long. the average woman's vagina is 3-4 inches deep but can expand to 200% when fully aroused. let's say marie has an above average vagina and is packing 6 inches of un-aroused heat. fully expanded that's still only 12 inches, a full foot and a half short, at least. i'm sorry ahead of time but all i can picture is this: 
 horse is one of the men that just beat the shit out of her brother. does he seem remorseful? no. all he seems to be concerned with is marie and her vagtastic va-jay-jay. he couldn't give a fuck about killing a man. mmm, sexy, huh? 
 *pukes* 
 jfc, what is it with all these tattooed ragebeasts? why are they a fucking thing? are we that unevolved? if you're a troll, don't even bother answering that, it was rhetorical. this book's popularity is all the answer i need. 
 so back to the matter at hand. marie's in a bit of a bind. what does she do about it? 
 a)	call the cops 
 b)	make an excuse to leave the room and call the cops 
 c)	agree to their demands only until she has a chance to call the cops 
 d)	happily agree to be horse's sex slave and never once thinks about calling the cops 
 if you answered d, congratulations, you're correct! i don't have a prize to give out but saving you from reading this failmance seems pretty good to me, so you're welcome for that. 
 marie's agreement leads us to the final thing i'd like to talk about; marie and horse's abusive abusive relationshit. let me set the scene for you concerning their fist sexual encounter. marie wakes up in bed, having no recollection of how she got there. someone has stripped her down to her panties and tank top. behind her, a boner. for whatever reason, this isn't an issue for her and she starts to fool around with - god, i can't even believe i'm typing this - horse. then this happens: 
 ""i shivered, lust and desire bursting through me, trying to see if i could lift my hips and move with him. in the process i accidentally pushed against his chest, which he apparently interpreted as me trying to push him away. 
 horse pulled away from my mouth and growled, eyes dark with desire and a need so strong i froze. he looked like an animal in heat, a point his hard prick seemed to be determined to impress in its own way. 
 ""i'm in charge here, don't forget it,"" he stated."" 
 that's right. he thinks she's trying to push him away and he doesn't respect that. instead, he gets forceful with her. marie, being the fucking idiot that she is, is fine with this. he then goes on to shove a finger up her ass without warning and then when his buddies walk into the house and she refuses to have sex with him because she doesn't want them to hear her, he punches a hole in her wall, slams her door so hard that he cracks the wood, and walks out on her. 
 she goes on to obsess about him. 
 so i'm sorry, i know a lot of people were enjoying my updates but i just can't with this fucking book. blurring the lines when it comes to sexual assault is not something that i enjoy. reading about sorry excuses for women is not something i enjoy. reading about an emotionally abusive relationship is not something i enjoy. 
 this review can also be found at the alliterates. i hate this book!! 
 i hate,hate,hate it!! 
 i thought i was prepared.and i was,to deal with a story depicting a forbidden and taboo relationship. 
 but.... 
 but i was not prepared for this!! 
 i was not prepared to encounter something so pure,so beautiful,so tormented....something so stunning!! 
 i was not prepared for him. 
 lochan. 
 ----------------------------------------------------------- 
 hello readers!! 
 i find myself utterly captivated by terrible beauty this book possesses. 
 i was disgusted.i was exploited.i wept.i screamed. 
 but i could not stop. 
 i became that proverbial moth who can't stop even though it knows it will burn. 
 and i did burn. 
 so tell me readers,how do i explain lochan to you??how do i explain something so exquisitely beautiful in a few mere words??how do i do it?? 
 i can't. 
 ---------------------------------------------------------- 
 ""at what point does a fly give up trying to escape through a closed window - do its survival instincts keep it going until it is physically capable of no more,or does it eventually learn after one crash too many that there is no way out?at what point do you decide that enough is enough?"" 
 meet kit--- 
 a 13 year old being corroded away by pain,bitterness and hatred.he does everything to refute authority.does everything to drive lochan mad. 
 meet tiffin--- 
 a beautiful,spirited young boy who has to beg for every scrap of attention from his mother.he knows that when maya tells him that their mom actually cares about them,she's lying. 
 meet willa-- 
 ""at the age of five she has already come to terms with one of the life's harshest lessons:that the world isn't fair..."" 
 and now meet with maya--- 
 a 16 year old girl who has to play the role of a mother for those three younger siblings.because their mother is too drunk and selfish to even care.and their father left them years ago. 
 the only reason she can cope with a cheerful visage....is lochan. 
 ""i can't bear to think i might have lost our closeness,our friendship,our trust.he was always so much more than just a brother.he is my soul mate,my fresh air,the reason i look forward to getting up every morning.i always knew i loved him more than anyone else in the world...."" 
 ----------------------------------------------------------- 
 yes.she loves lochan.the kind of love that has no boundaries.which is endless. 
 ""how can something so wrong feel so right?"" 
 readers,i will not try to justify their love.because no matter however i present it, it will be a difficult concept to grasp. 
 ""let's face it,this is all pretty sick.maybe the rest of the world's right.maybe we're just a couple of fucked-up,emotionally disturbed teenagers...."" 
 so no,i will not try to justify it. 
 ""there are no laws,no boundaries on feelings.we can love each other as much and as deeply as we want.no one,maya,no one can ever take that away from us."" 
 ----------------------------------------------------------- 
 and nothing prepared me for the ending.... 
 ""at what point do you give up - decide enough is enough? 
 there is only one answer really. 
 never."" 
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
 i guess that's all for now.'cause no matter what i do,i will not be able to convey the beauty of this story to you. 
 goodbye readers. 
 p.s-i love this book!! i have two copies of this book on my bookshelf. i only read one of them and i really, really loved it. but i felt bad that i was neglecting the other copy, so i decided to read it too, but i started with the last word and read the whole book backwards. i wouldn't recommend doing that, it doesn't really make much sense. and it takes longer to read the book back to front than it does front to back, because our brains aren't used to working in reverse. 
 if you read this book, which i think you should, i would highly recommend reading it front to back. oh, how i wish this book were an underground boxing match. i've had so much fun thinking up names and special fighting techniques for brooke and remington. 
 brooke ""the washout"" dumas. weighing in at an arguably lithe 120lbs., brooke's fighting style relies more on flexibility and trickery than sheer brute force. having been denied her dream of olympic gold thanks to an injury, brooke's had years to save up all her bitter rage and coil it into a tight ball of hate that she's stuffed in ""her core"". now she's wound tight and ready for action. her hobbies are babbling incessantly about inane bullshit, stretching, and making stupid decisions. turn ons are tacky tattoos, muscles, sweat, and mood swings. her special skills include an almost unrealistic ability to contort her body (she can turn her head around and kiss a guy on the mouth while in the doggystyle position), and an overabundance of vaginal fluid which she directs at unsuspecting opponents. 
 seriously, get that woman some depends before she kills someone. 
 remington ""rageturd"" tate is just your typical, musclebound gorilla. 
 ragey's actual size is never stated, but if my impressions are accurate, he's roughly the size of a small barn. left to fend for himself in the ""loony bin"" at the tender age of 13, ragey has learned how to fight, fight, fight his way to the top (of the orgy pile!). his most valuable talent in the ring is his ability to throw out super pheromone, which makes every straight female and gay male in a five mile radius stupid with lust. senses are dulled and inhibitions are destroyed. his hobbies include fighting, yelling, raging, table flipping, lamp smashing, marking his territory with his urine, and sniffing every woman of mating age in his general vicinity. his turn ons are pert butts, ""honeyed whiskey eyes"", and women with vaginal fluid imbalances. 
 the book itself has its own killer instincts. there are enough metaphors to sink a yacht, and the staccato nearly reached fifty shades levels. between that and the term ""my sex"", i was suffering some serious ""bad erotica"" flashbacks. thankfully, there was enough unintentional funny to keep me from completely losing (the rest of) my mind. some of it is funny because the bad grammar makes it weird. other parts are funny merely because someone not only thought them, but thought they were good enough to put on paper. for instance, the first named opponent of ragey is a guy by the name of kirk dirkwood. why that was so funny to me, i couldn't tell ya, but i did make a note in my kindle: ""why didn't she just go with clit dickwater?"" 
 the various story arcs are usually pretty ridiculous. in one twist, brooke sees her younger sister, nora, ""in the underground"". this occurs during a match between remington and his arch-nemesis, the scorpion. last brooke knew, nora was sending their parents postcards from australia, but alas, there she is on the scorpion's side of the ring, looking strung-out, pale, skinny...and with a scorpion tattoo on her face. 
 you know where that's going, right? well, brooke has to rescue nora from snidely whiplash, and since remington, in a manic hissy fit, bet ""all of his money"" that he'd beat scorpion in the ""underground championship""....wouldn't it just be so unbelievably sweet if he threw the match to ensure nora's release from el scorpio? 
 and now, without further ado... 
 ""my legs wobble and i'm left with the distinct impression this man wants to pound me next. with his cock."" 
 ""he's so close the scent of him tears through me like a shot of adrenaline."" 
 ""i dip my head and murmur, ""thank you"", and quickly leave, and i want to die because i swear to god he just ducked his head to smell me."" 
 ""i'm still not recovered from seeing him up close, and my blood stream already carries all kinds of strange, bubbly, hot little things."" 
 ""there is, literally, a ball of fire in my throat..."" 
 ""...and i'm so crazy about this man, i just want to eat him up with a spoon..."" 
 ""...and an entire farm full of animals awaken in my stomach, not just the butterflies."" 
 ""my head is spinning inside my cranium."" 
 ""i know. for sure. one hundred percent to the tenth power."" 
 at one point during their second sex scene, brooke reaches down and feels the slickness of his 
 ""bloated crown"" 
 . 
 there's a part where brooke goes to see her sister and has to kiss scorpion's tattoo to get permission to speak to her. well, of course his ""goons"" take photos, and of course those photos get sent to remington while he's eating breakfast in a hotel restaurant. 
 my favorite scene in the entire book in 3...2...1 
 ""i can't read his profile, but he has gone utterly still. then it all happens in a blink of an eye.""... 
 yes. he flips...a table. 
 and here's me after being introduced to a new euphemism for 'clitoris': 
 ""...and at the first scrape of my nubbin against the rock-hard quad muscle of his thigh... 
 i'll be serious for a minute. i don't understand how anyone can enjoy writing like this. i struggled to get through. the writing was simplistic, repetitive, and amateur, the dialogue was silly, and the corn and cheese quotient went well beyond what anyone would count as acceptable. there were moments when ms. evans just abandoned any pretense at actual storytelling. there are at least four instances where the story almost completely self-destructs, and the book left me with more questions than it answered: 
 1. did brooke tear her acl twice or break her ankle? 
 2. is pete's name pete or pedro? 
 3. was the tension between melanie and riley because they hadn't slept together yet or because they had? 
 4. did melanie go home without us being told? one minute she's there, the next she's not. 
 5. why did remington, after an entire books' worth of silence about his feelings, go off for five fucking pages at the end about how much he lurves brooke? 
 6. if a scorpion is an insect, why does brooke refer to the scorpion as ""the reptile man""? 
 7. what the hell happened with remington's parents? they showed up to see him, but he refused, and we never revisited that messy topic. 
 8. how did nora manage to get rid of her tattoo and beat a cocaine addiction in a mere four weeks? 
 9. how is it possible for one man to spend a few million dollars a year? what is he spending all that money on? 
 10. he told brooke he wants to be her ""real"". her real what? real vagey boyfriend? if so, mission accomplished. 
 11. why was there so much poetic waxing about how utterly perfect and god-like and sexy and male and sweet and vulnerable and damaged and fuck! why?! 
 questions, questions, questions. the most burning question, however, is how in the name of blackbeard's glory hole has this gotten so many high ratings????

 ""nubbin"" - 2 okay... i realized by people's comments that i never said exactly what i thought about this book. well, i loved it. i've now read it four times. christian grey ranks right up there with travis maddox in my book boyfriend world. this series is addicting. when i need a good read this is my ""go to"" series. i didn't know what to think about this because i wasn't sure how i felt about bdsm... but this is sooooo much more than that. one of the best love stories i've read to date. oh my goodness. i don't think i'll ever be able to say it's better than the mortal instruments . . . but wowwww was this book absolutely amazing! 
 this book was absolutely phenomenal. i think it is some of cassandra clare's best work to date. to the people who say all of cassie's books are the same, i hope lady midnight finally shuts you up. no more stories about ""orphaned girls who aren't aware of their supernatural powers."" (p.s. clary was never an orphan so i don't know why i keep seeing that associated with tmi?) it was so wonderful to jump into the shadow world from a perspective we've never seen before. here's a girl who's been a shadowhunter all her life, who grew up with all of the customs we're so used to learning about throughout the past books, who's already lived through a war and survived. even though it's the same world, it is so unbelievably different from anything i've read from cassie before. given, some of that may have to do with the fact that this is the first totally new and full novel i've read from cassie clare in 2014, but i do believe most of it is attributed to the fact that she's grown as a writer and story teller. 
 from page one of this book, i can already sense a level of sophistication and improvement in her writing. there's an unfamiliar level of seriousness i haven't seen in the shadow world before. it's intense, it's insane, and it's real. the characters in this book seem way more grounded than our beloved tmi/tid cast. i think some of that may have to do with the fact that there aren't jokes 24/7 (thought the comedy in this book is a+!) but each character is extremely individual and realistic in my opinion. i love absolutely all of them. it was so strange to start a book knowing quite a bit about this group of characters before starting; that's a totally new experience for me. 
 i will say, this story was a bit slow to start. the first 100-200 pages were kind of slow, but i think it was more just getting used to a new world with new characters and a new story. as soon as the book picked up, i couldn't put it down! from there on, this book is a non stop thriller with everything you could possibly want from a new installment of the shadowhunter chronicles. 
 lady midnight has taken the shadow world further than i've ever imagined. i can't remember ever having so many theories for a series, and i am just exploding with all of the new information that's revealed to us. i'm halfway through the book, thinking to myself, ""i need queen of air and darkness now because i cannot wait until 2018 to know the truth!"" this story went in so many directions i wasn't expecting at the start, and i'm dying to see how things play out in the rest of the trilogy. 
 that being said you definitely need to read all of cassandra clare's works prior to this because we get all the tmi and tid feels. if there's one thing i love about cassie's books, it's the way she's able to throw in references of our favorite characters so subtly and endlessly give us the satisfaction we desire from her previous books. but that means for those of you who aren't totally caught up yet, stay away because the spoilers are everywhere. 
 all in all, this book was absolutely fantastic. i never realized how much i wanted from this book, and cassie managed to fulfill all of those unconscious desires i had for the future of this world. i can't remember the last time i loved a first book in a series this much. if that review hasn't sold you, i hit page 668 and turned directly to page one to start all over again. lady midnight was absolutely phenomenal. i'm so proud of cassie for never failing to disappoint me, always being an insanely talented writer, and continuing on with a world i know is so dear to her heart. i hope you all absolutely adore lady midnight as i did, and i cannot wait to post the spoiler-filled discussion i have prepared for my youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/emmmabooks. happy reading my fellow shadowhunters <3 
 *disclaimer- i was sent an advanced copy of this book by simon & schuster in exchange for an honest review. all opinions included in this review as well as my future video are entirely my own.* 3/4! last kiss, book 2 of 2. the shocking conclusion & unraveling of reeves sallis & emily's cat-and-mouse game of seduction! 
 ""i put myself back together as best as i could, but i was sure that parts of me were broken permanently."" 
 books in first and last series should be read in order: 
 book 1: first touch 
 book 2: last kiss 
 in first touch (book 1) actress and tv sitcom star emily wayborn aka emily barnes sought out heir and hotelier with rumored mafia ties, reeve sallis. in hopes of seducing the truth out of him regarding her friends disappearance. 
 but emily quickly became entwined, in over her head, with reeves' cat and mouse game of seduction falling for him while getting mixed signals and finding little proof of his innocence. 
 last kiss (book 2) opens up to book 1's jaw-dropping ending. recent shocking developments has emily torn between her past and her future; right and wrong; fear and courage; love and hurt; holding on or letting go.... 
 it's a roller-coaster of mixed messages, danger, conflicted feelings, cover-ups, misunderstandings, addiction, manipulation, confusion, betrayal, deceit and ultimately truths... 
 reeve sallis has come a long way since book one. emerging is a matured refined alpha ready to face his past and claim his future. nine words to describe reeve: larger-than-life, elusive, suspicious, commanding; intense, ruthless, moody, private and unyielding. 
 nine words to describe emily wayborn aka emily barnes: smart, determined, self-doubting, trusting, confused, wishy-washy, reflective, meek and resilient. 
 last kiss, from emily's pov, is the suspenseful unraveling of a mystery and the final pieces in the puzzle of the enigma that has been reeve sallis. 
 it's addicting, frustrating, shocking, angsty and... deceiving! but above all it's living for the moments and basking in the glory of reeve sallis. the ending is peace and healing but i'd welcome an epilogue a few years into their future. 
 jaded, devious, enigmatic and panty-melting reeve sallis! complex and suspenseful plot! excellent story-telling! i am sticking reeve on my top-10 hero shelf! 
 ""a kiss that couldn't fade. 
 a kiss that could go on forever. 
 a kiss that could last. 
 instead of what it really was--a last kiss.""

 would i recommend this series: yes. 
 would i re-read this series: yes. 
 would i read future books by this author: yes. 
 arc provided to me by author laurelin paige in exchange for an honest review. so there's this popular girl. her name is, like, gia. she's 17 but has this totally hot junior boyfriend at ucla whom nobody has seen (statutory rape is so, like, 2000s, which, incidentally, is practically the year in which gia was born). she got hot bradley to take her to prom, only, like, at the last minute (literally in the parking lot, y'all) he dumps her. 
 why? because she's a shallow bitch and only cared that hot bradley was, like, totally hot, and her friends are gonna be, like, so impressed. especially that bitch, jules, who's like, trying to totally steal away all her friends. because gia is the alpha of their group and we can't have that. no, really. she's the alpha, and that status is endangered. 
 nice friends you got there."" 
 ""they're mostly nice. jules is just constantly trying to oust me."" 
 ""why?"" 
 ""i have no idea. i think she thinks i'm the alpha of our pack and that there is only room for one without resorting to cannibalism."" 
 but she's not such a bad queen bee, really, gia and her friends only: 
 1. completely disregard anyone beneath her social spectrum 
 ""hi. i'm sorry. i don't know your name."" 
 he shrugged. ""i've only been in four of your classes over the last three years. why would you?"" 
 my cheeks reddened. had he really? i looked at him again, closer. he honestly didn't look at all familiar to me, except from prom the other night. 
 2. slightly teases her close friends who aren't up to her standards. she never bullies. that's, like, so low-class. 
 ""who needs money and good grades when you have community college?"" claire said. 
 ""exactly what i've been saying for the last four years,"" laney said. i could hear the embarrassment in her voice and i felt bad that school had been a struggle for her. 
 such condescension! such benevolence! such pity! she is the equivalent of lady catherine in pride and prejudice! 
 so, after suffering from the most horrible fate possible in the entire world (on prom night), gia is shit out of luck. but luckily for her, there's a totally hot guy just sitting in his car, ripe for the plucking. and pluck she does. she sweet-talks fake bradley into being, well, fake bradley, and taking her to prom instead. 
 he takes her to prom. her friends are understandably impressed, because really, which high school girl is going to think about statutory rape when the guy is, like, so hot. except the girl who's trying to steal her friends, cause she's all, like, smirking and scowling that her plans to take all the friends have gone to pieces. 
 for now. *sinister smile* 
 i wrapped my arms around claire and glanced at jules. surprisingly, she wasn't looking at me. her stare was focused on the door that fill-in bradley had just exited through. there was that familiar calculating look on her face, and i wondered what was going through her mind. i was sure of one thing--it wasn't good. 
 so prom night goes swimmingly, and she even gets to conveniently break up with fake bradley at the end of it, which is great, except now, for some reason, gia is really, really fascinated by fake bradley. if only she could find out fake bradley's real name. and then real bradley resurfaces, and maybe he wants to make up again? 
 oh, gosh, what's a girl to do? clearly, gia has some #realproblems. and her archnemesis jules is trying to expose everything via facebook, and twitter, and instagram. 
 she pulled out her phone. ""oh, and while i'm online, i wanted to leave mean messages on bradley's facebook page for what he did to you. what's his last name again?"" 
 here it was--her play. i was surprised she had waited this long. ""he isn't on facebook. who goes on facebook anymore anyway?"" he actually was on facebook, but there was no way i was telling her that. 
 ""so instagram? twitter? you showed me them before but i don't remember his handle,"" she pushed. 
 obviously she forgot tinder, and maybe grindr. possibly pinterest and yo, too. gotta cover all the bases, y'know. 
 but let's not get facetious. gia's got some serious problems. 
 i mean, she has to: 
 1. find fake bradley 
 2. get fake bradley's sister (who goes to the same school with her, whom she didn't know went to the same school, much less class with her, see note above about gia not giving a shit about anyone outside of her hallowed social circle) to give her fake brad's real name 
 3. decide what to do about real bradley 
 ""how is bradley anyway?"" he gave me a sideways glance. 
 ""i don't know. i haven't talked to him since that night."" i'd been telling too many lies lately, so i felt the need to add, ""he texted me. i tried to call him back and he didn't answer. then he called me back but i missed it. then i left a message for him. i haven't decided if i'm going to call him again."" 
 4. try to prevent jules from knocking her off the #1 queen bee (sorry, alpha) in her circle of friends 
 5. decide what to do what real bradley and fake bradley meet each other 
 her family only looks perfect. her dad is understanding, caring. her mother is beautiful, intelligent. her brother is a little distant. she's got some serious problems. 
 ""what about you? are you close with your family?"" 
 ""yes,"" i said right away, but then i paused, drew's words about how my parents hadn't really been there for me after i broke up with bradley coming into my mind. i shook my head to get rid of the thought and then nodded. ""yes."" 
 there is so much suffering. so much hardship. i can think of a thousand examples from the book in which her family is distant, cruel, uncaring. oh, wait, i can't. they're pretty much white-bread perfect. 
 clearly, you can see this book contains as much depth as is contained within kim kardashian's ample cleavage. 
 actually, now that i think about it, that's pretty deep, yo. empece esta novela por la polemica y porque queria formarme mi propia opinion. bueno, pues ya lo he hecho, y aqui esta. ni siquiera voy a poner puntuacion, porque creo que lo que pienso ya ha quedado lo suficientemente claro por mis comentarios. me parece que esta mas a nivel de fanfic que de novela, y podria haber mejorado muchisimo si alguien hubiera revisado los errores de estilo y las incoherencias (de argumento, de contexto, de personajes...), porque no habria estado mal. o tan mal. sin embargo, y siento decirlo, este libro es un desastre. 
 no me voy a extender con como esta escrito (mal, nada unificado) ni de ritmo (*rolleyes*) ni de la trama que no lleva a ninguna parte (*inserte el meme de la negra*), porque paso. ya se ha dicho y volver sobre eso me parece un rollo. ademas, estoy segurisima de que hay gente muchisimo mas indicada que yo para hablar de esas cosas, porque no soy ninguna experta. eso si, me voy a centrar en la historia en si, en las escenas, en las cosas que he leido. porque hay muchas cosas que decir que estan mal, y lo siento pero no puedo aguantarme. 
 aviso: no me voy a cortar un pelo, esto esta lleno de spoilers. 
 para empezar, no solo creo que falta trabajar los personajes, sino que habria que haberse documentado un poco en cuanto a las enfermedades que tratan y lo que suponen tanto para los que las sufren como para los de su alrededor. entiendo que en una historia hacen falta dramas en los que apoyarse (hola, soy yo, todas mis historias tienen drama por alguna parte y ademas del intenso), pero es que en este libro podrias quitar tranquilamente lo del padre, lo de la hermana y lo de la madre de eric y el resto permaneceria intacto. emma seguiria siendo la misma, y la parte que para las autoras es claramente la mas importante de su libro (el avance como bloguera de emma y la relacion con eric) no se alteraria. si te quieres apoyar en eso, por lo menos hazlo bien. os juro que me ha parecido que ni las autoras tenian claro lo que le pasaba al padre, en plan, si, bueno, no se puede banar solo ni leer ni hablar, pero ya. y lo de la anorexia que se cura milagrosamente despues de que una nina de nueve anos (que entiende perfectamente lo que es la anorexia, claro, porque si no es algo dificilisimo de entender para algunos adultos no lo va a ser para alguien de esa edad) llore junto a la cama de la hermana pidiendole que por favor vuelva..., en fin. me callo. el caso es que estas hablando de cosas muy serias, y tienen que tener una repercusion clara en la personalidad de la hija/hermana que ha tenido que vivir con las secuelas de aquello. ?la tiene? no. emma se comporta con su padre como si fuera un senor extrano a quien le han encargado cuidar y claramente se la suda que su hermana tuviera anorexia, porque la saluda con un <<?has adelgazado?>> y se queda tan ancha. 
 se ve que emma es una persona comprensiva y entregada, eh. es una luchadora y responsable y ""una empollona"". o a lo mejor eso ultimo tampoco tanto, porque esta en 2o de bach y a) se salta clases para estar con el malote de turno, b) se pasa horas leyendo libros (muchos, muchos libros, y te los dice todos) en vez de estudiar, c) pasa tardes enteras viendo videos de yt porque no debe tener nada mas que hacer. uhm, no hace tanto que hice 2o de bach y no tenia tiempo ni para mear. tendria que haberme contado su secreto. 
 pero espera, que emma saca notazas en la pau despues de haber estado tocandose el papo todo el curso, saliendo con moteros y liandose con booktubers. olvidad el parrafo anterior, no he dicho nada. chicas, dejad los estudios por un tio y otras distracciones, que total la selectividad es muy poco importante y puedes sacar notazas estudiando dos dias antes. 
 por otra parte, esta la relacion de eric y emma. o mejor decir instalove, termino que he leido hace poco por ahi y me ha encantado. no tiene sentido ninguno. para empezar, todos sus primeros encuentros son en plan mal (el de la biblioteca, el de la innecesaria clase de literatura, el de la fiesta a lo americano). se ha hablado ya de la escena de la hierba y que el la toquetea sin su permiso y cuando el poli le pregunta si hay algun problema ella dice que no, que todo esta bien, pero aun asi quiero hablar de ella; ?soy la unica a la que si se le acerca un desconocido le apartaria de un empujon preguntandole que cono hace? en serio, pensadlo. literalmente le acabas de ver hace cinco minutos. me la suda que sea guapo. es que es acoso, joder. y te esta toqueteando, casi besando. que me estas contando, tio. 
 ah, por cierto. la tia le encuentra la hierba y se cabrea con ella, pero cuando la hermana le cuenta que ""el poeta"" es guapo se le pasa. se le pasa. porque es guapo. 
 en fin. el caso es que sus primeros encuentros son en ese plan y despues el desaparece entre septiembre y abril (?????) y, al parecer, la vida de emma y su familia no es lo suficientemente interesante sin eric pululando por ahi como para hablar de ella. el vuelve de repente, emma esta preocupadisima por el porque debe ser que en sus primeros encuentros fue amabilisimo con ella y le recuerda con carino (pista: en realidad es que es muy guapo), y va a hablar con el. pasan cosas en las que los dos estan en su linea de antes, el la besa asi porque why not y ya esta enamorada. da igual todo lo que ha pasado porque, como le dice un amigo de eric a emma, <<si se comporta asi contigo es porque en el fondo le importas>> (hello, it's me, your old friend feminismo knocking at the door). mira, no. lo siento, pero no. aunque da igual. el sigue siendo borde con ella, emma le cuenta el accidente de sus padres out of nothing (juro que estaban hablando de otra cosa y de repente ella se lo suelta asi sin mas, wtf) y en algun momento que debi perderme lo suyo se hace oficial, pero el caso es que pasa. tralala. 
 oh, y luego esta la primera vez que lo hacen, la primera vez de emma. es sin proteccion. o sea, si, ella le coge un condon a la tia, pero no se dice que ella lo saque ni que el se lo ponga ni nada, porque oh ella se emociona demasiado y se calienta y en fin, la pasion del guapo de eric. ella le ha visto estar con varias chicas, chicas con las que esta casi segura que eric ha hecho cosas mas alla que morrearse, y aun asi decide que su primera vez con el va a ser sin proteccion porque debe ser que las ets son un mito. bye. 
 dos dias despues, cortan. ni siquiera discuten nada, ella deja de hablarle y hale. justo para que emma pueda conocer a su booktuber mexicano favorito, por cierto, tambien de personalidad poco consistente (creo que es el tipo de chicos que le gustan a emma, visto su historial) y salido directamente de una telenovela, guey. el chaval se hace mazo amigo suyo en una noche y al dia siguiente le dice ""venga, que como me conozco madrid te acompano a esa estacion que esta a tomar por culo"" y, como todos los hombres que se ha cruzado emma ultimamente, la besa sin consentimiento. como dice mi amiga jasmina, libres domingos y domingas. sinceramente, no entiendo por que se sigue romantizando tanto esto. no me entra en la cabeza. no es algo bonito, es incomodo y agresivo. las chicas adolescentes no deberian estar esperando eso. ?por que no puede empezar a verse mas normal un <<?puedo besarte?>>, <<si>>? yo he vivido eso y, tio, es mucho mas bonito. se te ponen mariposas en el estomago y la anticipacion y todas esas cosas que dice que siente emma. por no hablar de cuando ella empieza a tener dudas sobre eric y cada vez que gabriel la besa (y lo otro) se siente superincomoda, lo dice, pero no se aparta. pf. que por cierto, sobre el ?triangulo amoroso?, sin comentarios. otra cosa que se fuerza para poner ""trabas"" en la relacion de ellos dos; aparece porque si y desaparece porque si. y ya esta. todo bien. 
 detalles como que las puertas de los hospitales tiene una ventana para que veas al paciente (again, ?en que hospital de madrid, por favor?), que una adolescente vaya al videoclub (?no tienes netflix, hija mia?) o lo de que al principio de curso monten una fiesta con dj en el gimnasio del instituto (me pregunto si los vasos eran rojos y si habia ponche) son cosas que, si se hubieran solucionado a tiempo, le habrian dado menos aspecto de fanfic-de-wattpad. son fallos de ambientacion de primero de escritura, no se. y luego lo de la blc y los libros que lee emma. dios. tenia que haberme informado de a cuanto estaba la mencion. que lo haga una vez hace gracia, un par vale, pero ?todo el rato? venga ya. 
 y ya por ultimo: el gran misterio. lo que hace que eric sea un chico malo. lo de que condujo borracho y tuvo un accidente en el que se mato su novia. cuando emma le dice <<no es tu culpa>>, os juro que me he puesto a gritar. ?como que no es su culpa, si se emborracho y cogio la moto y tuvo un accidente que la mato, que me estas contando? os juro que no me lo creo. lo leia y me parecia imposible que alguien pudiera disculpar a alguien asi, sobre todo despues de que emma repita una y otra vez que eric es el tipo de persona que mato a su madre. no tiene puto sentido. que me estas contando. 
 en fin, no hay mucho mas que decir. lo he leido, como ya he dicho, porque queria tener mi propia opinion. y aqui esta. siento si el tono que he usado ha ofendido a alguien, pero dentro de lo que cabe todo lo que digo me parece serio, fallos importantes. si tanto hablamos de feminismo, historias toxicas, topicos y etc, tal vez deberiamos tener en cuenta ciertos puntos antes de sacar algunas cosas al mercado, que luego mucho criticamos otras novelas pero la nuestra no. vamos a ser coherentes, por favor, y a revisar y aprender de los errores. a ver si va a ser que el emperador si que esta desnudo, ?no? 
 pd: ninguna profesora de literatura de instituto te va a decir que lo que lees es una mierda, ni que la literatura juvenil es para ninos. para empezar, es una profesora y sabe que es la literatura juvenil, aunque creas que no. lo sabe. no ha nacido ayer. segundo, entiende el termino juvenil a la perfeccion, porque da clase a gente de 16-18 anos. si te manda leer la celestina es por otra cosa, no porque sea el unico libro que conoce. y, para acabar, es una profesora de literatura. le gusta que leas. le gusta que te guste leer. no te va a decir que no lo hagas. en serio que no. **down shift is as a complete standalone novel** 
 getty and zander.

 she is running from her past. 
 he is running from the truth. 
 both need time alone. 
 both want solitude. 
 both hope to make peace with their demons. 
 who knew an unexpected meeting in the sleepy town of pineridge would be exactly what each of them needed? 
 you may have met zander briefly in the driven series but in down shift you get to know the man he becomes. he's stubborn. sweet. arrogant. understanding. protective. broken. real. 
 and then there's getty. she's strong. determined. wounded. feisty. courageous. she's all of those things and yet she doesn't quite see it yet. or believe it. 
 but zander does. and he's determined to make her see it. to make her believe it. 
 yet sometimes seeing isn't always believing. zander knows that truth better than anyone. that's why he's in pineridge after all. 
 but demons have a way of finding you no matter how far you run from them. will zander and getty face them together or will the truths revealed tear apart the trust and peace they've found in each other? bully was my love.

 see the reader-made trailer!!

 omfg!! may is seriously too far away right now and i need book two right now!! i highlighted about 90% of this book and it was virtually impossible for me to decide on which quotes to use because the entire book was freaking quotable!! 
 i fell in love with k.l. kreig's writing when i read black swan affair. the writing was smooth, beautiful, eloquent, poignant and evocative and part of me felt that that 5-star read was some sort of fluke. well, that theory was quickly quashed when i got lost in the story of lost in between. 
 it didn't take long for me to become absorbed by the chemistry and connection between shaw and willow. they were both commitment-phobes, but the electricity that buzzed between them strongly tested their resistance. what started as a business arrangement soon turned into something deeply personal and intimate. there was only so long that these two could deny themselves what they instinctively wanted: each other. 
 fair warning readers: this story is not only heartwarming and profound, it's a freaking panty scorcher. although this tale was sweetly romantic with contemporary flair, the sizzling scenes between shaw and willow were hot enough to tantalize even my erotic sensibilities. so freaking hot!

 genre: contemporary romance 
 pov: dual - 1st person 
 steam: 4.5 out of 5 
 book type: book one of the finding me series 1/2! chandler (stand-alone book 5). chandler's funny, sexy & endearing fall into whipped! 
 ""i, however, pretend like sucking on her tits is no big deal. spoiler: it is. i'm fucking lead."" 
 chandler (stand-alone, book 5) opens up to life as usual for playboy chandler pierce. growing up with a silver spoon in his mouth, yet the black sheep of his family, he has opted for a position in his family empire without applying himself. in the dating department he learned early on to guard his heart and becoming a manwhore. 
 heiress and college graduate, genevieve fasbender, genny has grown up in the shadows of her brother. yet she is still yearning for her father's attention. meeting the charming chandler pierce proves mutually beneficial with them letting off some steam and enjoying a couple multiple orgasms before parting ways. 
 but their no repeat sex policy is quickly compromised with more mind-blowing sex against walls and furniture. add to that a friendship of sorts with chandler, against his better judgment, inviting genny to his family vacation home for the weekend... this cannot be wise! 
 i just loved chandler pierce's inner voice, the contradiction of the man the world saw or wanted to see and the man he truly is. eight words to describe chandler: charming, endearing, noble, funny, dejected, blunt, jokester and vulnerable. 
 seven words to describe genevieve fasbender, genny: private, secretive, ambitious, flawed, naive, easy-going and smart. 
 chandler, told from chandler's pov, is indeed one man's fall into whipped. but sexscapades aside, it also a story about finding your place; two lost souls, who are perfect for each other, if only they could see that themselves. it ends on a high with a sweet and comical epilogue! 
 hilarious moments! endearing inner dialogue! feel-good! sexy! 
 ""considering the current turn of events-i.e. my fingers fondling her pussy-i'm optimistic that a blowjob could be brought to the table for negotiation.""

 would i recommend this series: yes. 
 would i re-read this series: maybe later. 
 would i read future books by this author: yes. 
 arc provided to me by author laurelin paige in exchange for an honest review. okay, with roughly 100 pages to go, i think i've read enough. i just couldn't finish this book and find myself very disappointed that ms. day created her own story based on the wildly popular e.l. james book, ""fifty shades of grey."" sure, christian grey is now, ""gideon cross"" (i'm not a rocket scientist, but i figured out the initial exhange - along with changing ""ana"" to ""eva."") but here's where i'm baffled: ms. day is actually a good writer. there's a reason i read as many pages as i did. because of that fact, with each turn of the page, my heart sank for her. 
 without going into the meat of this story, if you've read fsog, you essentially already know it. yes, the people, places and situations have been jumbled around a bit, but for the most part; (and it pains me to say it since this story had such great potential), someone should have waved a red flag in day's direction long before it was published. 
 this is the first review where i am at a loss for words... warning: this review contains a discussion of the c-word, and i plan to use it. please don't read this if you do not want to see the word spelled out. thanks. 
 this is less a review than an homage to my crazy mother (now i have you really intrigued, don't i?) 
 it was 1983, and i was in my first catholic school. i'd spent my first six years of school in a public school, but my ""behavioral issues"" coupled with my lack of growth made me a target for bullies, so my parents were advised to move me to another school where no one knew me. 
 so off i went to the home room of a fallen nun, who'd given up her habit for a family. she wasn't much of a teacher. she was an old school catholic educator who practiced punitive teaching, which included kicks to the shins, yanking of ears, pulling of hair, and screaming from close range. 
 i kept my head down and tried to blend in with my new surroundings, but my mother made that difficult from the get go. i was a voracious reader, and she passed on the disease to me. from grade two on she had been recommending great books to me. i was reading everything before most everyone else, but my mom's recommendation of lady chatterly's lover in my first month of catholic school was probably her most outrageous and unforgettable recommendation. 
 she bought me a copy at the book store in the mall, and that's where i met one of my favourite words of all time -- cunt. 
 back in 1983, cunt was not a word in your average child's vocabulary. sure we'd heard it, and maybe even seen it, but it was not something that was regularly used by kids, and its usage was pretty vague to every 13 year old i knew. 
 but there it was in lady chatterly's lover. it was all over the place. so as i read the story and absorbed the way lawrence used cunt, his usage became my usage. lawrence used cunt beautifully; it was not a term of denigration; it was not used to belittle; it was not an insult nor something to be ashamed of; cunt was lyrical, romantic, caring, intimate. and i came to believe that cunt was meant to be used in all these ways. that the poetic use of cunt was the accepted use of cunt, the correct use of cunt, and suddenly cunt was part of my vocabulary. 
 i was thirteen. 
 now i didn't just start running around using cunt at every opportunity. i did what i always did with new words that i came to know and love. i added them to my vocabulary and used them when i thought it was appropriate. 
 and when i whispered it to tammy, the girl i had a crush on, a few weeks later, thinking that it was the sort of romantic, poetic language that made women fall in love with their men (i can't remember what i said with it, but i know it was something very much like what mellors would have said to constance), she turned around with a deep blush, a raised eyebrow and a ""that's disgusting"" that rang through the class (i can still see the red of autumn leaves that colored her perfectly alabaster skin under a shock of curly black hair, aaaah...tammy. apparently she had a better sense of cunt's societal taboos than i did). mrs. c--- was on her feet and standing parallel to the two of us in a second, demanding to know what was going on. 
 to her credit, tammy tried to save me -- sort of. she said ""nothing."" then mrs. c--- turned on me; i was completely mortified (i'd obviously blown it with the first girl i loved in junior high school), and while i was in this shrinking state, mrs. c--- demanded to know what was happening and what i had said. 
 i tried to avoid repeating what i had said. i admitted i shouldn't have been talking. i admitted that i should have been working. i tried to divert her attention. but she was a scary lady, and i couldn't help myself. i repeated what i had said -- as quietly as i could -- but as soon as mrs. c--- heard ""cunt"" i was finished. that was the moment i knew ""cunt"" was the catalyst for the whole debacle. 
 now...i'd known before that the word was taboo, but i didn't think it would generate the response it did. i really thought that tammy would be flattered. and i certainly didn't expect that i would be dragged to the office by an angry ex-nun. silly me. 
 i got the strap. it was the first time (although there would be another). three lashes to the palm of the hand. 
 i didn't use ""cunt"" in public or private for a long time after that, but my punishment couldn't diminish my love for the word. lawrence made such and impression on my young mind that neither humiliation nor physical pain could overcome my appreciation of cunt's poetic qualities. 
 to me the word is and always will be a beautiful and, yes, gentle thing. 
 every time that event was recounted at the dinner table over the years, whether it was amongst family, or with my girlfriends or my future wife, my mom always got this sly little grin on her face and indulged in a mischievous giggle before refusing to take the blame for me getting the strap. after all, ""who was the one who was stupid enough to use the word, brad? not me."" 
 i love her response as much as i love the word. 
 and in case you were wondering, my mom never stopped recommending books to me. she was an absolute kook. i miss her. 
 i can't wait to pass on lady chatterly's lover to my kids...but i think it's going to have to be in grade three if it's going to have the same effect it had on me...hmmm...i wonder how that will go over. girl online on tour was a definite improvement compared to the previous novel. i don't like noah but i do really appreciate all the important themes penny talks about in this book such as anxiety and standing up for yourself. although very predictable, it wasn't a bad read (just not the best). warning: i've been drinking. 
 *hiccup* 
 you know- 
 *gestures with wine glass* 
 *sloshes some over the side* 
 i mean, this book- 
 *licks wine off fingers* 
 *tries to refocus* 
 what was i saying? oh, yeah. this fucking book, man. 
 *takes another sip* 
 there's damen. a prince betrayed by his bastard of a brother. sold into slavery to an enemy nation. 
 *stumbles up to standing* 
 and do you know what? you know who he's fucking sold to? 
 *raises voice* 
 to an even bigger bastard than his brother! 
 *sits back down* 
 a prince named laurent. who may or may not be the best written ""villain"" i've ever read. he's as beautiful as he is brilliant. as manipulative as he is sadistic. as enigmatic, as... 
 *hiccup* 
 i hate his face. i want to do terrible things to him. dirty, lascivious, debauched, terrible, terrible things. 
 *wanders off in search of appropriate meme* 
 ah-ha! found one. 
 the world surrounding these characters is just as harsh. brutal, seductive, violent, depraved. i want to write myself into it with a sword and carve my vengeance from the flesh of damen and - god help me - even laurent's enemies. 
 *brews pot of strong coffee* 
 *hiccup* 
 *starts second book* 
 this review can also be found at the alliterates. i'll be filming a review on my channel. stay tuned! i can't even. i would like 409 pages of my life back. 
 (watch my full review:) 
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssib8... am i the only one creeped the fuck out he talks like this penis is a separate, living entity? 
 music to my dick?! the fuck?! 
 lol k 
 see more from buzzfeed here. 
 edited to add again: just like midnight sun, the manuscript for this one was stolen a week before release and is feared to have been sold to the highest bidder in the black market. if it was really stolen, that was unfortunate. as much as i loathe the series, that's a douchebag move. however, i'll rip the book a new one if i find out this was only noise/marketing to hype the book even more. 
 edited to add: apparently, so many pre-ordered this it's already a bestseller, before it's even published. humanity, why? 
 a remake of fifty shades from christian grey's perspective?! 
 who the fuck needs that?! weren't the three books enough, for god's sake?! and seriously, doesn't the author have any other ideas to write than the same story?!?! 
 just imagine: 
 the same sex scenes. 
 just with more emphasis on his throbbing member. 
 i really could've gone on with my life peacefully without knowing we'll be ""graced"" by this same story again. at this point, i see it nothing more as a cash cow. edit 11/22/14 
 ""whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same."" 
 this appears as a quote from after. 
 this. appears. as. a. quote. from. after. 
 i can't even. i just can't even. my fuck-o-meter exploded with this. emily bronte would be choking herself to death if she were alive. 
 so, really, to those who believe this book is well written and todd has a way with words, better to know this lovely quote belongs to wuthering heights. 
 * * * * * * * 
 you know what? 
 fuck this. 
 fuck the industry, fuck the media, fuck everything that promotes abusive behaviour as something romantic and appealing. as something women have to put up with in the name of love. as something women deserve. as something women must strive for. 
 as a woman, as a person, this makes me sick in so many levels. especially due the fact that nowadays, most teens believe such behaviour is okay after reading so many books that romanticize manipulative, abusing bastards. this definitely needs to stop, for once. 
 and what about the mediocre writing? the fact that there's no plot whatsoever apart from an abusive relationship and make up sex? is this the literature we want? is this the literature that will survive, the legacy we'll leave to future generations? as a future editor, this disgusts me. it annoys me and it also saddens me, because i can't understand why things like this are being published. you can still make money by selling quality books, but apparently quality doesn't matter anymore. and some readers do not care about it either, as it seems by now, which saddens me even more. congratulations-winner of best romance 2017! 
 there is always a great deal of pressure when reviewing a highly anticipated novel before itaeur(tm)s release date. when this magical arc was delivered to my doorstep and i read the press release, i knew this would be a really special read. i cleared my entire tbr schedule to be able to read this book immediately and i regret nothing. if you are the type who likes to go into a book fully blind, iaeur(tm)m going to stop right here and encourage that you to wait until you get your hands on without merit before reading any further, or reading any reviews for that matter. do you see how short the blurb above is? itaeur(tm)s basically one line, and thereaeur(tm)s good reason for that. iaeur(tm)m also going to discuss minor spoilers of it ends with us, as well as talk about some vague themes included in this current book, just as a fair warning. 
 now that iaeur(tm)ve gone through the fine print, letaeur(tm)s start from the beginning. iaeur(tm)m hoping to refer more to my experience while reading this book and what i learned from it than the actual plot itself, as i feel this will better direct the right reader to this particular story. anyone who devoured it ends with us last year knows that hoover isnaeur(tm)t shy in dealing with tough subjects and trigger worthy issues (one of the many things i love about the woman), and i was blown away with the fictional tale shrouded in her personal family history to bring awareness to domestic violence and what can happen when the continuous cycle is broken. iaeur(tm)m not crying; youaeur(tm)re crying! when everyone went bananas over that book last year, it made me pause and ponder if perhaps coho is moving her stories slowly in a different direction. sure enough, i quickly discovered that without merit is unlike any book sheaeur(tm)s written thus far; if i had to compare it to another book of hers iaeur(tm)d say itaeur(tm)s most like iewu, except much less romantic. in fact, iaeur(tm)d go as far as saying that wm isnaeur(tm)t actually a romance. gasp! does it contain romance in the novel? sure, but itaeur(tm)s more of a side plot and it most definitely isnaeur(tm)t the focal point of the story. as you can guess, this was a risky move for the author in veering so far from her normal writing style, but iaeur(tm)m pleased to admit that it worked well, so well. this new direction is something i feel will keep hoover fresh, unique, and in demand for many years to come. 
 when i began reading, i noticed the differences almost immediately. i love how there are little twists and surprises in all of cohoaeur(tm)s books, but the ones found in wm are far deeper and more complex than those tied to her more traditional romance style. the first 50 pages or so in the book is a major info dump; i was wondering where the authoraeur(tm)s signature dry humor was and felt the build up of a more serious tone, which i think was necessary to prepare the reader for where she takes the rest of the story. once i hit that mark, the story really took off and i read the remainder in a single sitting. i found i couldnaeur(tm)t tear myself away from the quirky, sad bunch of characters who managed to still make me feel hopeful that things would turn around for them. hoover has brought together a cast that shows what it truly means to be human; the vulnerability of each and every one of us is felt through these realistic people and i think that is one of colleenaeur(tm)s major talents which results in bringing repeat readers to her new books. 
 while hoover chose to tackle domestic abuse and the horrific trauma involved surrounding the subject in her previous novel, here she has chosen to bring awareness to mental health, depression, and suicide among many other things. <aeur"" trigger warnings clearly listed. while you may think this sounds like a dreary, heavy read, and youaeur(tm)d be partially correct, the author never allows the light of hope to dim. you may feel like this story seems crazy, wild, and unrealistic within the first 50% of reading it, but if you reach the ending youaeur(tm)ll see it all makes sense and portrays a very timely, important message. i truly felt this was cohoaeur(tm)s most appropriate book for a younger audience, not only because the usual steamy, sexy romance is traded for a milder, coming of age and discovery, but because the message is just so dang important for our older teens and college aged students to hear. cue the feels! 
 i know iaeur(tm)m rambling, and iaeur(tm)m truly sorry for that, but this is a ramble worthy book. iaeur(tm)ve already heard some people speculating that they are worried theyaeur(tm)ll be disappointed in this dramatic change of style and genre for a beloved author; let me be the first to tell you, you have nothing to worry about. holy guacamole, this book is amazing! i canaeur(tm)t remember a single book since iewu that has caused me to take a step back and think about tough things for quite some time. i also think itaeur(tm)s truly appropriate that my 1,000th book logged as read on goodreads was such an important one as this! without merit is a book that is worthy of your time and money; donaeur(tm)t sit in a queue of 200 people waiting for it to come in at the library. buy it! pre-order it! add it to your tbr on goodreads! talk about it with your friends; i promise ladies and gentlemen, this one is worth the hype. as a mother of two young girls i took away so much from this book; it made me toss around scenarios and ideas of how i might react in a similar situation and what i need to do to be as involved, accepting, and loving toward my children as i can possibly be. clasp your pearls to your chest and grab a hanky; this one is a tear jerker, but per classic hoover, there is a ray of hope that turns into what a real happily ever after should look like. ps-that classic wit and humor does make many an appearance, i was just pulling your leg. gy~%0 
 *many thanks to the publisher for providing my copy; it was an absolute pleasure to provide my honest thoughts here. 
 you can pre-order without merit here: https://www.amazon.com/without-merit-... 
 ********************* 
 i don't even know what to say to do this book justice. what are words? how do i talk about this book sans spoilers? how can coho write books like this and not personally hold my hand while reading them? gy~ hands down my favorite jenny han book ever. this was the perfect conclusion and it filled me with joy and warmth and nostalgia. i'm so in love with this book. 
 ~05/2016~ 
 50% of me is excited bc more lara jean and peter 
 50% of me is dreading john. (yea i'm not a fan) warning: ragey rant against slut-shaming ahead. 
 ""what about frankie? i can't do this to her. i shouldn't have kissed you. i'm not that girl who--"" 
 bitch, please. you are. 
 this story is ya contemporary fluff about teenagers who make bad decisions. i'm not against this book because of the fact that the teens made bad decisions, i was a teenager once. i've made my share of idiotic choices about which i cringe upon reflection. i'm against this book because of: 
 1. incredibly bad decisions. yes, there is a difference between 19-year old me driving 80 miles to meet a (female) online friend (accompanied by my real life friend for safety) vs. 17 year old girls driving over 300 miles to las vegas to get drunk and then split to party with strange boys. i'm not trying to victim blame. i'm trying to beg the use of some common sense 
 2. the cheating 
 3. the slut-shaming 
 first, the good. diversity. it's awesome that the characters are diverse! hannah is korean. her best friend lo is mexican. awesome. but people, diversity doesn't make up for everything that's wrong with this book. 
 the plot: good-girl hannah decides to sneak away to vegas to meet her online best friend, nick. warning, spoilery stuff ahead if you should care to read this book. 
 *takes a deep breath* 
 turns out online-friend nick has a girlfriend. said girlfriend has big boobs and looks flashy, therefore she barely counts as a human being. therefore it's perfectly acceptable for nick to cheat on her. to make mooney eyes at hannah and for hannah to return the favor and fall in love with nick because his gf totally doesn't count, right? 
 wrong. bloody fucking wrong. 
 this is a story about hannah, therefore she is the good girl. she is not. if this story were told in frankie (nick's gf)'s perspective, it would be a whole different tale, one of how nick fucking cheated on her with a girl he knew online. yeah, how do you like them apples? it takes two to tango, and nick. is. taken. the fact that hannah wants him and feels and is portrayed as more worthy doesn't change the fact that. they. cheated. 
 cheating is not forgiveable, but can be more sympathetically portrayed, if there is remorse. if the person knows what they did was wrong. if they felt like the scum of the earth, etc, i might have some sympathy for them. there is none such in this book. 
 now the slut shaming. just because a girl has big boobs doesn't mean she's a bitch. doesn't mean she's a slut. my fucking god, are we in the victorian age here? desire is not a sin. having an enviable body is not a crime. just because a girl is beautiful and sexually attractive does not make her a slut. why do authors continue to perpetrate these harmful stereotypes? 
 hannah is so fucking resentful against frankie for her big boobs. she repeats this hateful tirade throughout the book and i was sick of it. listen to these examples. 
 and then a girl walks out from backstage. a tiny girl with red hair. not ginger red, but red like a crayon, dyed herself, probably, in some sink or bathtub like grace this morning. tight jeans, a loose t-shirt--but not so loose that you can't see her huge boobs--she looks the part of hipster or groupie or oh, i'm with the band girl. 
 ""that's his girlfriend. the chick with the red hair and the huge boobs."" 
 i don't need to have this girlfriend conversation with nick in person. and certainly not with her standing right next to us, big boobs all in my face. 
 i don't want to like her. i want to punch her in the face. i want to make her disappear so i never have to look at her funky style and big ol' boobs ever again. 
 i could never pull off those shoes and that dress in public. where did she get those boobs? 
 frankie, to me, was not a bitch. she is a perfectly nice girl, she is extroverted, she is eager, she is affectionate towards everyone - even hannah herself. but because she is inconveniently the object of nick's affection, she is portrayed as the bad girl. because she has large breasts, she is portrayed as the bad girl. that's not ok with me. i had attempted to read this book a couple of weeks ago, but i wasn't feeling it and gave up after 40 pages. man, am i happy that i gave it a second chance! this was so dang cute and surprisingly not cheesy despite the plot sounding like a total cheese-fest. i love how this wasn't just an adorable slow-building romance, but it also follows lincoln and his difficulties with growing up and moving on. definitely read this if you are a fan of rainbow rowell's other novels or romantic comedies! the most perfect ending to the most beautiful love story on planet earth. best epilogue ever, ever. 
 whenever i read a melanie harlow book i have an overwhelming desire to stalk handsome men on instagram. it happened with dima of course and the lovely brandyn and who can forget franggy? but theo macleod, i had to find my own inspiration for him. and i found a good one, yann wellhauser - you can thank me later for the eye candy. 
 aside from stalking handsome men, melanie forces me to buy bras and knickers to match covers. i was saved from that particular buying spree but damn i need the yummy goodness of cinnamony, sugary, marshmallow deliciousness that theo and claire cook. if yann can come and suck my fingers that would be just perfect. i'll even suck his. 
 now the book, claire hires theo to be her date at a wedding. does it end there? hell no. sexy times, red lipstick, banging in the kitchen, snowy cabins and fairytales. i floved it! madoc and fallon got their happily ever after. 
 so did jax and juliet. 
 this is jared and tate's.

 fuck you all! i'm out!! what if i fall? oh, but my darling, what if you fly? ~erin hansen 
 i fell in love with melanie harlow's latest sensation, after we fall, by just reading the synopsis. i had not even sunk myself into story and i knew it would be a heart-thrashing hit. cowboy...oh yes for this southern gal. ex-army soldier...double yes for this army wife. brooding, hot, muscular, rugged alpha...yes, yes, yes! sold! sold! sold! 
 after we fall held me in its clutches, quickly captivating and claiming me in one utterly unputdownable tale. i was at this story's mercy, needing to sink myself so deeply into after we fall that i never wanted to surface for air. this heartbreaking yet heartwarming story stole my breath where i was drowning to breathe. 
 my emotions were engulfed by this beautiful yet broken book, feels flowing all over the pages. chills ran through me. my breaths were bated. my pulse raced. my heart shattered. i felt every word i read. after we fall was my adrenaline...my anguish...my ache...my addiction. i was all in. 
 gorgeous and brooding cowboy, jack valentini, wants nothing to do with the beautiful blonde and blue-eyed margot 'barbie' lewiston who is bringing some much-needed pr expertise to his family's struggling farm. this rich gal is an annoyance and he doesn't want any more changes in his already devastating life. 
 ""i'd already met the love of my life...i'd married her, and i'd lost her...there was no second chance."" 
 i wanted to wrap up jack in a huge hug. my heart bled for this cowboy who suffered a great loss and is still stuck in the darkness. the closed-off alpha reveals a peek of his big heart and margot can't help but become enamored by this complex cowboy. 
 ""someone who loved like that had to have a big heart, even if it was buried beneath prickly layers of grief and bitterness. i'd give him another chance."" 
 margot is smart, funny, and beautiful inside and out...i loved her! the sweet and sassy woman wants to get to know the gorgeous, annoying, and tender-hearted man who gets under her skin. 
 jack wants to ignore the first woman since his late wife to invade his head and heat his body that's been in hibernation for three years but the magnetic force between margot and him is too powerful to ignore. 
 ""i knew what i was going to do before i did it. i knew it was a bad idea. i knew i'd regret it. and i still did it...i kissed her...our tongues met and i tasted her hungrily, like i'd never get enough...sweet and forbidden."" 
 the chemistry burns bright between margot and jack, a forbidden flame that fights to ignite, so hard to resist. oh did i love their angst that bled all over the pages! 
 ""he was kissing me like i'd never been kissed before. like he was going to war."" 
 margot awakened a sleeping bear in jack that had been hibernating too long, years since a mere kiss. 
 ""her lips on mine felt like rain after a drought."" 
 the beauty bathed in heat in these words that melted me to molten lava, my feels flowing all over the pages. swoon and sadness sent me over the edge. the passion poured off the pages, the pent-up tension a dam ready to burst. i was that dam too, my feelings bursting and bleeding too. 
 this country boy made me swoon! his sexy, seductive, sad, and soul-filled words made me sink under his spell. this tender and troubled, and soulful and swoony alpha held my heart in his hands. oh did i love cowboy jack! pure perfection. 
 ""i wanted to admit my guilt. open my wounds. bleed for her."" 
 margot is the beautiful angel who brings light to this broken and handsome cowboy. they are the perfect mix of dark and light, heat and cold, and city gal and country guy. opposites attract but the storm of the past may be a stronger force than love. 
 ""everything was bare to her now, all my secrets, all my suffering, all my scars. and she still wanted me. i felt myself falling...i had no right. no right."" 
 after we fall is not simply a broken and beautiful romance; it's a story about heartbreak, hope, and happiness. it's a story about life and living. it's about overcoming tragedy...taking that leap of faith...living for the moment...living life now. 
 the inner dialogue that is a consistent harlow fixture in all of this author's work is the icing on the cake in her creations, bringing realism and depth to already amazing stories. with every tale that melanie harlow writes, there is more heart and soul poured into each one...more emotion...more everything. every word meant everything that melanie harlow penned to life in after we fall, harlow's most heartfelt masterpiece and best book ever. 
 this magical mix of heart, heat, and humor in after we fall, this shattering and soul-searing story of love and loss, was my everything!!! oh did i fall hard for after we fall, this breathtakingly beautiful tale of hard-fought love that rendered me breathless. after we fall blew me away with more heart, more tears, more sorrow, and the most love i've had for any melanie harlow romance...ever. after we fall is one of those books that own my heart and soul for life. i want to bask in the glow of this harlow hangover a little longer. 
 'hard not to fall' stars 4.5/5 
 i really enjoyed this, especially the last 1/3 of the book! it had a unique premise, a great main character, a nice romance, and a great message. i recommend to all of you looking for a good quick read, whether you are usually a fan of ya romance or not! you just can't beat the person who never gives up. ~babe ruth 
 sitting in the stands watching your favorite baseball team play is a high that dives off the diamond straight to you as the energy engulfs the air. the fans are engaged and intently watching the players with baseball greats in tight pants an added bonus. adrenaline courses through your veins as you hope your team wins. you can't help but feel alive. the player by k. bromberg made me feel alive with its energy and emotion! pulse-pounding and passionate, the player penetrates the heart like a fastball, soaring straight to the soul! 
 when your heart is still racing and your pulse is pounding after you finish a book, it's the highest of highs...the best feeling ever!!! i rode the highest of highs with the player. this story sparked to life, and oh did i feel every flame...every tremor...every word...everything! easton and scout together were everything! the player was everything!!! 
 the player held my heart soon after i turned the first page, never letting go...i never let go. this baseball book instantly catapulted itself into my heart and mind with a force i was powerless to stop. the player assaulted me, its angst was my adrenaline and ache; its pendulum of fire and ice was my passion; and its power was my power too. this soul-searing story struck me like a fast ball, fast and furiously. the player was all fired up and ready to ignite all of the feels where i could not help but feel every one. 
 the player -- so powerful and passionate --possessed me. i could not devour this heart-stopping sexy and strong story fast enough. the baseball meets romance plot is powerful, easton and scout are combustible together -- so raw and real -- and bromberg's writing is off-the-charts incredible, flowing with a heady mix of feels and fire. my feels were on fire, engulfed in emotions that were flames, blazing with a dual dose of heady heat and heart. 
 the dedication made me smile. 
 the dedication is as powerful and poignant as the book. 
 the dedication is personal, a glimpse into the real woman behind the author...not k. bromberg but kristy. 
 the dedication is everything. 
 not even ten percent in and this story was already 5 stars. instant love!!! k. bromberg quickly hit this baseball book out of the park, and the game had barely begun. i knew that, being a sports romance addict, the player would be a huge hit but i did not expect my heart to be hit the hardest. i did not expect to need the player so very much. this raw and riveting romance was my oxygen to breathe, as i needed the player, pure power and passion in words. 
 easton wylder is a baseball god. a legend on and off the field. smokin' hot. a player with a heart of gold. a super star who has to defy the odds of playing baseball again after a big injury. 
 scout dalton is beautiful, brave, and bold. a female in a man's world of baseball. a ball-buster in a ball game-focused world. a healer as a physical therapist who has to live up to a legend. 
 scout is partnered with easton, her new patient. fire and ice. open and closed. hero and heroine. 
 ""if you're going to bust my chops, wilder, you should know that i can give as good as i get."" 
 like the rest of k. bromberg's heroines, scout is strength in spades with quick wit. i loved this sassy spitfire of a heroine! scout batted virtual balls with the player, a battle of banter that was charged with electricity....so enticing and entertaining. words were fire, burning through the pages. 
 ""i'm a hard girl to please."" 
 patient blends with player. 
 ""a demanding woman indeed,"" he murmurs before giving me that tender type of kiss that reverberates to your toes and then all the way back up until it slams into your belly. 
 lines are blurred...maybe crossed. 
 oh the heat that smolders from this story! 
 ""good thing i've got a big bat and know how to use it."" 
 there may be no going back now... 
 ""i think i got to you. i think when you close your eyes, you think about me. i think you don't want to, but you do, because god knows i think about you, scout."" 
 the push and pull of the player was the sweetest ache. 
 i swooned, as easton's words melted me like molten lava. easton and scout have combustible chemistry paired with passion that's difficult to ignore...a fight neither will win. the push and pull. the fire and ice. one or both may crash and burn. this game may end in a shut-out where only one player comes out on top. 
 this baseball romance has heart...all of the heart. the player touched my heart so many times that i lost count.the passion bled through the pages, each word a drop that oozed to life. tears fell hard and fast like baseballs, as these characters' pain became mine. i felt every word penetrate through me, pounding every emotion: smiles, swoon, and tears...i felt it all! 
 the player hits hard like a fast ball, feels soaring all of the way across the bases! k. bromberg takes you on the diamond, in the locker room, so close to this baseball game that you're part of this baseball team too. you can't help but surrender to this sports story--baseball meets romance--as emotions entangle around every word like a mitt to a baseball. 
 there is one constant in k. bromberg's books: live life to the fullest. take a chance...a risk. make every moment matter. this book and all of k. bromberg's other masterpieces matter. 
 i went into the player expecting a sizzling sports romance with a few feels. what i received was all of the feels and so much more. the player is perseverance. the player is power. the player is passion. the player is a punch to the heart. the player is k. bromberg's poignant words wrapped around a baseball story woven in love. the player is pure perfection. the player has all of the spark...all of heart...all of the soul. all of my heart. all of my soul. 
 k. bromberg brought her a-game out to play in the player, a grand-slam of a baseball romance that hits the heart and slays the soul. i loved the player so much! a 2017 super star, the player is the best baseball romance i've ever met! a must-read romance!!! this baseball-meets-romance book--an ace--is in the big leagues! i'm not ready for this game to be over. 
 ""i've played on grass my whole life, scout. there's no need for me to see what's out there when it's green beneath my feet.""

 a calculating sinful and devious story that erotically blends lust, romance, desire, and revenge into one palpable addictive read. skye warren has masterfully crafted a story that begs readers to enter into a world where deception, knowledge, power, and control is a must. so are you ready to make your move and outsmart the pawn? 
 ""as gabriel miller pointed out, i have one thing left of value. my body. my virginity. maybe the man outside wants that."" 
 it's no secret that i am a fan of skye warren and when she decided to write a story that dealt with a heroine auctioning off her virginity, you gotta know that i will be all over this book. and let me just say skye had me hooked. i was a pawn in her masterfully orchestrated game of love, survival and revenge. 
 avery james is the princess who fell from the graces of the elite and privileged. she once lived an enchanted fairytale life where she was spoiled by her father and had it all but that all came crumbling down when everything of value was gone. penniless and no money to help pay for her father's medical expenses, avery is forced to auction off the only thing that has value. her virginity. 
 ""you don't taste sweet,"" he says, pausing. ""you taste like i'm fucking dying and you're the only water around. you taste like goddamn air."" 
 so when gabriel miller bought avery james, she became not only his possession for one month but he owned her in every sense of the word. his command. his touch. his wants. his needs. his game. and avery james was just the pawn in this calculated move of revenge and power. 
 gabriel miller knew that avery james is an innocent virgin. she was his for the taking. and once he set his eyes on something, he claims it. as much as he is drawn to her, she was a temptation that he must resist. 
 avery's virginity is for the taking. it is only a matter of when gabriel will claim it. but what avery never expected was to be attracted to him. she wants and needs him in such a primal manner. but what happens when gabriel finally claims her virginity, will avery find her lose her upper hand in this game of control? in this game of knowing what move to make first, will the pawn outwit the king? 
 ""maybe i wouldn't feel so dirty if he'd just taken my virginity the first night. regular sex, right away. even coming on me, as sharp and intimate as it is, i could have withstood. it's the orgasms he forces from my body that feel like a violation."" 
 the pawn is hands down one of my favorite books that skye warren has written so far. each action, characters, and prose were meticulously and flawlessly delivered to heighten the erotic chemistry between avery and gabriel. i love that skye warren didn't hold anything back when it came to this calculating game of power, control, and lust. she had readers on the edge as she drops a few twist and turns along the way. and let me just say that ending, has me wanting the next book stat. so if you are looking for a book that was masterfully and erotically orchestrated then this dark romance is the book for you. 
 skye warren well that was a jaw dropper!!!!! 
 a fucking jaw dropper!!! i'm still reeling! ahhhhh! okay... i think i've found a new addiction and it's 
 royally 
 intoxicating!!!! you guys! i started paper princess around 11pm on a sunday night. my plan was to read until 12:30. yeah, rightttttt!!! 
 biggest mistake ever. 
 i had to forced myself to set it down. i had read and read and read and before i knew it i had to be up in 2hrs. two hours. the next morning i couldn't think. not about anything but this book. i was obsessed. intoxicated. completely taken by what i was reading. as i was making my kids breakfast, my mind ran a marathon, covering every little detail and scene my mind had soaked in. i couldn't get my kids to school fast enough. i came home. i finished immediately. and oh my word! seriously!!!! this, friends, is your next addiction. these royal's are delightfully wicked in every single way. 
 when you first meet callum royal and his sons, you don't know what to think of them. callum swoops in and saves the day. literally. i, personally, thought the man was fantastic. even with his blatant flaws glaring at you, i saw a diamond in the rough. i have a major crush on him. he's hawt. but his boys... oh, baby! his five sons left something to be desired. to be honest, at first they're a bunch of assholes. gorgeous assholes, but fuckers i wanted to throat punch nonetheless. however, first appearances are often times deceiving. there's soooo many things going on in this story. so many skeletons and little hidden compartments lingering behind the scenes, just waiting to jump out. i'm still trying to figure each of them out. 
 one of best things about paper princess, my most favorite thing, is ella herself. our main character is down right fabulous. at 17, this girl has handled more than anyone should. and it hasn't broken her. no, if anything it's made her one hell of a fighter. i respected her. i admired her. she's lost her mother, her father, and she's had to do things, to get by, that made my heart ache. this feisty, yet sweet girl, has been taking care of herself for what seems forever. and because of that she's developed an incredibly fierce sense of independence. she rarely shows weakness. and if she feels weak, she gets over it in the very next breath. simply put, 
 i have a girl crush on her. 
 with ella's life's doing a 180--from pauper to princess--she's thrust into the royal mansion. that could easily change her as a person, yet it doesn't. ella harper is a good to her core. but while she's good, she's also strong. she takes no shit and gives zero fucks as well. 
 [.... ""i lift a finger and trail it slowly across his naked pecs, my nail scraping across his smooth skin. his breath hitches, almost imperceptibly, but itaeur(tm)s there. 
 my heart leaps to my throat and blood begins to pound in places that i absolutely do not want to be associated with reed royal. urg!!! i don't know what to feel! i'm happy and i liked it but at the same time i'm not happy. and damn you john ambrose mcclaren for getting under my skin! 
 i was so mad the way peter kept putting gene first. lara jean had every right to break up with him. staying friends with gene is one thing but hanging out with her like 24/7 is ridic. then darn john comes in all charming and wonderful and then i start to want her with him. then peter finally at the very end decides to fight for her and she forgives him and says it was her fault all along that she needed to get over her gene insecurities. i wanted her with peter but peter never really apologized and why did he let her break up with him and then finally when he was jealous of john he started fighting for her??!!??!?!?! it was all very maddening!!!!!!!! 
 omg! thank goodness there is a sequel because dear peter... was definitely not an ending! except the author said there will be more about that other model un guy, john, and we will see his letter so thus probably another love triangle! no! just peter! no john!!!! go away john! 
 please finally have lara jean and peter end up together. and josh can just be friends with everyone. i don't think he should get back with margot after kissing her sister. i absolutely loved when josh and peter were arguing about who would get their cookies and peter said that if lara jean made josh's white chocolate cranberry ones and not his fruitcake ones then it was over. lol post script on may 8, 2012 
 this book has exploded since i first read it and it seems to be one that is either loved or hated. i'm actually very thankful that i read it before any of my gr friends or anyone i knew, because i feel like if i read it now, after hearing all the hype, it would probably disappoint. 
 people have very strong reactions to fifty shades and just to put in my two cents: you read different books for different reasons. in my opinion!!! ...: was this book a great piece of literature? no. were these characters ones whom you could write grad school theses about? no. but you know what? i loved the romance, i loved the chemistry, and i enjoyed myself tremendously while reading it - it had me grinning ridiculously for hours. that's what i wanted from this book, and that's what i got, so for me, that was enough. 
 post post script on october 9, 2012 
 i greatly appreciate all those who have defended my review in the comments section - especially those who completely disagreed with my opinion of the book. for those making hateful comments: you don't like the book, people who did are apparently driving you crazy, so my advice: stop reading all the positive reviews!! age-old rule: if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all. 
 post post post script on january 13, 2017 
 almost 500 comments on this review, but none for awhile, so not sure why i'm coming back to it now. i started reading the most recent comments though and my own review, and frankly i wanted to delete some of it, but figured that was ridiculous at this point. i wouldn't write this same review were i to read it now, but that was what i thought that morning at the time right after i read it, so it is what it is. finally watched the movie recently, which is probably what brought me round to this, and for the record: yes, christian does f*cked up shit (they don't even get to all of it in the movie) and were this real-life, i would have advised her to get a restraining order, because wtf. but it's not. anyway. i wrote what i wrote; i was in my early 20s; i liked it. peace xo 
 sincerely, juliana 
 * actual review begins here * 
 5+ stars. 
 wow. wow, wow, wow. i still feel somewhat under the spell of this book. i'm so ... beguiled by it ;-) (book allusion). it was honestly an amazing read - and one which i meant to just skim a few sample pages of, but ended up buying and then staying up the entire night to finish. i wasn't even sure i wanted to write a review, because it seemed too difficult to put into words everything that moved me about this story and to try to do it justice. 
 this ended up feeling like one of the best and most authentic romances i have read. in some ways, i feel conflicted like anastasia when i say that: my instinct is to say that can't be, because of what their relationship revolves around / how it's constructed ... but somehow it can be and it's true. anastasia, christian, and their relationship are all so honestly and openly written and shown to us that there is no other way for me to feel. even though its counterintuitive, i can't help but feel that their relationship is one of the most beautiful, complex, and emotional ones i've read in the romance genre. 
 it's one of those books that makes me want to go back to the last few 4-5 star books i read and knock down their ratings half a star, because when put on the same scale they don't compare. i had a ridiculously foolish grin on my face throughout the entire thing, both because i was on one of those this-romance-is-unbelievably-fantastic highs and the book had some surprisingly good humor. i had a pleasant feeling of anticipation as i read, but i was also extremely nervous, because real bdsm sub/dom books are not my thing, and so while i was falling increasingly in love with ana and christian with every new page i read, i was also terrified that i was going to be jarringly yanked out of it all and the whole experience ruined for me by some kinky and needlessly over-the-top bdsm scene. thankfully, that never happened, and it remained an amazing read right up until the very end. 
 { not what i expected } 
 i'm not normally a bdsm book reader, but this was so, so, so much more than just that. i don't think that i have read one that is so beautifully and (seemingly) authentic. i write seemingly because i have no personal experience, so no idea, but to me it read that way. it was not done as a space apart in the book where the writer could insert random hot sex scenes. instead, it's woven throughout, showing us how it impacts and affects both characters. ana and christian remain ana and christian in those scenes, in the sense that it doesn't feel like out-of-character gratuitous sex scenes are at every random turn just to satisfy some quota. i'm not even sure i want to categorize this book as erotica, because that seems so limiting. (there was hot - intense - chemistry, don't get me wrong, and i definitely had some turn-the-ac-up moments). 
 { loved our heroine: anastasia / ana (21) } 
 anastasia was one of the best heroines, because she felt so real and her reactions each and every time were so normal! not over-the-top for effect, but not understated because the author wants to be able to put lots of sex scenes. she's a virgin, has no experience with men, and didn't know anything about bdsm, so of course she's going to be questioning this and unsure of whether it's ""right"" or it's ""wrong"" or if she even feels comfortable doing it. she also is very attracted - and eventually in love - with christian and wants to be in a relationship with him. ana feels a connection to him that she has never felt with any other person and she wants him in her life; he makes her happy. her attempts to balance these two forces is wonderfully depicted and i could easily imagine myself reacting in those exact same ways, thinking those exact same things, and feeling those exact same conflicts. 
 ana is strong - she's somewhat shy and quiet, but like all real people, you cannot fit her into only one category: she may seem reserved and quiet, but she can also stand up for herself and really knows her own mind - she is not the ideal sub christian first thinks she might be. ana examines her motivations and feelings when she's confused or unsure - not only about what she should do, but about what she wants to do and what christian wants from her. the story is told in first-person, which is sometimes iffy for me, but it worked well here; ana's tone as narrator is smart, self-aware, and immensely likable. 
 { adored our hero: christian (27) } 
 christian is one of the best heroes. he's intense and dark and i know some people still see him as mysterious and the dark force in all this, but i actually found him to be so accessible. there are still things we need to know about his history, obviously - i have some guesses, but don't know anything for sure. nonetheless, he also felt like the most authentic bdsm dom i could ever read because he's not just that - he's a man who has that part of himself incorporated into his life, personality, and mannerisms, so that it's integral to his character, even when we see him around other characters who don't know about this part of his life. 
 christian is possessive, a little stalkerish, domineering (no duh), authoritarian, elusive, mercurial - all of those things and more. he is also one of the most tender, tortured, and sensitive heroes i've ever read. his despair and his need for ana is his life are like living, breathing things and they jump off the page. he also has a deep understanding about himself and his desires, though he discovers and faces new things through ana's questions and confrontations. he needs to dominate and control his partner, but he also needs ana, so he is willing to compromise and not only tries to give her that ""more,"" but ends up wanting it himself as well. 
 { an unbelievable connection and relationship } 
 from the first page of their encounter, the chemistry between anastasia and christian was off the charts. it was one of the things that convinced me to buy the book after reading the sample - it was so intense. their connection throughout feels so strong and despite the fact that they're coming from such different places, you can see the constant back and forth of them trying to fit together, trying to understand what the other wants, what they themselves want, etc. the dialogue, the emails, the everything between them is 
 a m a z i n g 
 !!! i had such a ridiculous grin on my face for most the entire book. this goes back to my first point, but i was just so amazed by how realistic their relationship seemed, despite the bdsm sub/dom factor, which to me seems so foreign. it was complex, difficult, lovely, distressing, uplifting, intense, hopeful. 
 { this book felt so honest } 
 and i mean this in multiple ways: the main characters, their relationship, and the subject matter. reading this book feels like an intimate act, because ana and christian are truly laid bare for us; yes, there are still things about his past we don't know, but who they are, their essentials, are revealed to us. their relationship is so honest, and i mean this in two ways: within the book and how the reader sees it. within the book, i so, so loved that they both try to be open with one another about their feelings and their doubts, that we see them trying to work through this relationship and feel each other out, figure out what this is between them. loved, loved, loved it! also, for the reader how their connection is shown, both in terms of man-woman and sub/dom felt very, very honest. it wasn't porn-like or gratuitous or kinky for kink's sake - it was built off of who these two people are and how they connect with and need one another. 
 { overall fantastic } 
 surprisingly funny and sweet! fantastic secondary characters. no evil guy or superfluous subplot - the obstacles are within themselves and their relationship and that is more than enough; anything else would have ruined the book and taken away from their story. subtle but sizzling chemistry and sexual tension. complex characters. etc, etc. 
 { ending of the book / series } (no spoilers) 
 *important to know that ana and christian's story does not end here.* 
 the ending is jarring, though i had ruined it for myself by having already read the next book's summary ( 
 fifty shades darker 
 , due out september 15). i think the buildup should definitely have been extended, because it did feel pretty out of the blue to me. 
 as little a thing as it is, the fact that the end says ""end of part one"" and this isn't viewed as book 1 and the next as book 2, really made a difference to me. gives more of a sense of continuity and makes this feel like an intermission. i love where the book / series titles come from, lol (christian's remark to ana that he's ""fifty shades of f*cked-up""). note: all together, there will be three books. 
 for those interested but unsure, google has a relatively long sample section you can read to get a sense of whether you'll like the book or not: http://books.google.com/ebooks?id=wr7...

 i liked this book. 
 i wish my husband owned a suit. this book is so much better than tarryn fisher being naked in your hotel room, spread eagle on the couch eating ice cream out of the tub. 
 i don't like ice cream though, so i'm not sure what that says about this book. 
 i also don't like tarryn fisher. 
 or hotel rooms. 
 i like eagles, but they're going extinct. 
 but mud vein was good, though. right? can i get an amen? i was only three chapters in when i had this strong feeling that i would never forget this story. 
 and now that i finished it, i can confirm that this is one of the twenty most memorable love stories i have read. 
 it took me close to twelve hours to finish this book, but i don't regret any minute i spent reading this emotional story. maybe i could have read two novels in that amount of time, but the problem with forever touched my heart so deeply i'm sure i'll be rereading it again in a couple of years. 
 it's magnificent. the love story, although wonderful and dream-worthy, is not even the best thing about this book. 
 mallory is the star. her characterization is outstanding and her character development admirable. the entire story is extremely well-written and convincing, but mallory - also known as ''mouse'' - will make any reader feel for her. 
 i couldn't stop thinking about her. it's not even some type of girl crush. she's the type of character so beautiful we're afraid to expose them to the world, because we don't want them to be tainted. we want to conserve them as pure as they initially are. 
 i didn't want to stop reading this book, because i didn't want to leave mallory. she has so much to deal with i felt like by keeping on reading, i was somehow there for her. she actually unconsciously makes the readers feel like their presence alone can help her. 
 it's incredible. i rarely feel this way about characters. 
 when we first start reading this book, we may think that there will be insta-love or insta-lust, but the author steers clear of those. mallory and rider have a connection because they grew up together and have been there for one another for a long period of time. but now, as they're facing each other four years after being separated, they want to reconnect, to relearn everything about one another. 
 it's so sweet. since it deals with long-term effects of child neglect and abuse, interested readers have to imagine there will be drama. and tears. and harrowing scenes. 
 but in the end, when i turned the last page and i looked back at my reading time, i couldn't help but realize how fascinated by the story i was. 
 it's not perfect, but it's perfectly imperfect.

 smashwords it's pride and prejudice for socialists. will i ever give a jane austen book less than 5 stars? doesn't look like it. 
 this is the second time i've read this book and i enjoyed it even more than i did the first time! mr. tilney is still the most hilarious flirt and i love how catherine has a crush on him from the beginning, as i found that far more relatable than the accidentally-falling-in-love trope that is in many of austen's other works. i'm not exactly sure what made this reading experience so fantastic? probably the fact that the faux-gothic style fit with halloween so much and that i was able to read it with the rest of the austentatious book club! also, as i am now more versed in her other works, i was able to see how this (her first novel) showcased her early talents and inner reflections on whether novel writing was a worthy profession. this book may not be for everyone, but if you're looking for a lighthearted and relatively easy classic to read, pick this up! 
 [original review from june 2015] 
 i really enjoyed this! i am, obviously, a huge fan of jane austen, but i had heard so little about this novel that i was unsure of it going in. it definitely isn't as perfect as pride and prejudice (nothing can be, let's be honest), but i loved the parody of 18th century gothic novels and found myself laughing at loud several times. mr. tilney, catherine, and eleanor were the only characters i really enjoyed in this novel as everyone else seemed to be vain, materialistic, and/or annoying. this both made me happy, as i had people to root against and laugh at, and unhappy, as the annoying conversations with isabella and john got repetitive after a while. still, i had a surprisingly fun time reading this and i can't wait to watch the adaptation with jj feild as mr. tilney (that beautiful, grammar-loving flirt) and swoon <3 arc provided by author in exchange for an honest review 
 there is no faking or pretending about it, ilsa madden-mills has the magical touch when it comes to writing love stories with heat, passion and most importantly heart. with her vivid and sexy prose, ilsa allows her readers to easily fall for her charismatic and lovable characters. and in the fake fiancee, this statement couldn't be more true as readers like myself are sucked into a vortex where we are consumed with an addictive, sweet, and palpable love story as two worlds collide on and off the field. 
 ""it wasn't about the pretending. i could be a fake girlfriend. it was my body that was the problem. i wanted max kent."" 
 max kent is the star and face of leland university. as one of the top contenders to win the heisman trophy, max's presence is known on and off the field. there are no shortage of football groupies who are willing to be a notch on his goal post. so when a feisty neighbor moves in next door, max is automatically intrigued with sunny and her sassy and vibrant personality. 
 as it turns out sunny and max shares a class together so naturally max offers her a ride to class. when they appeared in class walking together, automatically everyone begins to stare and wonder who max kent is walking with. when max suggest that sunny be his pretend girlfriend to keep his ex and groupies at bay, sunny doesn't think too much of it since max and her have this natural friendship and connection. 
 ""time and time again, i was taken aback by his off-the-charts hotness. but it wasn't his looks that tugged at my heart. not really. it was him--his innate charm that made me want to strangle him one second and then hug him the next."" 
 well as it turns out, it doesn't take long for sunny and max to realize that their friendship begins to get blurred. fake kisses and touches begins to feel real. innocent and playful text messages are no longer in the friends category. so when sunny and max finally acts on their attraction, what happens when fake becomes real? 
 ""our kiss was pure , unadulterated magic, making me powerless in his arms. he was gut-twistingly perfect, and i wanted to drown in him . i didn't need air. all i needed was max kent and his lips and tongue."" 
 i absolutely adore this gem of a book. ilsa madden-mills will definitely have readers swooning for max kent in the fake fiancee. mills did an amazing job showcasing that max kent may be the star on the football field but he also is the golden boy with a heart of gold. behind his rugged and sexy physique, there is no faking about it that ilsa has definitely written book boyfriend and book husband material. so if you are looking for a book that beautifully weaves humor, sass, raw emotions, and hot chemistry then you better one-click this book now. all i can say, this book was a major touchdown in terms of the new adult genre. 
 ilsa madden-mills laurelin paige, my heart has been split open, absolutely torn apart, and the only thing that is holding it together is the promise of book #2. i've read some damn good duets in the past, but my god, this one takes the cake! erotic to the core, you've created something special and unique with these characters. i've never wanted to throw my kindle against the wall more, and yet, i couldn't spare a single second turning my eyes away from the pages. you've given us a special kind of asshole with dk. he defines the term alpha male in every possible way. ladies, get ready for the men. there will be one particular man who you are just going to love to hate! and when i say hate, i mean h a t e! 
 ""how much do you want me to hurt you?"" 
 he asked. 
 god, i almost came. he knew. knew that this was edgy, that this brought up difficult memories, but he knew i still wanted to play. 
 ""do you want me to tell you to stop?"" 
 i'd never tell him to stop. i was sure i'd take whatever he wanted to give me. 
 he lowered himself over me so that i could feel his erection, hot and hard against my pelvis. 
 ""i want you to beg me to stop."" 
 and ladies, this isn't even the tip of the iceberg! there is so much hotness in this book! so much so, that you will be reading certain scenes over and over again. when laurelin paige gives us a series...she gives us a series! scorching hot, nsfw at all, sex scenes. emotion that runs deep through every single turn of the page. page after page of swoon-worthy, assholery...yep, that's a thing. look it up. there wasn't a page i didn't absolutely devour. there wasn't a chapter i didn't scream at. this duet...these characters...this storyline is everything. i'm obsessed. i'm addicted. i'm over the top in love with everything about these dirty filthy rich men. embrace your filthy fantasies and pick up this enticing and seductive romance now! i feel like there is a deeper meaning behind fifty shades of grey then just bdsm and sex but the huge downfall of this book was the writing. i can see both sides of the fifty shades argument. there are points in the book where i can see abuse but there are also points where there is none. 
 i just hate the fact that if people enjoy this book they are labeled as ""pro-rape advocates"" or ""pro-abuse"". stop it. stop trying to belittle others, everyone is entitled to their own opinion. you may not agree but don't hate, we are all readers here! l 'kthr 'nq@ mn wrd@ l tthrthr kthyr 
 nhn l nhdy wrwd lttklm `n ,, 
 bl lthmy ltbs m nwdwu qwlh !! 
 lswr 'wdh mqttft b`dsty 4.5!! waaaay better than that fifty shades of grey. i do get the comparison, but truly this is a much better read. simply put, this book had the polish that fsog grossly lacked. (i read fsog just before i read this one. sadly, i found it disturbing and only gave it a 1-star review.) 
 the major similarities: 
 --hero is a young (late 20's), gorgeous, brilliant zillionaire business mogul who sports non-stop erections and has sex on the brain 24/7 
 --hero has a controlling and obsessive desire for the heroine, including a jealous streak that is off-the-charts 
 --hero a has a dark and tortured soul that shapes his very world, brought on by years of abuse as a child 
 --hero maintains a platonic relationship with his past sexual partners, which drives a major wedge with the heroine 
 --hot, hot, hot sex scenes 
 the major differences: 
 -- gideon isn't a predator. unlike grey, gideon never tries to coerce and manipulate eva into doing anything that is for his sole pleasure alone. he doesn't try to coerce and manipulate her into believing his desires should be the only desires that matter. 
 --eva has about 100+ iq points on ana, and can actually converse in an intelligent conversation without all of the ""whoa!"", ""oh, my!"" and ""gasp!"" (to say i like eva better than ana is an understatement!) 
 --gideon isn't into 'period sex'. yuck. 
 --no bdsm, at least not yet. this series will continue, so hard to say where it will go. hmmmm. there was some light talk of subs & doms, pain-as-pleasure...etc. 
 --no arnica cream to sooth 'bruising, sprains and injuries'. (christian's remedy for a bruising sore ass, oh lovely) 
 --the writing is great. tight, edited and well plotted. it is also quite refreshing when compared to the comic book tone of fsog. 
 --not just one, but two main characters with damaged souls. (yep, eva has a dark soul too and it controls her.) 
 there are some other small similarities to fsog, but for the most part i found this book stood well on its own. gideon was a damaged soul, and the relationship between him and eva often felt like a co-dependent mess and not a true romance. eva's past continues to haunt her, so the main question is can two damaged souls build a healthy relationship? beneath all the layers of their relationship i did believe they will find true love and heal as best they can from their past. i never believed that with grey and ana in fsog. this was a gripping story and i loved watching these two come together and try to get it right. 
 if you are holding off reading this because you didn't like fsog, you might miss out. if you like dark, edgy erotica romance with great writing, then forget the comparison to fsog. i can't wait to see how sylvia day closes their story.

 sept 21 - audiobook review and update 
 the audiobook version of this book is really good! loved the narrator. 
 i think i enjoyed this book even more the second time through. the connection between gideon and eva is so deep and emotionally raw, and i think i connected with them even more in my re-read. they are intensely interesting characters, both individually and together as a couple. i picked up on many of the subtle details this time that helps to further explain why they are damaged souls, and why their turbulent relationship might be the healthiest thing for them. you don't find love. it finds you. it's got a little bit to do with destiny, fate, and what's written in the stars. 
 love found me in helena hunting's newest hockey romance, pucked off. oh did i love this story!!! so deep and different...unlike any other story in the pucked series...just wow!!! 
 i started pucked off with a big smile on my face as the books in the pucked series have been a mix of a lot of humor, heat, and heart and a little heartbreak. after a few words on the first page, i wiped that smile off of my face, replacing it with a mix of a serious meets sad face. my eyes were already ready to bleed tears. i knew from just one page that this book would break me, and that it did. pucked off broke me in the best way!!! 
 after just a few pages, i was utterly enthralled. pucked off was addiction...my ache...my all!!! i did not want to...could not...stop devouring this soulful story. after just a few pages, i knew that this story was six stars, a top 2017 read. 
 you may think you know hockey player, lance 'romance' romero, from the glimpses of this hot scot who looks like a fiery viking with his red hair, tall and muscular body, and piercing green eyes...but you have no clue!!! there is way more to mr. romance than meets the eye. mr. mystery is finally solved and you will be besotted with his soul-searing story like i was. 
 i'm a legend. i'm the one people whisper about, even though half of the rumors aren't true. i'm the man women with no inhibitions want. and i f**king hate it. 
 lance collides with a beautiful ginger who is as sweet as pie. her life is pretty routine until it's uprooted by a certain hockey player. 
 the instant connection between this couple was palpable. it wasn't just chemistry; it was a feeling of fate. 
 i could kiss her forever. i could live in this memory - past fused with the present. this kiss would be my heaven. 
 this story sparked to life as magic poured from the pages. i swooned so much at these tender and touching words that kissed me as butterflies fluttered around my heart. 
 i want to be worthy, and i'm afraid i'll never be. 
 this broken man broke me!!! i was gutted...unglued by lance as my heart was crushed along with his. 
 i have a broken boy who's become a broken man, and as stupid and naive as it may be, i want to be part of what heals him. 
 lance is broken but light lingers through that dark exterior, ready to burst and break free, waiting for an angel to save him from the dark. 
 ""i think there are parts of me that can't be fixed."" 
 pucked off was nothing i expected at all: it was more! so much more! this story stole, scorched, and shattered my soul. this book broke my heart, hitting it hard like a puck to the gut, shattering it like pieces of ice. pucked off is all of the heart and all of the soul! heart-wrenching and heartwarming, this hockey romance will break your heart in the best way!!! 
 i felt every word i read in pucked off where i was left gasping for air, wading in an explosion of emotions. pucked off is sorrow...soul...swoon...sensations...so much of everything! pucked off owned every pucking piece of me!!! 
 this devastatingly beautiful book is helena hunting's most pucking perfect romance yet and a top 2017 read!!! pucked off blew me away!!! pucked off is the most heartfelt hockey romance i've ever read. helena hunting brought her a-game in pucked off. this game is still far from over for me, as my heart is still pounding for mr. romance. 
 ""you're all the good things i didn't know i was missing.""

 after which julia was all 
 and crank 
 yep that's his name, first more than up for it, all of a sudden said 
 at which point i was thinking 
 than they both went back to their lives and crank not being able to stop thinking about her writes a song 
 i'm thinking 
 but when julia hears it she's all 
 and i'm like 
 than there is loads of different drama after which crank is all 
 and than julia does something stupid like this 
 and i'm like 
 than she's all why did i do that? 
 finally julia decides to sort her shit out, and i'm all 
 after which they both end up 
 and all i can do is 
 and at the same time i read this hilarious book in 2015. that was the same year steve harvey announced the wrong winner at the miss universe pageant. that doesn't have anything to do with this book, but i watched that moment on repeat like eighteen times. once upon a time there was a young woman with a dream. a dream that women the world over could live in freedom as equals. that they would have the right that many women have been denied for hundreds of years, possibly more - to live healthy, happy lives with partners who love and respect them and provide for their needs. 
 then that young woman read dark prince - and her dreams were shattered. 
 actually, this is all a lie because that young woman, the woman writing this review (yes! it is i!) didn't actually finish this twisted garble of a mess. 
 now i know, i know that i'm not always easy going on books. i have a standard (though considering the fact that i have read all ten of the bdb books may convince people otherwise but that aside...) i know i like the writing to be of a certain standard and for there to be characters of a certain quality and a plotline and world that has a certain depth and or immersive quality. 
 from what i read, this is less a novel and a how to guide. how to travel to a distant country and ensure your body is never found after you get abducted, abused and killed. 
 first and simple step: 
 1. do everything raven whitney does in the first chapter of her book. no, i'm not kidding. that really is her name. aptly so as she has long, silky raven hair (yes it's referred to as such in this book) which begs the question of what her parents were going to do if she'd been born with red hair. or if, she had been born with black hair, it had all fallen out three weeks later (as it did with me) and grown back blonde. 
 2. romanticize and imagine men like prince mikhail dubrinsky are sexy and possibly good life mates. 
 they're not. 
 ""but surely, kat,"" you say, ""you can't have too much to say about a book when you only read twenty-two pages into it."" 
 you'd better believe i do! 
 the book begins with mikhail, lonely and contemplating ending his own life. the following excerpt was actually published by the way. i'm not making this shit up for giggles. if i were it would probably be better: 
 ""grief overwhelmed him, consumed him. he lifted his head and roared out his pain like the wounded animal he was. he could no longer bear to be alone."" 
 [image error] 
 so our female protagonist, who has a psychic ability to connect with people mentally, contacts him to cheer him up. 
 he contacts back and love blooms. 
 okay, sounds alright, right? wrong! wrong, so freakin' wrong! 
 our two protagonists psychically meet on page two. he's sexually assaulting her with his mind by page 8. 
 but it's okay, because mikhail is a studly stud. he's an immortal, rich and extremely handsome. petty things like laws and personal boundaries and respect for women mean nothing to him, and they shouldn't mean anything to you either - this is the message of the book. 
 by page eleven, she has decided that he is mega creepy and decides to escape. he psychically contacts her to tell her that he knows that she wants to run away and it just isn't going to fly and that he can and will force his will on her. 
 now, at this point the correct response would be: 
 a) leave. 
 b) tell him to go get fucked and that if he so much as comes near you, you will scream bloody murder and have him arrested for assault. 
 c) give the psychopath your full name and casually head down to dinner. 
 i leave you to guess which option our fuckwit heroine chooses. 
 by page fifteen another man has casually placed his hand on our female protagonist's leg and invited her outside. correct, normal and balanced reaction from the male would be: 
 a) realize that this woman is a perfect stranger and therefor perfectly entitled to receive attention from other men. 
 b) decide to stake your claim next time you see her and offer to be her one and only - hoping earnestly that she will choose you. 
 c) use your psychic powers to attempt to kill him - stopping only when the female protagonist desperately entreats you to stop. 
 by page seventeen our chauvinistic-pig and emotionally abusive asshole male protagonist has the female protagonist in his arms and is running through the forest to his home with her. 
 raven, being the clever and clearly cautious little monkey that she is asks, ""did you kidnap me or rescue me?"" 
 oh wait, honey... i think i know the answer to this one! *kat thinks very, very hard* 
 she tells him quite clearly on page nineteen that she wants to go home... several times. 
 his response? ""you can not fight me, little one."" 
 this is what he calls her, by the way. i don't know about you but if a man starts to call me 'little one' as opposed to, oh i don't know... my name - then he is going to get one serious round-house kick to the face. 
 on page twenty, when any normal and sane person would have taken the first opportunity to give him a swift kick to the cajones and run like hell, the dumbest character i have ever come across...no, wait...the dumbest character i have ever come across enters his house of her own free will. 
 she ignores all of his past behaviour because he somehow understands her. he somehow connects to her. he reaches deep inside her to a place that has never been touched by anyone else before... i'd like to reach deep in and touch her brain because that obviously hasn't been touched before either! 
 why is this crap romantic? why? why does this spawn a series that sells lots of copies and makes the author lots of money? 
 the writing is not purple prose. it is beyond purple prose. purple prose would be embarrassed to be seen with this writing. everything about it is bad. 
 if you've seen the iron giant (lord, if you haven't go watch now!) then you'll know that in that movie is a giant robot made of iron. yet this robot has a thousand times more personality and charisma than our much touted and manly prince mikhail. 
 he's a robot. some kind of space robot given a caveman's brain by an alien species intent to discover if stupidity in the human race is indeed limitless and thus perhaps mined as a kind of fuel for their spaceships. this book was written by these aliens to test us and see how ridiculous we'll go. 
 however, if they have any success with this method - then i won't entirely argue with their plan because after all, by the laws of supply and demand - it'd be cheaper to fill up my car with stupidity then it would with gas. i loooooved this! i found it to be so relatable and just amazing. stayed tuned for a review/discussion to hear more thoughts! le sighhhh theo...i love a broken man more then i love pizza...and i love pizza!!!!! 
 theo is the prefect broken man...he plays the part very well...never stays in once place to long, never lets anyone to close, never connects with people. 
 clair on the other had is the opposite of broken...she is put together, she has a home, people who love her (not a special someone...yet) a great job she loves, and she has her art. 
 when you read a story like this you think that fate must have been playing a really big part in these two coming together. 
 they compliment each other well...where theo is lacking trust, and love, clair has it in boat loads. where clair lacks adventure and faith in the unknown and jumping with out looking theo has that all down pat. they fit together like a puzzle piece...she is straight lines, while he is the jagged edges. 
 this is a great story about not letting the past define you and breaking down your walls in order to let others in. it's also a great second chances stories with many a lesson involved. 
 if everything was easy all the time life would not be worth living...it's the challenges we face on this journey that make us the people we are...the people we are meant to be. follow me on: facebook | instagram | twitter | blog 
 laurelin paige is a 
 master of words. 
 when she writes she does it with such seamless precision, it hits you everywhere, in all the feels. her storytelling is exceptional, impeccable. it rivals some of the best for me. once again, i find myself in awe of her creative talent, consumed by the way she writes. i'm almost at a loss for words. 
 this duology is one of the best i have ever had the pleasure of reading. the execution... it all came together so flawlessly that words like brilliant, phenomenal, spectacular, just don't do it justice. there's nothing i could say that would live up to the magic that's buried deep inside these pages. i'm blown away by the intricate plot line, by the cataclysmic emotion that erupts inside the reader, by the depth of character development. it's a gritty ride like no other; utterly wild, infinitely frustrating, wholly intense. one that's more than memorable. one i'll be holding onto for a very long while. 
 first touch was one of my top reads of last year. i loved it so much that a part of me dreaded reading last kiss. sequels can be challenging and i've been let down in the past. however, with the cliffhanger ending that left me reeling, i was just as desperate to get my hands on this book. those two emotions---dread and desperation--warred with in me when i finally sat down to read and i found myself obsessing over everything. i was scared that this might not go the way i wanted it to. the way i needed it to. my attachment to these characters ran deep. i was invested. my heart was on the line. 
 that said, if there was ever a sequel that trumped a first in a series, it would be this. 
 i was left breathless. 
 from dread, to despair, to anger, to frustration, to feeling hot and bothered all over, laurelin delivered big time. she showed me--the reader--that once again she owns every line in her books, she's knows exactly what she's doing, and we can trust her to take us on a ride that's more than worth it. 
 last kiss picks up exactly where first touch leaves off. i'm not getting into plot details. i don't want someone who hasn't read the first book to stumble on this review and have it all ruined. just know you're in for a whirlwind that's simply unforgettable. 
 emily has codependency issues. she's complex and infuriating. it's not an easy ride. the emotional attachment she has to her ex best friend is weaved into the strands of who she is. those threads are thick and almost impossible to sever. and at the end of the day emily doesn't trust herself to make good decisions. she's desperate for approval. and many a time, i broke for her. i love this woman. f**ked up, crazy, impulsive, submissive, reckless, lost, damaged, it didn't matter, i loved her with a passion. i understood the dark in her. i craved the same things she did. i found myself sick with the very same emotions she was experiencing. she's a complicated character. her issues run deep. yet her heart is pure goodness. 
 reeve continues to be our brazen, dominant man in this series. he's everything an alpha male should be. i absolutely adore the way he's as harsh as he is tender. his cruelty is a turn on. he ruins you and puts you back together. i fell head of heels in love with that possessive, controlling man. he's everything i want and once again, my love for him was cemented in ways i couldn't have ever imagined. no one comes close to his intensity, his protectiveness, his heart... but his moments of vulnerability really destroy me. my god, i love him. his fierce loyalty is so sexy. he would do anything for the woman he loves. 
 this story is messy. it's multifaceted, dark, and gritty. there's nothing that the author shies away from. she writes with a ferocity that is visceral and palpable. last kiss is a tsunami of feels. the twists and turns will take you everywhere. i highly recommend this series. i'm completely blown away! and i can't say anything but amazing things. it's unforgettable. 
 *** arc provided in exchange for honest review from netgalley *** this was super cute and really interesting! 
 more thoughts and possibly a bibliobabble to come! i don't even know what this is about, but after the hating game: surprise, surprise, this is my first time giving a colleen hoover book one star as a rating. actually, i have never never (ha!) rated one of her works less than three stars. her novels are usually enjoyable, but i very much disliked this one...and am not going to feel sorry about it. there are some books on goodreads that you can feel uncomfortable writing a negative review for because of how many of your friends loved it or people in general, but i'm not going to let this one be one of them. never never, you sucked missed the mark. so badly. 
 first off, this is not new adult; it's young adult. the characters are in a freaking high school! and there is freaking high school boy drama! secondly, this is not a story; it's a big and frustrating teaser. if we had an entire novel, what i just read would have been the first two chapters of it. (because i'm taking out the useless ones only meaning to confuse us more.) in fact, it is as if the authors told themselves ''the more we confuse our readers and add unexplained information, the more they're going to freak and love it!'' nuh-uh. yes for the former: i am indeed freaking out at how much i disliked this but never in a million years would i come to love this short story (ugh, it even hurts to call it that.) 
 alright, so you're probably wondering about the characters now. are they nice? beautiful? well-developped? 
 ''i think my mother may be a bitch.'' 
 yeah, that was charlie, the main character, you just heard. she thinks her mom is a bitch because the latter wants to protect her against silas whom took her husband away from her - i assume - and hurt charlie. but are we given real detail on that? well of course not, that would have been giving the readers too soon what they want. why not let them linger a little while longer...until may 2015 perhaps? i hope this is at least a duology. let's not even start on silas. the author pictured him as a guy hopelessly in love with charlie (even before really knowing her) with so much intensity that i wasn't convinced anymore. it was too much. and too soon. 
 there is cheating. (it may not count for some, but that made me doubt charlie and silas' true feelings for each other.) 
 there are plenty of unanswered questions. (how did they lose their memories? and why? because they wanted to forget what they did to each other? why did they do that in the first place? what did charlie's dad do? - more detail please! what did the files contain?) 
 there is a cliffhanger. 
 there is an insta-love vibe and a high paranormal one too. it's a very unrealistic contemporary story with a hard to imagine and unbelievable romance and a deal of under-developed secondary characters. and the writing wasn't even that good! simplistic and sometimes in contradiction with the personality of the characters. often in the book, silas says how he doesn't like what charlie does with a voice that implies more ''i dislike this chick.'' than ''i'm deeply in love with this beautiful girl.'' 
 also, this: 
 i'm standing on the edge of the lawn, looking down his street when he walks up behind me. i don't hear him approach, but i smell him. i don't know how, since he smells like the outdoors. 
 this is ridiculous. are you sure you didn't sense him, instead? *shakes head* 
 i did not like this and would not even recommend it to my worst enemy. i know many of you liked it though and i respect that. i'm debating whether reading the sequel or not, because who would be okay with having so many unanswered questions on their minds? but i will not prioritize it even a tiny little bit. i have something to share!!! and it's not an std. 
 it's a deleted scene from 'dating-ish' and i think you're all going to enjoy it (at least, you'll enjoy it more than an std... i think).

 original review 
 team lucca all the motherfucking way how to write a paranormal romance 
 step one 
 : create a sue 
 this is a female lead that can either be a mary sue, a jerk sue or a sympathetic sue. just an fyi, most writers go with a mary, as the ideal of women remaining virgins until they find ""the one"" is allegedly still vastly appealing to the masses. i suggest creating a heroine that's never even been attracted to a man before. it makes it seem more like it's fate when she meets the male lead and less like you're trying to shove antiquated beliefs down your reader's throats. 
 step two 
 : create a ragebeast 
 your male lead should be over six feet tall, have dark hair, tattoos and so much testosterone-inflated muscle that he has to walk through doors sideways. the less he talks, the better. in every scene that you're tempted to give him dialogue, instead make him brood over something. you're going for caveman here, modern women don't want a partner that can communicate feelings or sympathize with emotions. we just want someone who can bench press twice our body weight. 
 if you really want to make us swoon, make him a prince too, or an uber-alpha, or a frigging king. that will fulfill the princess fantasy that half of us are infected with thanks to those assholes over at disney. 
 step three 
 : make these two the exception to each other's rules. 
 emotionally cripple the male. he shouldn't believe in love. not until he sees your mary sue. when he finally lays eyes on her however, you can take that caveman frown and turn it upside down. i suggest blaring foreigner's i wanna know what love is on repeat while writing this scene as it will really help you capture the emotion your readers should be feeling at this point. 
 and remember that lack of attraction to the opposite sex you've afflicted mary with? well, when she lays eyes on your beast of a male lead her va-jay-jay should turn into the river nile. 
 step four 
 : the shmushing together of squishy bits 
 sex. add it. lots of it. on a bed, in the bathroom of a club, a stairwell, an alleyway, you get the drift. just know that the more you mix it up, the better. repetition is the bane of the sex scene's existence. also, we'd really appreciate it if you could avoid using these phrases: 
 1. slippery juices 
 * this brings up safety concerns 
 2. clenching womb 
 * she's having sex, not a baby 
 3. pulsating sausage 
 * i like breakfast cooked, thanks 
 4. squelch 
 * i shouldn't have to explain this one 
 step five 
 : don't forget the mystery! 
 as tempting as it may seem, you can't just fill up three hundred pages with nothing but relationship angst because if you do 
 i will 
 people may hate you. you'll want to add in an actual plot line to avoid that. don't worry, it's not as hard as it sounds. make up a creepy crawly bad guy, have him kill some innocent people and maybe torture a kid or rape someone and your readers will immediately hate him and get behind your mcs and their fight for 'good'. you don't even have to get that heavy with it. in fact, you can probably squeeze it in between your gymnastic-inspired sex scenes. 
 step six 
 : climax, the literary kind 
 have the bad guy kidnap the heroine. feel free to let him slap her around a little and hint at the terrible things he's going to do to her but don't get too carried away here as you may offend those with delicate sensitivities. just before the villain can carry out these dastardly plans, have the hero save your mary sue. what? well yes that's a little damsel-in-distress-ish but trust me on this, everyone else is doing it too and no one's complaining about it yet. you want readers or not, lady? 
 step seven 
 : heas; they're not just for fairy tales and contemporary romances 
 end your book on a high note. your readers don't want cliffhangers or dead male leads. they want to see a white dress or a bad guy with coins on his eyes because your ragebeast eviscerated him before rescuing the heroine and taking her back to his 'lair' to bang the hell out of her regardless of her emotional, mental or physical bruises. 
 one plus of going light on the plotline (like i suggested) is that it makes it easy to wrap things up in a nice little bow. you're welcome. 
 okay so this all sounds rather critical, and it is. i'm sure you're wondering ""so why the four stars?"". well, in my opinion, this author takes all the themes i've mentioned and does them well which makes for one entertaining and sexy read. 
 this review can also be found at the alliterates. gunshy: is a full length standalone novel by lili st germain. spoken in 'dual perspectives' leo bentley & cassandra carlino aka cassie 
 this kicks starts us off in a dark gritty place, seventeen year old karen a troubled teenage girl who had gone missing in gun creek a week prior, her severed body is discovered in a well on a local property by leo nine years ago, 
 itaeur(tm)s not every morning you drink dead girl juice 
 after taking a long gulp of water out of a glass he knew straight away something wasnaeur(tm)t right, the taste alone made him gag, the colour of the water didnaeur(tm)t seem right either with it being a dirty rusty red colour climbing down the well thataeur(tm)s when all was revealed. 
 something forever changed in leo that day, gone was his easy go lucky happy nature and in itaeur(tm)s place was a different boy entirely. 
 one year later a car careens down an embankment during a snowstorm, nineteen year old leo at the wheel, sent to prison for nineteen years for driving under the influence, one female forever locked in a coma, this event forever changes the people in this small town, secrets, lies and deceit become an act of survival. leo's and cassie's lives will never be the same. 
 released from lovelock penitentiary for good behaviour nothing is the same, the town has changed, the people have changed. 
 i left behind a girl, and now that i'm back, that girl is gone. she's a woman now, with pain in her eyes that i put here. 
 another girl goes missing nine years after karen brainard which could send him back to prison again facing the death penalty if he reveals what he knows about her disappearance. 
 at this point in the story this is where the author opens up a can of worms, because boom boom boom events from this stage onwards because from this point onwards the events that unfold will definitely give you whiplash keeping up. 
 my thoughts: what a crazy assed dark psychological thriller this one was, i feel like iaeur(tm)ve been pulled through a hedge backwards, the twists and turns, the dark and grit just kept coming and coming and along the way you feel and connect with these characters. 
 in typical lili fashion as per usual i'm left reeling, gobsmacked, stunned, sitting down and writing up this review and wondering what the fuck did i just read, this was one fucked up crazy assed ride, this book threw many twists, many curve balls that had me reeling in their aftermath, like a tornado that has ripped through a town left floundering in its wake, this book exceeded all my expectations, ticked all my boxes and left me wanting more, i can not wait to see what lili brings us next. i highly recommend this, it's dark, twisted, raw, disturbing, gritty and highly addictive. i'm almost finished writing this baby! so can't wait to share. much swooning here... :) i received a copy in exchange for an honest review 
 i couldn't wait to get my hands on this book, not only because it is by the lovely and talented m. never but after i read an excerpt and experienced the smooth talking southern boy steaming up a supply closet and calling someone ""sugar"", i just knew i had to experience the southern night series! before long i was completely enraptured with kamdyn and laney's emotional and heated story, hoping that the push and pulls of life, jealousy, and celebrity status wouldn't stop them from being together. 
 kamdyn ellis had my heart pitter pattering right from the start. even when laney made him ""work hard"" to prove he wasn't just a player anymore looking for a good time, i fell hard for his southern charm early on! as the story progressed, i came to love everything about kam from his sweet nicknames for laney, his smokin' hot muscles, down to his caring heart. he really is completely laney's whether she believes it or not. 
 laney summers is a sassy city girl through and through and shows it with every bit of feistiness that she throws kam's way on every page. i love this heroine that has to learn the hard way that she can trust kam with her heart and has to keep apologizing for all of the misunderstandings between her and kam. she lives up to her nickname ""lemon"" and her snarky comebacks to kam's endless charm keeps readers entertained and hanging on to every word. 
 m. never delivers another scorching hot couple that has you laughing and tumbling head first in love with them from the very beginning of their love/hate antics. i highly recommend the southern night series for a love story that takes readers through great depth of emotions in their relationship that starts budding in high school and blooms past the college years. kam and laney are sure to have you doing the in zone dance and ending the last page with a smile on your face and two more characters weighing heavy on your heart! m. never knows how to score with the readers whether she is writing about a football hottie, or two smokin' hot twin brothers. she changes our hearts forever and keeps us coming back for more!"," possible spoilers and definitely nsfw (unless your workplace is made of awesome) 
 oh my god you guys this book oh my god 
 i went into this thinking it was going to be completely and totally lame another fifty shades of moronic writing another horrifying testament to the standards which modern writers are apparently held and do you know what it was buuuutfor the most part i had a good time how by laughing uncontrollably at nearly every sex scene (and believe me there are many) 
 there isn't much of a plot but then i guess there doesn't really need to be since it's just smut cleverly (*snort*) disguised as literature but fans generally defend the story and i've gotta say as far as stories go it's pretty lame i mean come on peeps they're damaged they're melodramatic they're whiny and self-absorbed they're like sooo hot and the entire ""story"" is them fucking and then whining about it and then fucking some more when i first got started i was terrified because i hit pretentious wordage in the second sentence: 
 ""i wasn't surprised by my roommate's emphatic pronouncement"" 
 the entire book goes on in a similar vein plus there's the added bonus of being told very inconsequential details like what color shoes eva's wearing how many steps she had to climb how often she eats yogurt to keep regular (i'm making up my own but you get the gist) having your eyes raped by adjectives and other useless textual diarrhea does not usually make for a highly compelling read there is seriously a point where eva tells the reader how in love she is with new york because it's so different from her hometown of san diego with all the people and activity and sights and sounds (i'm really not kidding) the first quarter of the book was basically just useless info dump nonsense 
 things picked up a little bit when eva first met gideon only because the writing in that scene was so ludicrous phrases like ""exquisite masculinity"" ""magnificent maleness"" ""scorching force of will""and let's not forget such treasures as 
 ""i thought for a moment that he might be able to make me orgasm just by talking long enough"" 
 and 
 ""i looked at him in his civilized urbane outrageously expensive suit and thought of raw primal sheet-clawing fucking"" 
 <--- try saying that three times fast 
 this was also when i was introduced to gideon's apparent mind control powers eva just goes on and on about how he's put some kind of spell on her she's inexplicably drawn to him caught up in his magnetic force blabbidy blah blah i suppose it doesn't hurt that gideon is ""savagely gorgeous"" and that eva's eyes ""burned just from looking at him"" 
 but then oh then i got to the good stuff i'm not saying that as a pervert but as a lover of all things inappropriately hilarious if i didn't know any better i would swear to everything holy that this book is satire because while some of the sex scenes were hot they were almost always laced with one or two lines that had me laughing so hard i was in tears 
 without further ado i'm going to treat you to a small sampling seriously prepare yourselves for this take a deep breath make sure your bladder is empty and that you've got water and aid nearby in case you fall over and for the love of eye bleach don't let your kids read it: 
 ""his powerful body straining with the primal need to mate"" 
 ""the rhythmic slap of his heavy balls against the curve of my buttocks"" 
 ""then he ripped open his button fly and pulled his big beautiful penis out"" 
 ""gideon battered my tender sex with that brutally thick column of rigid flesh"" 
 ""his breath leaving him in primitive grunts every time he hit the end of me"" 
 ""'i'm so deep in youi can feel it against my stomachfeel my dick pounding into you'"" 
 seriously is that shit supposed to be sexy because it's just not he can feel his dick through her abdomen no that's not how wombs work or dicks or anything she calls her ass her rear and that's silly when you're talking about a guy finger banging your fart box but when gideon jammed his finger into her ""puckered hole"" i nearly lost my dinner/sanity/sense of direction just take your pick because my mind shorted out for a few seconds i hate the word ""puckered"" and all its variations now i really wish she'd just called it her puckering poopshoot and at least given the reader the joy of alliteration did i mention he's apparently ramming his semen in there oh and this is after she stands up and drips his load all over the floor making gideon all hot and bothered because apparently lack of adequate hygiene is a major turn on for rich neurotic alpha males 
 [edit 12/21/15: i read mostly m/m romance now and i've read and enjoyed some pretty raunchy anal sex scenes complete with semen insertion and you know what i still don't find this book hot] 
 at one point gideon says he feels a desire to ""mark"" eva like she's his property 
 i always get sidetracked when writing reviews like this because all i ever want to focus on is how funny it all is but maybe you want to hear how the story stacks up how the characterization is how the plot progresses or what the obstacles are i can probably sum each area up in five words or less 
 story: two people fucking 
 characterization: cliched and irritating 
 plot progression: it's two people fucking 
 obstacles: sexual abuse and shallowness 
 yes they're both damaged and need each other and he's dark and brooding and she's blonde and angelic and the two of them end up in this mindfuck of a relationship this monumentally codependent clusterfuck of sex and jealousy and petty mind games and when i wasn't laughing i kinda wanted to shoot myself in the face 
 guess what else gideon gets all rapey when he's sleepy (no seriously he rapes in his sleep) 
 it's stupid 
 really really stupid 
 so why two stars i'll tell you why two stars 
 ""the room lit up in a sudden flare of illumination i turned toward himand found him masturbating with shocking viciousness"" 
 happy reading being a male reader on a booksite you kind of expect to be outnumbered when it comes to the sexes but that doesn't keep alarm bells from blaring like a convoy of reversing trucks when practically every reviewer of a book is of the female gender and when the author in addition is touted as the winner of multiple romance novel awards your primal male instinct is to run like your being chased by some primordial predator 
 so it was really against my instinct and better judgement that i began reading this book but this is not a romance novel in fact it is a brilliant comment on the issue of euthanasia which claims it's brilliance by reading like a romance novel and not a political comment having personally cared for a handful of terminal people over a period of years i feel i can safely say that many of the thoughts on serious aquired disabities and the quality of life is fairly realistic and though the romance part can't avoid a bit of hollywood-sheen it never really gets unbelievable and helps the reader engage him/herself in the characters and thus in their horrible dilemma 
 thoroughly engaging and thought provoking this is the best book i've read so far this year (and i so did not see it coming) lady midnight tore me apart then pieced me back togetherthen tore me apart again 
 loved this book 
 a very detailed review will be up on my channel later this week :) this first part was originally written in 2012 
 jesus the book isn't even out yet and you guys are trashing it already seriously wait at least until it comes out read it and then give your opinion right now it's just useless and pissing all of us fans off she's not milking this if she really just wanted more money she wouldn't work so hard on all of this beautiful material she's creating for us for us she doesn't have to do this she could be working as a doctor or a lawyer and making money and if you think those two jobs are harder and that writing is easier you're 100% wrong it's not easy it's hard as hell but she does it and she does it beautifully it's even harder to get published and get enough books sold do your research before you go around calling people cash cows we've all got to make a living some people do it by working at jobs that they absolutely hate and some like ms clare do it by sticking with what they're passionate about so what if she makes money her books are amazing and if you don't like them that's fine but it's rude to trash talk a series that isn't even written yet in fact it's rude to trash talk anything but the least you could do is hold off until you have something to trash talk 
 ---- 
 oh my god i knew this book would be amazing and it was so freaking amazing 
 cassandra clare you have done it yet again you've managed to make me care so much about characters i just met and made me feel their happiness pain sadness as if it were my own i was so sad when i saw the last page and then the last conversation really really gah 
 i really hope that the people who were trash talking have read it and been stunned she created yet another beautiful masterpiece and i was more than happy to spend money on it ""i cheated on her every day in my mind i thought of you in ways i shouldn't have again and again she was nothing compared to you i've never felt this way about anybody before--"" 
 what's the saying once a cheater always a cheater oh the fucking hypocrisy 
 there were many things i wanted to do to anna oliphant throughout this book some of them involve a bottle of choloroform a shovel and an unmarked grave mostly i just want to bring anna in front of the us congress as an example of how the us educational system has grievously failed our students to be frank anna oliphant is a motherfucking idiot 
 yeah i guess you could say this is a sweet romance but it's not the good sort of sweet it's the ""oh my god why did i eat that entire package of oreos i don't even like oreos"" sort of sweet it's sickening and best in small doses and i still feel like i need an internal cleanse after spreading the reading of this book over several days the good thing about it is that this book isn't the sugar-free type of sweet so there were no anal explosions it wasn't the worst contemporary i've ever read but this book was tremendously annoying and i simply do not understand the hype i know many of people enjoyed it and i can see why anna is the sort of character that grows on you much like mildew or herpes once you get used to having it it doesn't really bother you much anymore 
 i'm not opposed to romance i love romance but i read this book hoping to be swept away by a romance instead i was sucked into a whirlwind of idiocy 
 oh the stupidity: 
 the only french word i know is oui which means ""yes"" and only recently did i learn it's spelled o-u-i and not w-e-e 
 people like anna oliphant is the reason why everyone hates americans anna is 17 and she is a moron she is the epitome of the stupid ignorant egocentric american for fuck's sakes she thinks there are motherfucking mimes on every fucking corner in france she thinks that people go watch mimes as an everyday pastime 
 i'm going to be sick i'm going to vomit that weird eggplant tapenade i had for dinner and everyone wil hear and no one will invite me to watch the mimes escape from their invisible boxes or whatever it is people do here in their spare time 
 i'm sorry but i'm inclined to judge anyone who doesn't know that 
 oui 
 is spelled o-u-i and not w-e-e it's one of those foreign words that isn't even fucking foreign because it's so fucking common oui is yes in french si is yes in spanish it's one of those words that's so fucking commonly used that you have to be a complete birdbrain not to know 
 anna is terrified of anything foreign although to me france really isn't that foreign or exotic but i didn't grow up in atlanta is atlanta really that ass-fucking backward is atlanta really completely isolated from the rest of the world despite being one of the biggest cities in the us (anna's words) do they not have paninis in atlanta 
 ""where have you been all my life"" i ask the beautiful panini ""how is it possible i've never had a sandwich like this before"" 
 not only is she ignorant she has no survival skills anna is in paris attending a school for americans fucking everyone speaks english the french teachers speak english anna is terrified of getting food in the cafeteria and avoids the cafeteria for weeks because she doesn't know how to order food 
 let me tell you a brilliant way of ordering food in any language you smile you make eye contact at the desired food you point you nod it's motherfucking universal 
 i hate to say it but if you're a pretty girl you can get anyone's help (most likely a guy but often another girl too) just by looking cute and helpless and tilting your head at an angle (guilty as charged) it ain't feminist but it works when one is desperate and the fact that anna doesn't have the fucking common sense to do this instead of hiding in her room for weeks like a motherfucking pussy doesn't bring her up in my estimation i'm not judging anna for being shy anna is not shy i was a shy shy teenager anna is incompetent there is a difference between incompetency and shyness 
 after weeks and weeks of going to classes of learning frenchanna doesn't know how to fucking spell ""please"" in french 
 mer is next in line and i transcribe her speech phonetically 
 oon ploss see voo play 
 that's suppsed to be une place s'il vous plait 
 her impression of paris is one with like blah blah marie antoinette and that really short dude like i think his name is napoleon you know like the one on the horse in that painting by that dude and oh my god the moulin rouge and that cute little movie with the little girl in the yellow thingy madeline 
 and this is a chick who wants to be a film critic when she grows up 
 my dream is to study film theory in california i want to be our nation's greatest female film critic 
 although judging from the way she thinks i think she's more suited to a career writing for the tabloids the type with the sort of ""president obama caught in interplanetary orgy along with putin and merkel"" headline rather than as a film critic 
 i wonder if matt is a better kisser now that he has someone more experienced to practice on he was probably a bad kisser because of me 
 oh no 
 i'm a bad kisser i am i must be 
 someday i'll be awarded a statue shaped like a pair of lips and it'll be engraved with the words world's worst kisserand matt will give a speech about how he only dated me because he was desperate but i didn't put out so i was a waste of time because cherrie milliken liked him all along and she totally puts out 
 oh god does toph think i'm a bad kisser 
 anna anna anna: so beautiful without knowing it so perfect so adorably fucking clumsy she even looks gorgeous when she falls flat on her fucking face 
 ""you're beautiful"" 
 i trip and fall down on the sidewalk 
 i look away as he takes my hand and helps me up ""i'm fine fine"" i say brushing the grit from my palms oh my god i am a freak 
 ""you've seen the way men look at you right"" he continues 
 ""if they're looking it's because i keep making a fool of myself"" 
 i've seen this before and it ain't cute spare me the whole adorkable thing i don't like zooey deschanel and i don't like anna it just looks like she's trying too fucking hard and the cute but oh-so-clumsy trope is just so fucking overplayed right now i wash my hands of it 
 it's not blatant but the relationships between the girls in this book are meant to portray anna as the good one the best one the most adorakablest girly girl in the whole wide fucking world rashmi is ""rash"" cute i don't think so mer is just a little chubby volleyball player chubby but it's ok ^_^; amanda the slut amanda the bitch and anna anna is just so good because you know she feels really bad that etienne likes her so she does everything she can to make mer not jealous it's not mer's fault that she's not good enough for etienne and boy saint anna keeps reminding us that she's a good person 
 and poor ellie poor ellie etienne's girlfriend but surely it's ok for etienne to cheat on ellie with anna if she looks like a slut right 
 slutty nurse i don't believe it tiny white button-up dress red crosses across the nipples cleavage city 
 cheating is ok if your girlfriend is a bitch: that's the message that this book sends oh that ellie that stupid stuck up ellie ellie who thinks she is better than everyone else surely it's fine if etienne seeks comfort elsewhere if his girlfriend is a cold fish a stuck up snot right no i don't fucking think so how about you break up with her first just because a girl is a jerk doesn't mean she deserves to be cheated on i do not appreciate the way this book sends the message that it's morally acceptable to cheat on a girlfriend who neglects you but it's morally acceptable to cheat on her if you feeeeeeeeeeeeel bad about it right fuck this shit 
 the cheating: and yes it is cheating what do you call this 
 ""i said you were beautiful i slept in your bed"" 
 ""you never made a move you had a girlfriend"" 
 ""no matter what a terrible boyfriend i was i wouldn't actually cheat on her but i thought you'd know with me being there i thought you'd know"" 
 ok etienne has a girlfriend ellie etienne holds hands with anna he is still with ellie 
 it's nice holding hands comfortable 
 i wish friends held hands more often like the children i see on the streets sometimes i'm not sure why we have to grow up and get embarrassed about it 
 you know why because you wouldn't like it if etienne held hands with another girl if he was dating you fucking hypocrite 
 friends don't sleep in each others' beds 
 i mean i didn't sleep sleep with him obviously but i slept with him 
 i slept with a boy i burrow back down into my sheets and grin 
 and that boy has a girlfriend and then you do it again while he still has a girlfriend while you have an almost-boyfriend 
 you make eye contact and blush at each other in a theatre while he has a girlfriend 
 you kiss each other while he has a girlfriend while you have an almost-boyfriend 
 you flirt with each other while he has a girlfriend while you have an almost-boyfriend 
 i don't see this relationship lasting very long head's up: if any of you fuckers comment at the bottom of this review and say ""you don't understand bdsm"" i will hunt you down and make you eat your computer plus the mouse plus the keyboard plus any other internet-connected devices in your home including but not limited to iphones ipods ipads androids games consoles and ereaders this book is not an accurate or healthy portrayal of a real bdsm relationship between two consensual and enthusiastic parties thus by defending it as such you are doing a disservice to the actual culture of bdsm (no kinkshaming) so don't fuck with me and try to pull that shit 
 oh also there will be a substantial amount of cussing throughout this review if you care about the sanctity of your virgin eyes then shut down your computer and go do something else we are all grown-ass adults and this is the internet if you're going to come over and here and lecture me about swearing then i'd advise that you pipe the fuck down and stop being so bloody delicate 
 alrighty then you guessed it guys: it's story time 
 when i was thirteen i decided i wanted to be an author for years i'd chattered away about being an architect or a vet or what have you but who was i kidding all i ever wanted to do was write so i sat down and i did i did write 
 i'm actually not shitting you i thought it would be as easy as sitting down and writing some crap on wordpad (alright calm down this was the noughties) and i wrote a lot of crap: i tried to write a play and then i tried poetry and then i wrote short stories before eventually expanding into novels 
 novels is a stretch i wrote about a hundred single-spaced pages and to my present-day horror made my family read it and they actually did remember all those embarrassingly awful school projects you did when you were thirteen or even just those embarrassingly awful things you did in general when you were thirteen i feel the same level of shame when i think of my little preteen self handing this pile of shit over to my sister and thinking i actually had something 
 about a year later with zero knowledge of how publishing works i posted it straight into a bunch of indie publisher's slushpiles a vanity publisher replied to me and told me they didn't want my work and i did the undoable: i argued with them 
 as i write this i'm practically convulsing with embarrassment vanity publisher if you're reading this please forget i ever existed but if you can't do that at least give me an alias when you tell all your friends about that dumb kid who sent you the book about pyromania without having done any research 
 in some ways having read this book i finally feel like i identify with that vanity publisher: i read someone's irredeemable shit and hated it but then they tried to defend it and i got so mad i broke a window with my face 
 (peeps if you think el james hasn't tried to defend this shit then you need to get on youtube and watch some pleading vids from the publisher) 
 i just 
 i haven't read a book this awful since revealing eden (but let's not open that can of worms) it was like an acid trip am i reading this i thought is this actually a published book are people actually parting with money for this slab of steaming garbage 
 i feel like this book insulted me really i feel like it spat in my face because what reader-respecting author would create a protagonist this redundant and awe-inspiringly dense expecting an audience to love and respect her it's as if someone took an ice-cream scoop and relieved ana of her brain how could you why would you why is she 
 i just 
 i have no words i have no words to explain this protagonist none at all i have more to say about the love interest who's like a more threatening charles manson but with only one brainwashed follower (ana) this guy goes to the hardware store and buys like chains and lime and shit and ana doesn't think this is weird 
 what the fucking fuck 
 and of course there's the whole ""inner goddess"" shit and ana thinking that it's sexy to wear a chunky knit sweater and be strapped into a vehicle and then using the word ""vagina"" during a sex scene 
 ""oh he touched my vagina"" 
 yeah excuse me while i tame my boner 
 i felt so uncomfortable reading this book now let's be honest here: i read porn of course i read porn anyone over sixteen who says they've never looked at or read porn is talking out of their ass but this book made me feel uncomfortable and here's the kicker: i read it alone i was reading it alone in my living room and i felt uncomfortable inside my own head what the fuck does that tell you 
 i don't want to start yammering on about the way this book is written it's written like horrendous fanfiction there are spelling and punctuation errors stupid turns of phrase random asides stilted dialogue awful physical descriptions weird pacing and i don't know like a thousand instances of brand dropping and band-naming which gives the book this bizarre cheap and dated quality that really takes away from what little redeeming features it might have had 
 what are the redeeming features i don't know the blurb sounds interesting that's about it 
 but what is it about this book that's captured the attention of so many millions of people across the world the absurdly stupid protagonist the pushy obsessive totally unrealistic love interest the relationship in which only one party is actually interested in bdsm and the other is incredibly resistant to it but is forced into it the terrible writing the awful cover art the cheap thin binding a story so convoluted so ridiculous so totally immature it could only ever have been born from twilight 
 there is nothing enjoyable about this book this book is garbage there are no two ways about it: it is shit awful awful shit and i'm not sorry for saying so this is my fucking opinion and i'm damn well going to voice it 
 this book can kiss my ass i received an early copy of this book mysteriously in the mail i read it in one sitting okay two i have a small bladder 
 when i was finished i messaged the author to let her know how much i loved this book then i ripped out all the pages that had the number three in the page number page 3 page 13 page 23 page 33 (my fave) page 43 page 53 page 63 page 73 and so on and so forth 
 once i had all the pages successfully torn out of the book i proceeded to write on each of the pages in blood-red sharpie for example on page three i wrote ""this is how many months we were together you jerk"" 
 and on page 13 i wrote ""this is how many times we fought"" 
 and on page 23 i wrote ""this is how many times you held my hand"" 
 and on page 33 i wrote ""this is how many consecutive days i cried after you broke up with me"" 
 once i had successfully written something on each page i had ripped out of the book i stapled them all together and mailed them to my ex-boyfriend 
 i was arrested a week later but i don't think that had anything to do with this book i'm still giving this book five stars because it was really good lance is here 
 read on for an excerpt from pucked off: 
 i've agreed to go out with lance on a date two actually i don't even know what to think i grab my purse and slip into my jacket as fall settles in and the temperature drops layers are becoming necessary 
 when i return lance is standing at the desk checking his phone he's smiling 
 ""ready to go"" i say 
 he hits a couple of buttons pockets his phone and turns that grin on me ""cool"" 
 i lock up the clinic and lance walks me across the lot this time he doesn't leave the usual space between us and the back of his hand grazes my hip 
 i'm nervous when we reach my car his hummer is parked right behind my mini this time i adjust the strap of my purse and look up at him strangely he looks as nervous as me 
 he scans my face and takes a small step closer i can see his hand lifting in my peripheral vision my hair is in a ponytail which is sitting on my shoulder he fingers the end of it 
 ""why do i always want to pull this"" 
 i don't have the opportunity to answer because he drops his head and his lips skim my cheek 
 ""i want to kiss you"" 
 ""you just did"" i whisper 
 ""i want do it again but here"" his thumb touches my bottom lip 
 ""oh"" 
 he's so close his lips almost touching mine as he asks ""can i do that"" 
 ""yes please"" 
 his lids grow heavy and he kisses the corner of my mouth lance strokes my cheek and rests his palm on the side of my neck the other hand skims the length of my arm until he reaches my fingertips 
 he leans back a little and for a second i think it's over before it's even begun but he takes my hand in his uncurling my fingers he lifts it and presses my palm against his cheek a full-body tremor runs through him and his eyes drift closed he turns his head toward my palm and i smooth my thumb along the contour of his bottom lip a deep sound comes from the back of his throat making my skin prickle and heat blossom in my belly 
 when he opens his eyes again the fire in them matches the heat flooding my entire body ""can you keep yer hand right here"" 
 ""if you want me to yes"" 
 ""i definitely do"" 
 he leans in and brushes his lips over mine again it's soft and warm the next time he takes my bottom lip between his he releases it slowly and then does the same with the top one when his tongue flicks out i might whimper light fingers cup my head and i tilt it back farther 
 i part my lips and his tongue sweeps my mouth his groan is low sending a shiver down my spine he drops the hand that's keeping mine pressed against his cheek his arm winds around my waist and he pulls me in tight against him 
 i expect the kiss to grow in intensity it doesn't though i can feel the heat building inside me that feeling i've been searching for all these years is finally back

 kobo: http://tinyurlcom/jx62v3a i'm not sure what to write about this book the reviews for the book were sooo incredibly misleading i thought travis was going to hit her or come close the way everyone was going on about the 'abuse' in the book i get it it was intense but having seen real abuse with my own eyes in real lifei didnt understand what everyone else saw that made it be worse and stand apart from all other books 
 this is a book about an alpha male just because it's not a paranormal book and instead a contemporary it's not ok for him to act like that i'm a pretty (very) conservative person and i've read paranormal books where the guys act worse than that 
 abby was the one who got on my nerves the most throughout the book for jerking travis around all the time 
 it's a book and only a book and i enjoyed it i think i'll stop reading reviews before i read a book everyone is entitled to their opinion but i don't want to deterred from a book again i want to make my own decision :) and in my opinion i loved travis 
 great book jamie life is not roses all the time and everybody can change i haven't actually read this book and i don't plan to i was on my way to wal-mart but i took a wrong turn and ended up here at goodreads instead i only clicked 5 stars on this book because i think that's how you get more lives on this game i'm out of lives someone send me some more lives please i'll go give some more books 5 golden stars and hopefully i won't have to start from level one again 
 edited 7/17/17: are you f*cking kidding me i just got a new phone and this game was deleted from my phone i had to start over at level one does anyone know how to get a refund on this game ok so this is the midnight sun that twilight fans never got *trigger warning: this review contains strong themes to include rape* 
 before i begin what will likely become a very long rant/public service announcement let me first say a few words i have nothing against el james nothing she's said that this series is a fantasy she managed to put on paper and that she never expected it to gain such momentum good for her for perusing her dream of writing 
 if this book also fulfills one of your fantasies or if you just plain enjoyed it good for you too this review is in no way meant to belittle or condemn you for liking these books and nor is it an attack on the author these are solely my opinions about how dangerous fsog is to society and specifically to women 
 needless to say this book does not fulfill one of my fantasies it's pretty much my biggest nightmare 
 ""but it's just fiction"" 
 no you can't use that argument with me not anymore this book is not ""just fiction"" this book has become a frigging phenomenon as i write this over 70 million copies have been sold in the united states alone hardware stores have run out of ""natural fiber"" rope and there are even 'bdsm for beginners' classes cropping up in small town america 
 so excuse me but i can't just read this and think of it like a fantasy not when it's become a reality for so many people and not when i was so enraged by what i found within it 
 okay everyone take a deep breath grab a cup of coffee or a glass of wine and settle in we're going to be here for a while first up is probably the most inflammatory of the statements i'm going to make so we might as well rip the band aid off 
 this book perpetuates the rape culture we were all raised in 
 there i've said it i'm not taking it back and i'm not apologizing if you're unfamiliar with this phrase allow me to elaborate wikipedia defines rape culture as: 
 ""a term used within women's studies and feminism describing a culture in which rape and other sexual violence (usually against women) are common and in which prevalent attitudes norms practices and media condone normalize excuse or encourage sexualized violence"" 
 let's look at the first half of that definition as much as we may want to ignore the facts rape and sexual violence are common in america according to rainn the nation's largest anti-sexual violence organization someone in the us is sexually assaulted every 2 minutes on average that's about 207754 sexual assaults each year 54% of sexual assaults are not reported 97% of rapists will never spend a day in jail and 2/3 of these assaults are committed by someone known to the victim 
 i could go on for days about how prevalent attitudes practices and the media condone sexual violence but i won't because i'm really going to try and keep my words and links relevant to fsog thankfully throughout my research i found severalhundred 
 the university of california has an interesting article about how social and cultural norms perpetuate rape and rape culture in it they specifically address how women are conditioned from early ages to be passive and accept and affect certain attitudes and behaviors here are some of the social rules they list and elaborate on: 
 1 when spoken to a woman must acknowledge the other person with a gracious smile 
 2 women must answer questions asked of them 
 3 women must not bother other people or make a scene because they are uncomfortable 
 4 when in trouble it is best to defer to the protection and judgment of men 
 5 casual touching or suggestive comments in social settings are meant as a tribute to a woman's desirability 
 6 it is the natural state of affairs for men to carry the financial burden of social situations 
 7 when engaged in a social encounter it is not proper for a woman to superior in any game sport or discussion if she wants to be accepted 
 8 women should always accept and trust the kindness of strangers if they offer help 
 there's a blog post by harriet jacobs that also speaks to this and i urge you to read it in its entirety in short it says ""women are raised being told by parents teachers media peers and all surrounding social strata that: 
 * it is not okay to set solid and distinct boundaries and reinforce them immediately and dramatically when crossed (""mean bitch"") 
 * it is not okay to appear distraught or emotional (""crazy bitch"") 
 * it is not okay to make personal decisions that the adults or other peers in your life do not agree with and it is not okay to refuse to explain those decisions to others (""stuck-up bitch"") 
 * it is not okay to refuse to agree with somebody over and over and over again (""angry bitch"") 
 * it is not okay to have (or express) conflicted fluid or experimental feelings about yourself your body your sexuality your desires and your needs (""bitch got daddy issues"") 
 * it is not okay to use your physical strength (if you have it) to set physical boundaries (""dyke bitch"") 
 * it is not okay to raise your voice (""shrill bitch"") 
 * it is not okay to completely and utterly shut down somebody who obviously likes you (""mean dyke/frigid bitch"") 
 now how do these two examples relate to fsog simply put ana the main character in this series continuously exhibits the behaviors listed in the rules and seems to have the mentality of those listed in the bullets she might as well be the case study on which both were based 
 early in the book there's an interaction between her and a young man named paul the son of the couple she works for this is someone she says has ""always been a buddy"" just after they greet each other with a hug ""he releases me but keeps a possessive arm draped over my shoulder i shuffle from foot to foot embarrassed it's good to see paul but he's always been overly familiar"" 
 does she tell him that she's uncomfortable or step out from beneath his arm no that'd be going against everything that rule number three has taught her plus she wouldn't want to come across as a ""mean bitch"" now would she 
 just after this paul asks her out ""whenever he's home he asks me on a date and i always say no it's a ritual"" is it a ritual or is it something more than that has ana like many of us been conditioned to follow the rules to such a degree that she doesn't know how to tell him ""it's not okay to keep asking me out"" is she so terrified of breaking cultural norms and coming across as a mean-crazy-angry-dyke-shrill-frigid bitch that she'll put up with his pursuit of her indefinitely or does she just not know to put a stop to it because she hasn't been taught to 
 when she turns him down yet again he goes on to say ""ana one of these days you'll say yes"" creeped out yet you should be how does ana respond to this declaration by escaping the room they're in and getting back to a crowded store floor what does this tell us she felt the need to flee she felt the need to not be alone with him part of her clearly recognized the danger of the situation and the repeated advances of her ""friend"" but instead of speaking up she fled 
 she never voices her discomfort she is the submissive quiet person that society has taught her to be and 70 million people have read about her and have had these dangerously passive behaviors reinforced yet again through her actions behaviors and words (or lack thereof) 
 how will this same mentality play out in a situation involving sexual assault i can tell you because just a few chapters later she's sexually assaulted by another of her ""friends"" 
 ""jose i'm okay i've got this"" i try to push him away rather feebly 
 ""ana please"" he whispers and now he's holding me in his arms pulling me close 
 ""jose what are you doing"" 
 ""you know i like you ana please"" he has one hand at the small of my back holding me against him the other at my chin tipping back my head holy fuckhe's going to kiss me 
 ""no jose stop - no"" i push him but he's a wall of hard muscle and i cannot shift him his hand has slipped into my hair and he's holding my head in place 
 ""please ana carino"" he whispers against my lips he gently trails kisses along my jaw up to the side of my mouth i feel panicky drunk and out of control the feeling is suffocating 
 ""jose no"" i plead i don't want this 
 luckily ana is spared further abuse because the one and only christian grey arrives on the scene and saves her how by saying ""i think the lady said no"" that's right ana can try to push jose away and tell him 'no' multiple times but that's not good enough one sentence from a man and jose immediately releases her bringing us back to rule number four: when in trouble it is best to defer to the protection and judgment of men you got that ladies don't try to fight back because you'll just be ignored rely instead on a man sort of a catch 22 when the one who's going to get you into trouble will likely also be a man 
 bear in mind that this little scene takes place in the parking lot outside of a crowded bar just a shout away from salvation you're probably wondering why ana didn't scream why she didn't fight harder well i'd like to bring up harriet jacob's blog post again because just after her ""bitch list"" she says this: 
 ""if we teach women that there are only certain ways they may acceptably behave we should not be surprised when they behave in those ways 
 and we should not be surprised when they behave these ways during attempted or completed rapes 
 women who are taught not to speak up too loudly or too forcefully or too adamantly or too demandingly are not going to shout ""no"" at the top of their goddamn lungs just because some guy is getting uncomfortably close 
 women who are taught not to keep arguing are not going to keep saying ""no"" 
 women who are taught that their needs and desires are not to be trusted are fickle and wrong and are not to be interpreted by the woman herself are not going to know how to argue with ""but you liked kissing i just thought"" 
 women who are taught that physical confrontations make them look crazy will not start hitting kicking and screaming until it's too late if they do at all 
 nobody obtains the superpower to behave dramatically differently during a frightening confrontation women will behave the same way they have been taught to behave in all social professional and sexual interactions"" 
 eerie isn't it i sure thought so hopefully by now you're beginning to understand the inflammatory statement this all started with 
 not only do ana's actions and behaviors throughout the book reinforce the horrible societal conditioning that i mentioned earlier but this series also contains a lot of the other facets of rape culture like victim silencing for instance once she's collected herself this happens: 
 ""turning i glance at jose who looks pretty shamefaced himself and like me intimidated by grey i glare at him i have a few choice words for my so-called friend none of which i can repeat in front of christian grey ceo ana who are you kidding he's just seen you hurl all over the ground and into the local flora there's no disguising you lack of ladylike behavior"" 
 that's right folks it isn't ladylike to yell (shrill bitch) it isn't ladylike to swear (crazy bitch) it isn't ladylike to defend yourself after you've just been sexually assaulted (mean bitch) leave that to the menfolk surely they'll defend you surely they'll be the ones to address the fact that you were just sexually assaulted men you know the other sex the ones that have been raised to talk about emotions in public 
 and while we're discussing this scene we can't forget about rule number eight: women should always accept and trust the kindness of strangers if they offer help that's what christian is to her at this point in the book a stranger she's seen him only three times in formal or work-related settings and knows nothing about him other than he's rich good looking and that his shopping list resembles those of serial killers (i'll get to that last part later in the review) but accept his help and trust his kindness she does she lets this complete stranger remove her from the bar assuming that as he's just saved her from a sexual assault he's not planning one of his own 
 when she wakes up in his suite the next morning pantsless by the way she accuses christian of stalking her he defends himself by saying: 
 ""if i hadn't come to get you you'd probably waking up in the photographer's (jose's) bed and from what i can remember you weren't overly enthused about him pressing his suit"" he (christian) says acidly 
 pressing his suit i glance up at christian he's glaring at me eyes blazing aggrieved i try to bit my lip but i fail to repress my giggle 
 ""which medieval chronicle did you escape from you sound like a courtly knight"" 
 you got that stalking's okay because it's better than being raped 
 *facepalm* 
 i'm almost at a loss at how to address the rest of this without copious amounts of swearing how little she's concerned with her ""friend's"" behavior is appalling that there's no thought on her end about christian's allusion to her rape escape is appalling how she glosses over it all and makes a fucking joke about it is appalling it continues by the way 
 ""i would have been fine i was with kate"" 
 ""and the photographer"" he (christian) snaps at me 
 ""jose just got out of line"" i shrug 
 a shrug is a dismissive gesture just in case you were wondering she dismisses sexual assault as 'getting out of line' she downplays the severity of what happened why does she do this because it's awkward to talk about it because it's scary to think that someone she knows and trusts assaulted her and that when she tried to push him away and said 'no' he ignored her guess what it's always going to suck to talk about it's always scary to realize that statistics say that if you're raped you'll know your attacker but we need to talk about these things because if we don't nothing will ever change 
 and now the grand finale victim shaming and blaming you see jose feels bad for what he did at first ana is pissed at him as she should be and even after he calls her numerous times and leaves several messages she continues to ignore him deciding to ""let him stew"" then the next day this happens: 
 ""the memory of jose's attempted kiss haunts me i'm beginning to feel a bit cruel not calling him back"" 
 she feels cruel she feels cruel for not returning the calls of the man that forced himself upon her well of course she does she's been trained to be gracious and polite he's addressing her rule number one has taught her that she should smile in this situation so it would make sense that she feels bad for not doing so 
 two days later they talk: 
 ""can i see you i'm sorry about friday night i was drunkand youwell ana - please forgive me"" 
 ""of course i forgive you jose just don't do it again you know i don't feel like that about you"" 
 here's where i start to get really angry ""and you"" what exactly were there were breathing had tits how can jose's behavior in any way be blamed on ana this is the ""she deserved to be raped because she was wearing a skirt"" mentality that needs to be burned from our collective minds no one can ever make you do anything everything you do every way you behave is a choice that you and you alone make so no there is no ""and you"" 
 books like this with scenes like the ones i've spoken about only perpetuate our silence our ignorance our discomfort and our complicity they reinforce unhealthy behaviors and thinking patterns and they perpetuate rape culture 
 authors i beg you don't cover tough issues and strong themes if you can't do them justice grant them the depth and the severity they deserve please 
 this review can also be found at the alliterates i'm the author of this ya-m/new adult novel :) rating: negative sixty septillion stars 
 it's national book lovers day a day to bask in the amazing power of books to inform amuse educate and alter our views and viewpoints this book is my jam jane austen is my jam i love everything about her and this book read this book that is all he's the hottest korean i've ever seen 
 not that i have much experience with koreans but all the ones i've encountered couldn't even be considered in the same realm as sophie's brother 
 this is not a book for k-pop lovers it is a book about a superior condescending american and how she spreads her knowledge to the poor ignorant k-pop star 
 ""she doesn't play any instrument"" yoon jae provides ""she just knows everything about music"" 
 ""that's not true"" i say but i can't help smiling at his blind confidence in me ""i only know a few things"" 
 ""would you be interested in helping me with a new song"" jason asks 
 this book is the k-pop equivalent of the last samurai let me explain the last samurai is widely held as the movie that displays a prime example of western superiority long story short: white guy goes into japan without knowing anything the language the culture the combat styles out-samurais all the japanese dudes wins the heart of the fairest japanese woman in the village 
 this book can pretty much be described in the same manner white girl goes into south korea not knowing the language the customs improves the k-pop industry wins the heart of the hottest k-pop idol in the land 
 bullshit absolutely bullshit this book displays the stereotype of the ugly american at its worst the main character is condescending views everything foreign as ""exotic"" is completely unwilling to learn and appreciate the culture and steadfastly clings onto her own standards without embracing the new american tourists have a pretty bad reputation abroad and the main character in this book displays no deviation from that stereotype 
 this book mocks korean culture from the way the people smells to the heavy accent to the squat toilets to the language to the formalities within the culture 
 ""why are there so many different levels of formality"" i ask jason praying he's feeling gracious ""i don't get it"" 
 ""it has to do with respect"" he says shocking me ""you want to give respect to people who have authority over you or are older"" 
 ""okay i get that but seven levels really"" 
 he doesn't answer 
 ""it's dumb"" pops out of my mouth before i can stop it and i mentally kick myself just what i need--to insult the language of the country i just moved to 
 if you are expecting a lot of k-pop loving as i did be prepared for severe disappointment 
 i don't have the nerve to tell him his music is heartless mass-produced fluff 
 the main character's superior attitude towards k-pop and korean music makes me want to gag 
 ""but you think i should make it more like your american music"" he asks 
 ""you say that like it's a bad thing"" 
 this book made me rage i wouldn't recommend it for k-pop fans i wouldn't recommend it for any kind of light summery read it just gave me a headache 
 as a side note: it's kind of stupid to rant about a book involving k-pop so allow me to give myself some credibility i've been a k-pop fan for a long-ass time since before some of your oppas were even born i started with shinhwa (and suffered their departure) i loved dbsk (and i witnessed with much heartbreak their departure) i fell in love with exo (and was absolutely heartbroken at the demise of exo-moh luhan;_;) 
 there may be a trend here 
 in any case i know my freaking k-pop i've bopped to hot's candy and i danced along to bonamana i attempted to do growl but only ended up looking like a freakishly incompetent cowboy i'm well-read on korean culture i'm well up-to-date on k-pop current releases and i consider myself if not an expert very very well-informed on the k-pop scene just keep me out of your flame wars i ain't an elf i ain't a cassie i ain't a baby leave me out of your drama i'm here for the music 
 since i'm accusing the main character of elements of racism let me first be fair let's address the huge fucking pink elephant in the room korean culture and k-pop is not innocent when it comes to racism i am not speaking for all koreans by any means and i understand that every culture is guilty of feeling racially superior to some extent but the k-pop world is peppered with racism particularly when it comes to darker-skinned races and people 
 this denigration of darker-skinned people is not limited to foreigners even koreans who are darker-skinned get mocked (like the beautiful golden-skinned kai of exo who has been constantly given a hard time for his darker skin tone) snsd members have mocked a member whose skin is darker calling her dirty-looking there are rampant examples in which k-pop idols have dressed up in blackface (and nobody thinks anything of it) and there are numerous examples in which idols have made highly racist statements without any serious repercussion from society whatsoever 
 so there you have it racism does exist in south korea but that's not to say we should emulate it we should strive to be better an eye for an eye is not the answer here you cannot solve racism by being racist in return 
 look i'm not fucking mother theresa i'm a jerk so it should say something when i feel like we should maybe try to get along 
 open k-pop discussion in the comments go 
 quotes were taken from an uncorrected proof subject to change in the final edition finished ugly love in exactly 24 hours couldn't put it down so good now i know what all the fuss is about with colleen hoover books can't wait for the movie :) warning: f-bomb laden and spoiler ridden rant ahead reader discretion is advised 
 jesus fucking rollerblading christ 
 no fuck no i can't do it anymore you wanna read a historical love story with imperfect main characters go read karleen koen's dark angels 
 you wanna read a story about how fucked up stalin and the soviet union were pre during and post wwii go read the gulag archipelago 1918-1956 
 you wanna read an in-depth history of the european campaigns of wwii go read the guns at last light: the war in western europe 1944-1945 
 you wanna read a book about two of the most self-centered assholes in the history of literature read this book 
 we meet our female lead tatiana the day the nazi's invade russia her family freaks the fuck out like everyone else in the country does and they immediately spring into action sending their only son to ""safety"" other family members to get money out of the banks and their idiot youngest daughter tatiana to go get food to stockpile does she understand the severity of the situation no she fucking reads for a little while after everyone leaves because she never gets alone time 
 okay so that might be understandable because the girl is sixteen and has no idea what the reality of war is like (<- this is what i told myself to keep from getting pissed) then when she finally does go to get food she starts to notice that there are lines everywhere and places are sold out of the things she barely remembers that they need 
 imagine fucking that 
 of course she starts to frantically run around the city in fucking high heels and a pretty dress because it was sunday and she wanted to look nice how dafuq you gonna carry that much food in ill-fitting heels tania you think about that no no you fucking didn't you were too preoccupied with looking pretty you vapid little nitwit 
 so running around running around ""i have to catch this bus to get to the next grocery store in time but oh is that ice cream"" no no you are not going to stop and eat fucking ice cream right now (<-this is my disbelief talking) but oh yes yes she fucking is because she is a self-centered asshole 
 it's while sitting on a bench and eating her ice cream her beautiful long blonde hair flowing around her in the summer breeze that she meets the second most self-centered asshole in the history of literature alexander belov guess what he's hot he also saves her day by letting her into the officer's section of the grocery store so she can buy supplies to her heart's content then he and a buddy carry them all home for her because she can't because she's in fucking heels and has blisters 
 imagine fucking that 
 and so begins the basis of their entire relationship it can be summed up in one quote: 
 ""she needs me so much to take care of her and i desperately need to take care of her"" 
 that's it that's the entirety of this ""love"" story it's nothing but tatiana being a fucking tstl little mary sue and alex playing the fucking white knight to her damsel in distress 
 i know what you're thinking 
 welp sorry to break the news but 
 so alex and dimi his rat of a friend help tania bring the supplies home and lo and behold what do we discover that the handsome soldier our female lead has been lusting after is actually dating her sister 
 meet dasha the only decent person in the first two hundred pages of this book (that's as far as i got) because dasha is a good person she gets completely fucked over wanna know how her boyfriend and sister proceed to fall in love behind her back 
 does alex realize what's happening and do the right thing by breaking up with her hell no he's a self-centered asshole remember he's also a fucking sadist because he parades his relationship with dasha in front of tatiana who he secretly sees every fucking day 
 does tatiana tell her sister what's going on hell no she's a self-centered asshole remember she's also a fucking masochist because she continues to see alex even with him dating her sister and acting like a monumental douche 
 so that's it self-centered asshole sadist with a hero complex meets self-centered asshole masochist with princess syndrome they fall in love and their theme song is fuck everyone else they'll probably dance to it at the wedding wide smiles on their asshole faces as they fucking tango across the graves of those they sacrificed on the altar of their love 
 this review can also be found at the alliterates really impressed with this one cute romance funny dialogue and the format/illustrations made this even more fun and unique i also thought this book did a fantastic job at balancing the lightheartedness with the more serious stuff personally i could've done with a bit more resolution at the end--it felt a little rushed and i would've liked to linger for a few more pages also there were some things that didn't quite add up when i stopped to think about them but i was able to suspend my disbelief and just go with it 
 overall i thought this was a fantastic debut novel funny and sad and romantic all at once definitely recommended especially if you like cute unique contemporary i finally did it and i loved it teaser scene #1---> http://bitly/1cpbx20

 watch my interview with morgan matson here: https://wwwyoutubecom/watchv=yvqhe 
 morgan matson definitely did not disappoint with this book filled with books dogs ice cream scavenger hunts and a swoon-worthy new romantic interest clark the unexpected everything was an addictive read i love the message of this book learning how to live in the moment and all of the characters were strong and (some of them) easy to love also clark what a babe a nerdy beautiful babe 
 i definitely recommend this and all of morgan matson's other books especially during summer why the fuck is the average rating for this book like 43 when i spent 75% of the book wanting to bash the stuffings out of the main love interest with a rusty one-pointed morning star 
 but ugh since everyone loves it allow me to present my version of it 
 if the duke demands - khanh's version 
 *main characters* 
 trent: duke main love interest stodgy and with a stick in his ass bigger than the washington monument 
 miranda: an orphan who runs an orphanage in case the author hasn't made her life tragic enough yet she also does things like rewrites shakespeare so that hamlet contains pirates 19th century manic pixie dream girl 
 robert and quinn: trent's siblings and major fuckbois 
 lady jane: trent's aspired future duchess she is very chill perfection like a polar pop 
 lady diana: robert's love interest her hair is the color of afternoon light on a field of wheat 
 act---oh who the fuck are we kidding let's just get on with it 
 *ahem* 
 miranda: oh my god oh my god tonight's my chance to totally bone robert the man i've loved my entire life and how better to do it than to sneak into his room and seduce him he'll totally see me as a woman then what could possibly go wrong 
 trent: *sighs mournfully* i am so burdened by the ducal office it sucks all this responsibility and i feel such guilt you know because i practically killed my dad and all and by killed my dad i mean i wasn't there to say goodbye to him after he was injured in a tragic accident that nobody could have foreseen and to make it worse i killed my dad/failed to say goodbye to him because i was in bed with an actress to compensate for my failure i will be totally perfect and marry only a respectable woman and not do shady shit like meet a chick for a tryst in her room at all 
 miranda: **as lady rose** well hellooooooooooo 
 trent: damn bitch gimme some of that pussy 
 *bow chicka bow wow* 
 trent and miranda: oh fuck what the fuck are you doing here 
 trent: i've known you since you were 12 what the fuck who could have foreseen that at age like 19 or something that you'd be a woman and have a woman's body what the hell who could have foreseen this 
 miranda: oh fuck oh fuck oh fuck i should have thought this through ok we'll both forget about this ok 
 trent: yeah i mean totally i need to find a real duchess and totally not you cause i know my dead dad won't approve so how about we help each other i'll halfheartedly help you win my brother robert who is courting the lovely diana whose hair is the color of starlight upon a blade of grass in midsummer 
 miranda: deal in return i'll help you find the perfect duchess despite the fact that i'm a simple country girl who has no idea who the fuck is in the aristocracy and no idea how the fuck to conduct myself in the ton 
 act whatever 
 miranda: oh my god we're in town i'm gonna flitter about being an unpredictable little lady and everyone will love me because i'm just so fucking special and delightful 
 trent: god she's hot how did i not realize she was so hot but whatever i'm here to court the lovely and cool-headed lady jane 
 lady jane: ta 
 robert: oh my god it's lady diana she of hair the color of spun golden candy floss upon a stick of diamonds 
 miranda: my heart it is broken but damn trent is so cute how did i not notice how cute he is 
 trent: oh god i know i'm supposed to be helping you get my brother but hhhhhhhhnnnnnnnnnng damn girl you're hot let me put my hands under that skirt in front of all these people at a play let's hope nobody sees us and you won't get ruined cause i sure as hell ain't marrying you lol 
 miranda: oh no trent i can't why not instead of doing it in front of a theatre audience you try to finger me inside a moving carriage first 
 trent: deal and remember i'm not marrying you i want lady jane right lady jane 
 lady jane: ta trent 
 trent: god lady jane is so perfect so lovely so composed but if only she responds to my caresses the same way that little improper sprite does let me kiss lady jane and be sure 
 **one very proper kiss later** 
 lady jane: ta 
 trent: fuck she didn't even make me hard 
 act who the hell cares 
 miranda: oh my god all his wandering fingers have got me feeling tingly i know i'm not a proper duchess for him but i want to give myself to him take me trent 
 trent: you know i ain't gonna marry you bitch but yeah gimme that pussy 
 *the next night* 
 miranda: oh my god i'm so stupid how could i possibly have done that given my virtue to someone who will never marry me and who has ruined me whatever let's do it again 
 trent: yeah get over here gurl you know i'm still not gonna marry you right 
 **the next night** 
 miranda: what have i done i've fallen in love with him out of nowhere the only way to cure this is by fucking him again cause surely he'll see that i'm right for him by proving that i have self-control and that i have the miens of a duchess 
 trent: i'm not gonna marry you but i will have sex with you again 
 miranda: ok that's all i want *_* 
 **the next morning** 
 robert and quinn: oh fuuuuuuuuuuuuck trent you're fucking miranda yeah yeah you go bruh wait what were you thinking 
 trent: be quiet motherfuckers if you reveal this to anyone i'll fucking cut your balls and your allowance off i'm just fucking her i don't love her and will never marry her 
 miranda: **accidentally overhears** what *burst into tears* this is brand new information 
 trent: but i've been telling you this 
 miranda: *wails and runs away* 
 trent:  
 ugh i'm tired whatever they had a happy ever after ugh this book despite being a bit predictable i adored this book i love the characters and i sort of want to pick it back up and read it again i could have easily flown through this book in a day (if i'd had time) but i'm glad i took my time with it i really got to know the characters and i really liked the ending and how it contrasted the beginning of the story so beautiful brb crying from love and heartbreak because of this book this book wasokay it wasn't bad it did make me laugh and giggle a bunch which saved this book for me although there was a major downfall for me: 
 the first 100 pages were really good 
 the next 100 pages were slowing down and getting draggy 
 the next 219 pages went at a frustrating snails pace until finally the last page had what the whole book was leading up to 
 i am disappointed by love rosie because it could've been so much better if it wasn't so slow and draggy at the end i didn't like alex as much as i did when it started by the end he was almost like a stranger also the book was quite depressing at times which could've been more meaningful but i found myself not connecting to it since the events that made the novel sad were given to me second hand in letters & dms 
 i don't want to say it was a waste of my time because it was enjoyable at points but i just wish it was better since i don't read contemporary novels often so i went out on a whim with this one and was disappointed 
 the movie on the other hand was how the book should've been written slowly paced enough so you could fall for the characters but not so slow that you lost interest this is definitely a case where i like the movie better than the book 
 oh well i am not going to like every book 
 275/5 stars please someone tell me there is a second book this one was so good but i want moreeeee like i want to know what josh's future holds i want more thoughts before reading this book: ""i wonder what this book is about"" 
 thoughts while reading this book: ""holy hell batman"" 
 thoughts after reading this book: ""#j@$qiofaifjdslk%$uq#*"" 
 * this review was not paid for nor endorsed by the authors in fact they'd probably rather it not exist at all how do i get over that seriously how on earth do i get over such a phenomenal story 
 i'm just ::: stares into space grasping for words::: i'm overwhelmed overwhelmed by all i'm feeling and all i'm thinking i almost don't know where to start with this review and i most certainly feel as though i just had a moment a book moment one where i read something that affected me so deeply i can't even form words to describe it 
 i mean my first response after finishing was to release several breaths close my eyes and savor the moment the journey i had just gone on and then i had an immediate urge to go and re-rate other books i had read in the past because this story changes the way you see things this book pummels you in the feels and i'm here to tell you that i have 
 major feelings 
 for this book my feelings are so huge so massive so all encompassing they can barely be contained and because of that this review is going to be long-winded and a little all over the place so be prepared 
 first off before i even begin to get into things i want to say i was not expecting this i was not expecting the deep torturous gut you make you cry emotions that pucked off had in it i mean i am no stranger to this standalone series i have read pucked (which i loved) and i did read pucked up (which i unfortunately didn't totally love and because of that i passed on lily and randy's books that said i do plan to go back and read those now) so yes i know this series and it's always been light and sassy and kind of ott on the humor and so going into pucked off i was expecting the same light feels as before but no just no 
 no no no no nooooooo 
 lance's book is deep and ache inducing and completely heartfelt and it from the very first sentence steals the air from your lungs and traps you i was literally stolen from the first chapter it gave me a sensation of feeling fevered with the need the urge to know what was going to happen only a few books have done that to me in the past and this was absolutely in the ""group"" of reads that i would classify as unforgettable and i think so much of that had to do with lance romero 
 lance was one of the most breathtaking characters i have ever had the pleasure of reading this man destroyed me i mean de-fucking-stroyed me i had this clawing need to climb inside my kindle wrap my arms around him and love him love him deeply and thoroughlyuntil he knew he was an amazing book soul this man is broken so damn broken his past is full of demons that are haunting him and those demon's have shaped his perception of the world of who he is as a person and lance is barely getting by his view is so distorted that his destructive patterns are ripping him apart at the seams and things are coming close to not only affecting his career but his friendships his life his everything 
 lance though is the definition of a book boyfriend but not in the way you're thinking not in that over the top i am man i am alpha cookie cutter way we are used to no he is a book boyfriend because his struggle makes him feel real alive it gives him life to the reader and makes him relatable he is simply so easy to love because at his core this man is good he is all things that define good and you just can't stop yourself from falling it's a visceral overpowering sensation 
 but lance doesn't see himself as anything of worth and his behavior breaks you as a reader when this mystery girl enters the picture she breathes life into lance's dark world honestly this girl takes this book from spectacular to phenomenal she for me was one of the most incredible heroines i have ever read the way she dealt with lance even despite the pain he had caused her in the past (and oh yeah they have a past) was awe inspiring she was so sweet so generous kind smart and forgiving i was enthralled by her 
 reading lance's love story invigorated me as a reader lance's vulnerability when it comes to this mystery woman was refreshing and watching their relationship take shape inspired me and it made me realize why i love reading romance there is something so very profound about the concept of soulmates and i feel like that is what keeps me a romance reader the idea of having that one person that is destined to be yours and only yours 
 i just love it 
 and i love that sensation of falling in love as the characters fall it's intoxicating the way helena hunting wrote this book i felt as though i was living it it was palpable visceral tangible like i could reach out and touch this romance make it my own i swear i'm crazy in love with these characters their love story was raw and heartbreaking beautiful and life giving and that was because lance's mystery girl was so good and pure and lance who's broken and sad and desperate lets this woman in and allows her to inspire him to change and heal and choose a new way of living 
 god i hope that even makes sense lol but this was so much more than i was expecting and i was taken by how deep i fell in love with these characters i truly don't know what else to say except it's beautiful the story is so beautiful and i feel so romanced by it i just want to talk about it think about it and live in it forever 
 overall you can obviously tell that i am losing my mind over pucked off i more than loved it it's a standalone romance you can start the pucked series here really you can and if i were you i would i just think out of all the books that have come out of this series this is hands down the best the most real and heartfelt i give it infinite stars i know i will always think of this book when i think of my ultimate favorites romantic sweet heartbreaking and unforgettable lance romero is the reason books boyfriends exist and pucked off should be a mandatory read for every romance reader around phenomenal breathtaking it was everything 
 arc received in exchange for an honest review 
 follow me on: facebook | instagram | twitter | blog super cute and fun loved the first half but the second half felt a little all over the place overall it was lighthearted and sweet and exactly what i thought it would be i read this book back before el james even wrote it 
 i don't brag about a lot of things but my review skills are one of the few things i will brag about 
 el james read my review on this book and she loved it so much she decided to go ahead and write the book here is a word-for-word copy of our email exchange from that day 
 *** 
 el james: hello colleen hoover i saw your book review on fifty shades of grey and i loved it so much i decided i would write the book i'm already finished writing chapter twelve i just wanted to say thank you without your review i would never have found the inspiration for this book 
 colleen hoover: you're so welcome i'm great at this reviewing thing right 
 el james: you are take care 
 colleen hoover: laters baby 
 el james: that's brilliant i might put that in my book if you don't mind 
 colleen hoover: if you do don't give me credit for it i don't like attention i get so much already someday when you finish this book you'll know what it's like 
 *** 
 a few months following the above email exchange fifty shades of grey released and el james became a sensational author if you're a reviewer make sure you pre-review books before they are written procrastination is for losers q: what the ever-loving fuck is this shit 
 a: someone's rape fantasy 
 goddamn it look i'll admit i went into this book expecting to loathe it i hate-read every time i hit a book slump because it's the only way for me to get out of one but i in no way expected to be this enraged 
 let's start with the plot shall we the mc's brother rips off a biker gang and she's forced to become one of their sex slaves in order to save his life yup that's the fucking plot oh but it's not rape she has a choice you see she can choose not to become a sex-slavebut then they kill her brother you heard it here first forced sex through coercion isn't rape tell all your friends 
 ""you want to keep dumbass alive pack a bag and climb on my bike when we leave you do what i tell you when i tell you no questions and no bitching"" 
 ""why"" i asked blankly 
 ""why the hell do you think"" he said voice strained ""so i can fuck you"" 
 but it's not rape 
 ""this pussy is mine you are mine i'll fuck you when and where i want and you can either take it or get the fuck out are we clear"" 
 but it's not rape 
 ""you do this it's your choice i'm not raping you you're making a decision to pay for your brother's mistake on your back you get me"" 
 see it's not rape 
 me: 
 this epic piece of shiterature contains possibly the single worst female lead that i've ever had the misfortune to read about marie this chick is a horrifying amalgamation of every complaint i've ever had about every female lead i've ever hated all rolled into one insanely fucking stupid package 
 i can honestly say that reading about this chick was like sitting in a room full of misogynistic men and listening to them tell me all the reasons that they hate women she is the most stereotypically offensive female ever 
 and no i'm not fucking exaggerating 
 the book opens with her leaving her husband because he hit her she then goes on to slut shame the woman that he's currently sleeping with 
 ""i liked to think of misty as the whore which i wrote in all caps for all emphasis whenever i texted someone"" 
 let's just ignore the ""all emphasis"" portion of that sentence this book is horribly written and edited end of story instead let's focus on the definition of the word whore: ""a woman who engages in sexual acts for money"" does this woman exchange sex for money no so definitively she isn't a whore she's a ""whore"" in marie's mind because she's sleeping with her ex 
 are you fucking kidding me what the fuck is this thought process instead of feeling sympathy for this woman instead of wanting to warn her away from what will likely be an abusive relationship you slut-shame her he fucking hit you why are you angry that he's with someone else at all shouldn't you be elated that you escaped 
 way to be completely fucking brainwashed by society way to unintentionally be the perfect fucking victim way to continue this god-awful trend of women hating other women for no fucking logical reason way to be a fucking bestseller and continue to perpetuate these stupid fucking trends to the masses 
 it gets worse by the way marie walks into her house to find her brother nearly beaten to death and a bunch of leather-bound men standing over him one of which holds a gun to the back of his head any decent human being's reaction to this: 
 marie's reaction to this: 
 ""my brother knelt in the middle of our crappy living room bleeding and awaiting execution and all i could think about was me and horse what the hell was wrong with me"" 
 everything i hate you i hope that the bike you're about to ride on crashes and you're caught beneath it and slowly burn to death you horrible excuse for a character i'm sure you're thinking that goes too far that it's a little too much no it's not nearly enough i have all the rage that has ever raged 
 before i burst a blood vessel why don't we move on to horse the male lead yup his name is horse because he's hung like one mmm sexy huh umno a horse's penis can be anywhere from 25 - 35 feet long the average woman's vagina is 3-4 inches deep but can expand to 200% when fully aroused let's say marie has an above average vagina and is packing 6 inches of un-aroused heat fully expanded that's still only 12 inches a full foot and a half short at least i'm sorry ahead of time but all i can picture is this: 
 horse is one of the men that just beat the shit out of her brother does he seem remorseful no all he seems to be concerned with is marie and her vagtastic va-jay-jay he couldn't give a fuck about killing a man mmm sexy huh 
 *pukes* 
 jfc what is it with all these tattooed ragebeasts why are they a fucking thing are we that unevolved if you're a troll don't even bother answering that it was rhetorical this book's popularity is all the answer i need 
 so back to the matter at hand marie's in a bit of a bind what does she do about it 
 a)	call the cops 
 b)	make an excuse to leave the room and call the cops 
 c)	agree to their demands only until she has a chance to call the cops 
 d)	happily agree to be horse's sex slave and never once thinks about calling the cops 
 if you answered d congratulations you're correct i don't have a prize to give out but saving you from reading this failmance seems pretty good to me so you're welcome for that 
 marie's agreement leads us to the final thing i'd like to talk about; marie and horse's abusive abusive relationshit let me set the scene for you concerning their fist sexual encounter marie wakes up in bed having no recollection of how she got there someone has stripped her down to her panties and tank top behind her a boner for whatever reason this isn't an issue for her and she starts to fool around with - god i can't even believe i'm typing this - horse then this happens: 
 ""i shivered lust and desire bursting through me trying to see if i could lift my hips and move with him in the process i accidentally pushed against his chest which he apparently interpreted as me trying to push him away 
 horse pulled away from my mouth and growled eyes dark with desire and a need so strong i froze he looked like an animal in heat a point his hard prick seemed to be determined to impress in its own way 
 ""i'm in charge here don't forget it"" he stated"" 
 that's right he thinks she's trying to push him away and he doesn't respect that instead he gets forceful with her marie being the fucking idiot that she is is fine with this he then goes on to shove a finger up her ass without warning and then when his buddies walk into the house and she refuses to have sex with him because she doesn't want them to hear her he punches a hole in her wall slams her door so hard that he cracks the wood and walks out on her 
 she goes on to obsess about him 
 so i'm sorry i know a lot of people were enjoying my updates but i just can't with this fucking book blurring the lines when it comes to sexual assault is not something that i enjoy reading about sorry excuses for women is not something i enjoy reading about an emotionally abusive relationship is not something i enjoy 
 this review can also be found at the alliterates i hate this book 
 i hatehatehate it 
 i thought i was preparedand i wasto deal with a story depicting a forbidden and taboo relationship 
 but 
 but i was not prepared for this 
 i was not prepared to encounter something so pureso beautifulso tormentedsomething so stunning 
 i was not prepared for him 
 lochan 
 ----------------------------------------------------------- 
 hello readers 
 i find myself utterly captivated by terrible beauty this book possesses 
 i was disgustedi was exploitedi wepti screamed 
 but i could not stop 
 i became that proverbial moth who can't stop even though it knows it will burn 
 and i did burn 
 so tell me readershow do i explain lochan to youhow do i explain something so exquisitely beautiful in a few mere wordshow do i do it 
 i can't

 ""at what point does a fly give up trying to escape through a closed window - do its survival instincts keep it going until it is physically capable of no moreor does it eventually learn after one crash too many that there is no way outat what point do you decide that enough is enough"" 
 meet kit--- 
 a 13 year old being corroded away by painbitterness and hatredhe does everything to refute authoritydoes everything to drive lochan mad 
 meet tiffin--- 
 a beautifulspirited young boy who has to beg for every scrap of attention from his motherhe knows that when maya tells him that their mom actually cares about themshe's lying 
 meet willa-- 
 ""at the age of five she has already come to terms with one of the life's harshest lessons:that the world isn't fair"" 
 and now meet with maya--- 
 a 16 year old girl who has to play the role of a mother for those three younger siblingsbecause their mother is too drunk and selfish to even careand their father left them years ago

 ""i can't bear to think i might have lost our closenessour friendshipour trusthe was always so much more than just a brotherhe is my soul matemy fresh airthe reason i look forward to getting up every morningi always knew i loved him more than anyone else in the world"" 
 ----------------------------------------------------------- 
 yesshe loves lochanthe kind of love that has no boundarieswhich is endless 
 ""how can something so wrong feel so right"" 
 readersi will not try to justify their lovebecause no matter however i present it it will be a difficult concept to grasp 
 ""let's face itthis is all pretty sickmaybe the rest of the world's rightmaybe we're just a couple of fucked-upemotionally disturbed teenagers"" 
 so noi will not try to justify it 
 ""there are no lawsno boundaries on feelingswe can love each other as much and as deeply as we wantno onemayano one can ever take that away from us"" 
 ----------------------------------------------------------- 
 and nothing prepared me for the ending 
 ""at what point do you give up - decide enough is enough 
 there is only one answer really 
 never"" 
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
 i guess that's all for now'cause no matter what i doi will not be able to convey the beauty of this story to you 
 goodbye readers 
 ps-i love this book i have two copies of this book on my bookshelf i only read one of them and i really really loved it but i felt bad that i was neglecting the other copy so i decided to read it too but i started with the last word and read the whole book backwards i wouldn't recommend doing that it doesn't really make much sense and it takes longer to read the book back to front than it does front to back because our brains aren't used to working in reverse 
 if you read this book which i think you should i would highly recommend reading it front to back oh how i wish this book were an underground boxing match i've had so much fun thinking up names and special fighting techniques for brooke and remington 
 brooke ""the washout"" dumas weighing in at an arguably lithe 120lbs brooke's fighting style relies more on flexibility and trickery than sheer brute force having been denied her dream of olympic gold thanks to an injury brooke's had years to save up all her bitter rage and coil it into a tight ball of hate that she's stuffed in ""her core"" now she's wound tight and ready for action her hobbies are babbling incessantly about inane bullshit stretching and making stupid decisions turn ons are tacky tattoos muscles sweat and mood swings her special skills include an almost unrealistic ability to contort her body (she can turn her head around and kiss a guy on the mouth while in the doggystyle position) and an overabundance of vaginal fluid which she directs at unsuspecting opponents 
 seriously get that woman some depends before she kills someone 
 remington ""rageturd"" tate is just your typical musclebound gorilla 
 ragey's actual size is never stated but if my impressions are accurate he's roughly the size of a small barn left to fend for himself in the ""loony bin"" at the tender age of 13 ragey has learned how to fight fight fight his way to the top (of the orgy pile) his most valuable talent in the ring is his ability to throw out super pheromone which makes every straight female and gay male in a five mile radius stupid with lust senses are dulled and inhibitions are destroyed his hobbies include fighting yelling raging table flipping lamp smashing marking his territory with his urine and sniffing every woman of mating age in his general vicinity his turn ons are pert butts ""honeyed whiskey eyes"" and women with vaginal fluid imbalances 
 the book itself has its own killer instincts there are enough metaphors to sink a yacht and the staccato nearly reached fifty shades levels between that and the term ""my sex"" i was suffering some serious ""bad erotica"" flashbacks thankfully there was enough unintentional funny to keep me from completely losing (the rest of) my mind some of it is funny because the bad grammar makes it weird other parts are funny merely because someone not only thought them but thought they were good enough to put on paper for instance the first named opponent of ragey is a guy by the name of kirk dirkwood why that was so funny to me i couldn't tell ya but i did make a note in my kindle: ""why didn't she just go with clit dickwater"" 
 the various story arcs are usually pretty ridiculous in one twist brooke sees her younger sister nora ""in the underground"" this occurs during a match between remington and his arch-nemesis the scorpion last brooke knew nora was sending their parents postcards from australia but alas there she is on the scorpion's side of the ring looking strung-out pale skinnyand with a scorpion tattoo on her face 
 you know where that's going right well brooke has to rescue nora from snidely whiplash and since remington in a manic hissy fit bet ""all of his money"" that he'd beat scorpion in the ""underground championship""wouldn't it just be so unbelievably sweet if he threw the match to ensure nora's release from el scorpio 
 and now without further ado 
 ""my legs wobble and i'm left with the distinct impression this man wants to pound me next with his cock"" 
 ""he's so close the scent of him tears through me like a shot of adrenaline"" 
 ""i dip my head and murmur ""thank you"" and quickly leave and i want to die because i swear to god he just ducked his head to smell me"" 
 ""i'm still not recovered from seeing him up close and my blood stream already carries all kinds of strange bubbly hot little things"" 
 ""there is literally a ball of fire in my throat"" 
 ""and i'm so crazy about this man i just want to eat him up with a spoon"" 
 ""and an entire farm full of animals awaken in my stomach not just the butterflies"" 
 ""my head is spinning inside my cranium"" 
 ""i know for sure one hundred percent to the tenth power"" 
 at one point during their second sex scene brooke reaches down and feels the slickness of his 
 ""bloated crown"" 
  
 there's a part where brooke goes to see her sister and has to kiss scorpion's tattoo to get permission to speak to her well of course his ""goons"" take photos and of course those photos get sent to remington while he's eating breakfast in a hotel restaurant 
 my favorite scene in the entire book in 321 
 ""i can't read his profile but he has gone utterly still then it all happens in a blink of an eye"" 
 yes he flipsa table 
 and here's me after being introduced to a new euphemism for 'clitoris': 
 ""and at the first scrape of my nubbin against the rock-hard quad muscle of his thigh 
 i'll be serious for a minute i don't understand how anyone can enjoy writing like this i struggled to get through the writing was simplistic repetitive and amateur the dialogue was silly and the corn and cheese quotient went well beyond what anyone would count as acceptable there were moments when ms evans just abandoned any pretense at actual storytelling there are at least four instances where the story almost completely self-destructs and the book left me with more questions than it answered: 
 1 did brooke tear her acl twice or break her ankle 
 2 is pete's name pete or pedro 
 3 was the tension between melanie and riley because they hadn't slept together yet or because they had 
 4 did melanie go home without us being told one minute she's there the next she's not 
 5 why did remington after an entire books' worth of silence about his feelings go off for five fucking pages at the end about how much he lurves brooke 
 6 if a scorpion is an insect why does brooke refer to the scorpion as ""the reptile man"" 
 7 what the hell happened with remington's parents they showed up to see him but he refused and we never revisited that messy topic 
 8 how did nora manage to get rid of her tattoo and beat a cocaine addiction in a mere four weeks 
 9 how is it possible for one man to spend a few million dollars a year what is he spending all that money on 
 10 he told brooke he wants to be her ""real"" her real what real vagey boyfriend if so mission accomplished 
 11 why was there so much poetic waxing about how utterly perfect and god-like and sexy and male and sweet and vulnerable and damaged and fuck why 
 questions questions questions the most burning question however is how in the name of blackbeard's glory hole has this gotten so many high ratings

 ""nubbin"" - 2 okay i realized by people's comments that i never said exactly what i thought about this book well i loved it i've now read it four times christian grey ranks right up there with travis maddox in my book boyfriend world this series is addicting when i need a good read this is my ""go to"" series i didn't know what to think about this because i wasn't sure how i felt about bdsm but this is sooooo much more than that one of the best love stories i've read to date oh my goodness i don't think i'll ever be able to say it's better than the mortal instruments    but wowwww was this book absolutely amazing 
 this book was absolutely phenomenal i think it is some of cassandra clare's best work to date to the people who say all of cassie's books are the same i hope lady midnight finally shuts you up no more stories about ""orphaned girls who aren't aware of their supernatural powers"" (ps clary was never an orphan so i don't know why i keep seeing that associated with tmi) it was so wonderful to jump into the shadow world from a perspective we've never seen before here's a girl who's been a shadowhunter all her life who grew up with all of the customs we're so used to learning about throughout the past books who's already lived through a war and survived even though it's the same world it is so unbelievably different from anything i've read from cassie before given some of that may have to do with the fact that this is the first totally new and full novel i've read from cassie clare in 2014 but i do believe most of it is attributed to the fact that she's grown as a writer and story teller 
 from page one of this book i can already sense a level of sophistication and improvement in her writing there's an unfamiliar level of seriousness i haven't seen in the shadow world before it's intense it's insane and it's real the characters in this book seem way more grounded than our beloved tmi/tid cast i think some of that may have to do with the fact that there aren't jokes 24/7 (thought the comedy in this book is a+) but each character is extremely individual and realistic in my opinion i love absolutely all of them it was so strange to start a book knowing quite a bit about this group of characters before starting; that's a totally new experience for me 
 i will say this story was a bit slow to start the first 100-200 pages were kind of slow but i think it was more just getting used to a new world with new characters and a new story as soon as the book picked up i couldn't put it down from there on this book is a non stop thriller with everything you could possibly want from a new installment of the shadowhunter chronicles 
 lady midnight has taken the shadow world further than i've ever imagined i can't remember ever having so many theories for a series and i am just exploding with all of the new information that's revealed to us i'm halfway through the book thinking to myself ""i need queen of air and darkness now because i cannot wait until 2018 to know the truth"" this story went in so many directions i wasn't expecting at the start and i'm dying to see how things play out in the rest of the trilogy 
 that being said you definitely need to read all of cassandra clare's works prior to this because we get all the tmi and tid feels if there's one thing i love about cassie's books it's the way she's able to throw in references of our favorite characters so subtly and endlessly give us the satisfaction we desire from her previous books but that means for those of you who aren't totally caught up yet stay away because the spoilers are everywhere 
 all in all this book was absolutely fantastic i never realized how much i wanted from this book and cassie managed to fulfill all of those unconscious desires i had for the future of this world i can't remember the last time i loved a first book in a series this much if that review hasn't sold you i hit page 668 and turned directly to page one to start all over again lady midnight was absolutely phenomenal i'm so proud of cassie for never failing to disappoint me always being an insanely talented writer and continuing on with a world i know is so dear to her heart i hope you all absolutely adore lady midnight as i did and i cannot wait to post the spoiler-filled discussion i have prepared for my youtube channel: https://wwwyoutubecom/user/emmmabooks happy reading my fellow shadowhunters <3 
 *disclaimer- i was sent an advanced copy of this book by simon & schuster in exchange for an honest review all opinions included in this review as well as my future video are entirely my own* 3/4 last kiss book 2 of 2 the shocking conclusion & unraveling of reeves sallis & emily's cat-and-mouse game of seduction 
 ""i put myself back together as best as i could but i was sure that parts of me were broken permanently"" 
 books in first and last series should be read in order: 
 book 1: first touch 
 book 2: last kiss 
 in first touch (book 1) actress and tv sitcom star emily wayborn aka emily barnes sought out heir and hotelier with rumored mafia ties reeve sallis in hopes of seducing the truth out of him regarding her friends disappearance 
 but emily quickly became entwined in over her head with reeves' cat and mouse game of seduction falling for him while getting mixed signals and finding little proof of his innocence 
 last kiss (book 2) opens up to book 1's jaw-dropping ending recent shocking developments has emily torn between her past and her future; right and wrong; fear and courage; love and hurt; holding on or letting go 
 it's a roller-coaster of mixed messages danger conflicted feelings cover-ups misunderstandings addiction manipulation confusion betrayal deceit and ultimately truths 
 reeve sallis has come a long way since book one emerging is a matured refined alpha ready to face his past and claim his future nine words to describe reeve: larger-than-life elusive suspicious commanding; intense ruthless moody private and unyielding 
 nine words to describe emily wayborn aka emily barnes: smart determined self-doubting trusting confused wishy-washy reflective meek and resilient 
 last kiss from emily's pov is the suspenseful unraveling of a mystery and the final pieces in the puzzle of the enigma that has been reeve sallis 
 it's addicting frustrating shocking angsty and deceiving but above all it's living for the moments and basking in the glory of reeve sallis the ending is peace and healing but i'd welcome an epilogue a few years into their future 
 jaded devious enigmatic and panty-melting reeve sallis complex and suspenseful plot excellent story-telling i am sticking reeve on my top-10 hero shelf 
 ""a kiss that couldn't fade 
 a kiss that could go on forever 
 a kiss that could last 
 instead of what it really was--a last kiss""

 would i recommend this series: yes 
 would i re-read this series: yes 
 would i read future books by this author: yes 
 arc provided to me by author laurelin paige in exchange for an honest review so there's this popular girl her name is like gia she's 17 but has this totally hot junior boyfriend at ucla whom nobody has seen (statutory rape is so like 2000s which incidentally is practically the year in which gia was born) she got hot bradley to take her to prom only like at the last minute (literally in the parking lot y'all) he dumps her 
 why because she's a shallow bitch and only cared that hot bradley was like totally hot and her friends are gonna be like so impressed especially that bitch jules who's like trying to totally steal away all her friends because gia is the alpha of their group and we can't have that no really she's the alpha and that status is endangered 
 nice friends you got there"" 
 ""they're mostly nice jules is just constantly trying to oust me"" 
 ""why"" 
 ""i have no idea i think she thinks i'm the alpha of our pack and that there is only room for one without resorting to cannibalism"" 
 but she's not such a bad queen bee really gia and her friends only: 
 1 completely disregard anyone beneath her social spectrum 
 ""hi i'm sorry i don't know your name"" 
 he shrugged ""i've only been in four of your classes over the last three years why would you"" 
 my cheeks reddened had he really i looked at him again closer he honestly didn't look at all familiar to me except from prom the other night 
 2 slightly teases her close friends who aren't up to her standards she never bullies that's like so low-class 
 ""who needs money and good grades when you have community college"" claire said 
 ""exactly what i've been saying for the last four years"" laney said i could hear the embarrassment in her voice and i felt bad that school had been a struggle for her 
 such condescension such benevolence such pity she is the equivalent of lady catherine in pride and prejudice 
 so after suffering from the most horrible fate possible in the entire world (on prom night) gia is shit out of luck but luckily for her there's a totally hot guy just sitting in his car ripe for the plucking and pluck she does she sweet-talks fake bradley into being well fake bradley and taking her to prom instead 
 he takes her to prom her friends are understandably impressed because really which high school girl is going to think about statutory rape when the guy is like so hot except the girl who's trying to steal her friends cause she's all like smirking and scowling that her plans to take all the friends have gone to pieces 
 for now *sinister smile* 
 i wrapped my arms around claire and glanced at jules surprisingly she wasn't looking at me her stare was focused on the door that fill-in bradley had just exited through there was that familiar calculating look on her face and i wondered what was going through her mind i was sure of one thing--it wasn't good 
 so prom night goes swimmingly and she even gets to conveniently break up with fake bradley at the end of it which is great except now for some reason gia is really really fascinated by fake bradley if only she could find out fake bradley's real name and then real bradley resurfaces and maybe he wants to make up again 
 oh gosh what's a girl to do clearly gia has some #realproblems and her archnemesis jules is trying to expose everything via facebook and twitter and instagram 
 she pulled out her phone ""oh and while i'm online i wanted to leave mean messages on bradley's facebook page for what he did to you what's his last name again"" 
 here it was--her play i was surprised she had waited this long ""he isn't on facebook who goes on facebook anymore anyway"" he actually was on facebook but there was no way i was telling her that 
 ""so instagram twitter you showed me them before but i don't remember his handle"" she pushed 
 obviously she forgot tinder and maybe grindr possibly pinterest and yo too gotta cover all the bases y'know 
 but let's not get facetious gia's got some serious problems 
 i mean she has to: 
 1 find fake bradley 
 2 get fake bradley's sister (who goes to the same school with her whom she didn't know went to the same school much less class with her see note above about gia not giving a shit about anyone outside of her hallowed social circle) to give her fake brad's real name 
 3 decide what to do about real bradley 
 ""how is bradley anyway"" he gave me a sideways glance 
 ""i don't know i haven't talked to him since that night"" i'd been telling too many lies lately so i felt the need to add ""he texted me i tried to call him back and he didn't answer then he called me back but i missed it then i left a message for him i haven't decided if i'm going to call him again"" 
 4 try to prevent jules from knocking her off the #1 queen bee (sorry alpha) in her circle of friends 
 5 decide what to do what real bradley and fake bradley meet each other 
 her family only looks perfect her dad is understanding caring her mother is beautiful intelligent her brother is a little distant she's got some serious problems 
 ""what about you are you close with your family"" 
 ""yes"" i said right away but then i paused drew's words about how my parents hadn't really been there for me after i broke up with bradley coming into my mind i shook my head to get rid of the thought and then nodded ""yes"" 
 there is so much suffering so much hardship i can think of a thousand examples from the book in which her family is distant cruel uncaring oh wait i can't they're pretty much white-bread perfect 
 clearly you can see this book contains as much depth as is contained within kim kardashian's ample cleavage 
 actually now that i think about it that's pretty deep yo empece esta novela por la polemica y porque queria formarme mi propia opinion bueno pues ya lo he hecho y aqui esta ni siquiera voy a poner puntuacion porque creo que lo que pienso ya ha quedado lo suficientemente claro por mis comentarios me parece que esta mas a nivel de fanfic que de novela y podria haber mejorado muchisimo si alguien hubiera revisado los errores de estilo y las incoherencias (de argumento de contexto de personajes) porque no habria estado mal o tan mal sin embargo y siento decirlo este libro es un desastre 
 no me voy a extender con como esta escrito (mal nada unificado) ni de ritmo (*rolleyes*) ni de la trama que no lleva a ninguna parte (*inserte el meme de la negra*) porque paso ya se ha dicho y volver sobre eso me parece un rollo ademas estoy segurisima de que hay gente muchisimo mas indicada que yo para hablar de esas cosas porque no soy ninguna experta eso si me voy a centrar en la historia en si en las escenas en las cosas que he leido porque hay muchas cosas que decir que estan mal y lo siento pero no puedo aguantarme 
 aviso: no me voy a cortar un pelo esto esta lleno de spoilers 
 para empezar no solo creo que falta trabajar los personajes sino que habria que haberse documentado un poco en cuanto a las enfermedades que tratan y lo que suponen tanto para los que las sufren como para los de su alrededor entiendo que en una historia hacen falta dramas en los que apoyarse (hola soy yo todas mis historias tienen drama por alguna parte y ademas del intenso) pero es que en este libro podrias quitar tranquilamente lo del padre lo de la hermana y lo de la madre de eric y el resto permaneceria intacto emma seguiria siendo la misma y la parte que para las autoras es claramente la mas importante de su libro (el avance como bloguera de emma y la relacion con eric) no se alteraria si te quieres apoyar en eso por lo menos hazlo bien os juro que me ha parecido que ni las autoras tenian claro lo que le pasaba al padre en plan si bueno no se puede banar solo ni leer ni hablar pero ya y lo de la anorexia que se cura milagrosamente despues de que una nina de nueve anos (que entiende perfectamente lo que es la anorexia claro porque si no es algo dificilisimo de entender para algunos adultos no lo va a ser para alguien de esa edad) llore junto a la cama de la hermana pidiendole que por favor vuelva en fin me callo el caso es que estas hablando de cosas muy serias y tienen que tener una repercusion clara en la personalidad de la hija/hermana que ha tenido que vivir con las secuelas de aquello la tiene no emma se comporta con su padre como si fuera un senor extrano a quien le han encargado cuidar y claramente se la suda que su hermana tuviera anorexia porque la saluda con un <<has adelgazado>> y se queda tan ancha 
 se ve que emma es una persona comprensiva y entregada eh es una luchadora y responsable y ""una empollona"" o a lo mejor eso ultimo tampoco tanto porque esta en 2o de bach y a) se salta clases para estar con el malote de turno b) se pasa horas leyendo libros (muchos muchos libros y te los dice todos) en vez de estudiar c) pasa tardes enteras viendo videos de yt porque no debe tener nada mas que hacer uhm no hace tanto que hice 2o de bach y no tenia tiempo ni para mear tendria que haberme contado su secreto 
 pero espera que emma saca notazas en la pau despues de haber estado tocandose el papo todo el curso saliendo con moteros y liandose con booktubers olvidad el parrafo anterior no he dicho nada chicas dejad los estudios por un tio y otras distracciones que total la selectividad es muy poco importante y puedes sacar notazas estudiando dos dias antes 
 por otra parte esta la relacion de eric y emma o mejor decir instalove termino que he leido hace poco por ahi y me ha encantado no tiene sentido ninguno para empezar todos sus primeros encuentros son en plan mal (el de la biblioteca el de la innecesaria clase de literatura el de la fiesta a lo americano) se ha hablado ya de la escena de la hierba y que el la toquetea sin su permiso y cuando el poli le pregunta si hay algun problema ella dice que no que todo esta bien pero aun asi quiero hablar de ella; soy la unica a la que si se le acerca un desconocido le apartaria de un empujon preguntandole que cono hace en serio pensadlo literalmente le acabas de ver hace cinco minutos me la suda que sea guapo es que es acoso joder y te esta toqueteando casi besando que me estas contando tio 
 ah por cierto la tia le encuentra la hierba y se cabrea con ella pero cuando la hermana le cuenta que ""el poeta"" es guapo se le pasa se le pasa porque es guapo 
 en fin el caso es que sus primeros encuentros son en ese plan y despues el desaparece entre septiembre y abril () y al parecer la vida de emma y su familia no es lo suficientemente interesante sin eric pululando por ahi como para hablar de ella el vuelve de repente emma esta preocupadisima por el porque debe ser que en sus primeros encuentros fue amabilisimo con ella y le recuerda con carino (pista: en realidad es que es muy guapo) y va a hablar con el pasan cosas en las que los dos estan en su linea de antes el la besa asi porque why not y ya esta enamorada da igual todo lo que ha pasado porque como le dice un amigo de eric a emma <<si se comporta asi contigo es porque en el fondo le importas>> (hello it's me your old friend feminismo knocking at the door) mira no lo siento pero no aunque da igual el sigue siendo borde con ella emma le cuenta el accidente de sus padres out of nothing (juro que estaban hablando de otra cosa y de repente ella se lo suelta asi sin mas wtf) y en algun momento que debi perderme lo suyo se hace oficial pero el caso es que pasa tralala 
 oh y luego esta la primera vez que lo hacen la primera vez de emma es sin proteccion o sea si ella le coge un condon a la tia pero no se dice que ella lo saque ni que el se lo ponga ni nada porque oh ella se emociona demasiado y se calienta y en fin la pasion del guapo de eric ella le ha visto estar con varias chicas chicas con las que esta casi segura que eric ha hecho cosas mas alla que morrearse y aun asi decide que su primera vez con el va a ser sin proteccion porque debe ser que las ets son un mito bye 
 dos dias despues cortan ni siquiera discuten nada ella deja de hablarle y hale justo para que emma pueda conocer a su booktuber mexicano favorito por cierto tambien de personalidad poco consistente (creo que es el tipo de chicos que le gustan a emma visto su historial) y salido directamente de una telenovela guey el chaval se hace mazo amigo suyo en una noche y al dia siguiente le dice ""venga que como me conozco madrid te acompano a esa estacion que esta a tomar por culo"" y como todos los hombres que se ha cruzado emma ultimamente la besa sin consentimiento como dice mi amiga jasmina libres domingos y domingas sinceramente no entiendo por que se sigue romantizando tanto esto no me entra en la cabeza no es algo bonito es incomodo y agresivo las chicas adolescentes no deberian estar esperando eso por que no puede empezar a verse mas normal un <<puedo besarte>> <<si>> yo he vivido eso y tio es mucho mas bonito se te ponen mariposas en el estomago y la anticipacion y todas esas cosas que dice que siente emma por no hablar de cuando ella empieza a tener dudas sobre eric y cada vez que gabriel la besa (y lo otro) se siente superincomoda lo dice pero no se aparta pf que por cierto sobre el triangulo amoroso sin comentarios otra cosa que se fuerza para poner ""trabas"" en la relacion de ellos dos; aparece porque si y desaparece porque si y ya esta todo bien 
 detalles como que las puertas de los hospitales tiene una ventana para que veas al paciente (again en que hospital de madrid por favor) que una adolescente vaya al videoclub (no tienes netflix hija mia) o lo de que al principio de curso monten una fiesta con dj en el gimnasio del instituto (me pregunto si los vasos eran rojos y si habia ponche) son cosas que si se hubieran solucionado a tiempo le habrian dado menos aspecto de fanfic-de-wattpad son fallos de ambientacion de primero de escritura no se y luego lo de la blc y los libros que lee emma dios tenia que haberme informado de a cuanto estaba la mencion que lo haga una vez hace gracia un par vale pero todo el rato venga ya 
 y ya por ultimo: el gran misterio lo que hace que eric sea un chico malo lo de que condujo borracho y tuvo un accidente en el que se mato su novia cuando emma le dice <<no es tu culpa>> os juro que me he puesto a gritar como que no es su culpa si se emborracho y cogio la moto y tuvo un accidente que la mato que me estas contando os juro que no me lo creo lo leia y me parecia imposible que alguien pudiera disculpar a alguien asi sobre todo despues de que emma repita una y otra vez que eric es el tipo de persona que mato a su madre no tiene puto sentido que me estas contando 
 en fin no hay mucho mas que decir lo he leido como ya he dicho porque queria tener mi propia opinion y aqui esta siento si el tono que he usado ha ofendido a alguien pero dentro de lo que cabe todo lo que digo me parece serio fallos importantes si tanto hablamos de feminismo historias toxicas topicos y etc tal vez deberiamos tener en cuenta ciertos puntos antes de sacar algunas cosas al mercado que luego mucho criticamos otras novelas pero la nuestra no vamos a ser coherentes por favor y a revisar y aprender de los errores a ver si va a ser que el emperador si que esta desnudo no 
 pd: ninguna profesora de literatura de instituto te va a decir que lo que lees es una mierda ni que la literatura juvenil es para ninos para empezar es una profesora y sabe que es la literatura juvenil aunque creas que no lo sabe no ha nacido ayer segundo entiende el termino juvenil a la perfeccion porque da clase a gente de 16-18 anos si te manda leer la celestina es por otra cosa no porque sea el unico libro que conoce y para acabar es una profesora de literatura le gusta que leas le gusta que te guste leer no te va a decir que no lo hagas en serio que no **down shift is as a complete standalone novel**

 omfg may is seriously too far away right now and i need book two right now i highlighted about 90% of this book and it was virtually impossible for me to decide on which quotes to use because the entire book was freaking quotable 
 i fell in love with kl kreig's writing when i read black swan affair the writing was smooth beautiful eloquent poignant and evocative and part of me felt that that 5-star read was some sort of fluke well that theory was quickly quashed when i got lost in the story of lost in between 
 it didn't take long for me to become absorbed by the chemistry and connection between shaw and willow they were both commitment-phobes but the electricity that buzzed between them strongly tested their resistance what started as a business arrangement soon turned into something deeply personal and intimate there was only so long that these two could deny themselves what they instinctively wanted: each other 
 fair warning readers: this story is not only heartwarming and profound it's a freaking panty scorcher although this tale was sweetly romantic with contemporary flair the sizzling scenes between shaw and willow were hot enough to tantalize even my erotic sensibilities so freaking hot

 would i recommend this series: yes 
 would i re-read this series: maybe later 
 would i read future books by this author: yes 
 arc provided to me by author laurelin paige in exchange for an honest review okay with roughly 100 pages to go i think i've read enough i just couldn't finish this book and find myself very disappointed that ms day created her own story based on the wildly popular el james book ""fifty shades of grey"" sure christian grey is now ""gideon cross"" (i'm not a rocket scientist but i figured out the initial exhange - along with changing ""ana"" to ""eva"") but here's where i'm baffled: ms day is actually a good writer there's a reason i read as many pages as i did because of that fact with each turn of the page my heart sank for her 
 without going into the meat of this story if you've read fsog you essentially already know it yes the people places and situations have been jumbled around a bit but for the most part; (and it pains me to say it since this story had such great potential) someone should have waved a red flag in day's direction long before it was published 
 this is the first review where i am at a loss for words warning: this review contains a discussion of the c-word and i plan to use it please don't read this if you do not want to see the word spelled out thanks 
 this is less a review than an homage to my crazy mother (now i have you really intrigued don't i) 
 it was 1983 and i was in my first catholic school i'd spent my first six years of school in a public school but my ""behavioral issues"" coupled with my lack of growth made me a target for bullies so my parents were advised to move me to another school where no one knew me 
 so off i went to the home room of a fallen nun who'd given up her habit for a family she wasn't much of a teacher she was an old school catholic educator who practiced punitive teaching which included kicks to the shins yanking of ears pulling of hair and screaming from close range 
 i kept my head down and tried to blend in with my new surroundings but my mother made that difficult from the get go i was a voracious reader and she passed on the disease to me from grade two on she had been recommending great books to me i was reading everything before most everyone else but my mom's recommendation of lady chatterly's lover in my first month of catholic school was probably her most outrageous and unforgettable recommendation 
 she bought me a copy at the book store in the mall and that's where i met one of my favourite words of all time -- cunt 
 back in 1983 cunt was not a word in your average child's vocabulary sure we'd heard it and maybe even seen it but it was not something that was regularly used by kids and its usage was pretty vague to every 13 year old i knew 
 but there it was in lady chatterly's lover it was all over the place so as i read the story and absorbed the way lawrence used cunt his usage became my usage lawrence used cunt beautifully; it was not a term of denigration; it was not used to belittle; it was not an insult nor something to be ashamed of; cunt was lyrical romantic caring intimate and i came to believe that cunt was meant to be used in all these ways that the poetic use of cunt was the accepted use of cunt the correct use of cunt and suddenly cunt was part of my vocabulary 
 i was thirteen 
 now i didn't just start running around using cunt at every opportunity i did what i always did with new words that i came to know and love i added them to my vocabulary and used them when i thought it was appropriate 
 and when i whispered it to tammy the girl i had a crush on a few weeks later thinking that it was the sort of romantic poetic language that made women fall in love with their men (i can't remember what i said with it but i know it was something very much like what mellors would have said to constance) she turned around with a deep blush a raised eyebrow and a ""that's disgusting"" that rang through the class (i can still see the red of autumn leaves that colored her perfectly alabaster skin under a shock of curly black hair aaaahtammy apparently she had a better sense of cunt's societal taboos than i did) mrs c--- was on her feet and standing parallel to the two of us in a second demanding to know what was going on 
 to her credit tammy tried to save me -- sort of she said ""nothing"" then mrs c--- turned on me; i was completely mortified (i'd obviously blown it with the first girl i loved in junior high school) and while i was in this shrinking state mrs c--- demanded to know what was happening and what i had said 
 i tried to avoid repeating what i had said i admitted i shouldn't have been talking i admitted that i should have been working i tried to divert her attention but she was a scary lady and i couldn't help myself i repeated what i had said -- as quietly as i could -- but as soon as mrs c--- heard ""cunt"" i was finished that was the moment i knew ""cunt"" was the catalyst for the whole debacle 
 nowi'd known before that the word was taboo but i didn't think it would generate the response it did i really thought that tammy would be flattered and i certainly didn't expect that i would be dragged to the office by an angry ex-nun silly me 
 i got the strap it was the first time (although there would be another) three lashes to the palm of the hand 
 i didn't use ""cunt"" in public or private for a long time after that but my punishment couldn't diminish my love for the word lawrence made such and impression on my young mind that neither humiliation nor physical pain could overcome my appreciation of cunt's poetic qualities 
 to me the word is and always will be a beautiful and yes gentle thing 
 every time that event was recounted at the dinner table over the years whether it was amongst family or with my girlfriends or my future wife my mom always got this sly little grin on her face and indulged in a mischievous giggle before refusing to take the blame for me getting the strap after all ""who was the one who was stupid enough to use the word brad not me"" 
 i love her response as much as i love the word 
 and in case you were wondering my mom never stopped recommending books to me she was an absolute kook i miss her 
 i can't wait to pass on lady chatterly's lover to my kidsbut i think it's going to have to be in grade three if it's going to have the same effect it had on mehmmmi wonder how that will go over girl online on tour was a definite improvement compared to the previous novel i don't like noah but i do really appreciate all the important themes penny talks about in this book such as anxiety and standing up for yourself although very predictable it wasn't a bad read (just not the best) warning: i've been drinking 
 *hiccup* 
 you know- 
 *gestures with wine glass* 
 *sloshes some over the side* 
 i mean this book- 
 *licks wine off fingers* 
 *tries to refocus* 
 what was i saying oh yeah this fucking book man 
 *takes another sip* 
 there's damen a prince betrayed by his bastard of a brother sold into slavery to an enemy nation 
 *stumbles up to standing* 
 and do you know what you know who he's fucking sold to 
 *raises voice* 
 to an even bigger bastard than his brother 
 *sits back down* 
 a prince named laurent who may or may not be the best written ""villain"" i've ever read he's as beautiful as he is brilliant as manipulative as he is sadistic as enigmatic as 
 *hiccup* 
 i hate his face i want to do terrible things to him dirty lascivious debauched terrible terrible things 
 *wanders off in search of appropriate meme* 
 ah-ha found one 
 the world surrounding these characters is just as harsh brutal seductive violent depraved i want to write myself into it with a sword and carve my vengeance from the flesh of damen and - god help me - even laurent's enemies 
 *brews pot of strong coffee* 
 *hiccup* 
 *starts second book*

 https://wwwyoutubecom/watchv=ssib8 am i the only one creeped the fuck out he talks like this penis is a separate living entity 
 music to my dick the fuck 
 lol k 
 see more from buzzfeed here 
 edited to add again: just like midnight sun the manuscript for this one was stolen a week before release and is feared to have been sold to the highest bidder in the black market if it was really stolen that was unfortunate as much as i loathe the series that's a douchebag move however i'll rip the book a new one if i find out this was only noise/marketing to hype the book even more 
 edited to add: apparently so many pre-ordered this it's already a bestseller before it's even published humanity why 
 a remake of fifty shades from christian grey's perspective 
 who the fuck needs that weren't the three books enough for god's sake and seriously doesn't the author have any other ideas to write than the same story 
 just imagine: 
 the same sex scenes 
 just with more emphasis on his throbbing member 
 i really could've gone on with my life peacefully without knowing we'll be ""graced"" by this same story again at this point i see it nothing more as a cash cow edit 11/22/14 
 ""whatever our souls are made of his and mine are the same"" 
 this appears as a quote from after 
 this appears as a quote from after 
 i can't even i just can't even my fuck-o-meter exploded with this emily bronte would be choking herself to death if she were alive 
 so really to those who believe this book is well written and todd has a way with words better to know this lovely quote belongs to wuthering heights 
 * * * * * * * 
 you know what 
 fuck this 
 fuck the industry fuck the media fuck everything that promotes abusive behaviour as something romantic and appealing as something women have to put up with in the name of love as something women deserve as something women must strive for 
 as a woman as a person this makes me sick in so many levels especially due the fact that nowadays most teens believe such behaviour is okay after reading so many books that romanticize manipulative abusing bastards this definitely needs to stop for once 
 and what about the mediocre writing the fact that there's no plot whatsoever apart from an abusive relationship and make up sex is this the literature we want is this the literature that will survive the legacy we'll leave to future generations as a future editor this disgusts me it annoys me and it also saddens me because i can't understand why things like this are being published you can still make money by selling quality books but apparently quality doesn't matter anymore and some readers do not care about it either as it seems by now which saddens me even more congratulations-winner of best romance 2017 
 there is always a great deal of pressure when reviewing a highly anticipated novel before itaeur(tm)s release date when this magical arc was delivered to my doorstep and i read the press release i knew this would be a really special read i cleared my entire tbr schedule to be able to read this book immediately and i regret nothing if you are the type who likes to go into a book fully blind iaeur(tm)m going to stop right here and encourage that you to wait until you get your hands on without merit before reading any further or reading any reviews for that matter do you see how short the blurb above is itaeur(tm)s basically one line and thereaeur(tm)s good reason for that iaeur(tm)m also going to discuss minor spoilers of it ends with us as well as talk about some vague themes included in this current book just as a fair warning 
 now that iaeur(tm)ve gone through the fine print letaeur(tm)s start from the beginning iaeur(tm)m hoping to refer more to my experience while reading this book and what i learned from it than the actual plot itself as i feel this will better direct the right reader to this particular story anyone who devoured it ends with us last year knows that hoover isnaeur(tm)t shy in dealing with tough subjects and trigger worthy issues (one of the many things i love about the woman) and i was blown away with the fictional tale shrouded in her personal family history to bring awareness to domestic violence and what can happen when the continuous cycle is broken iaeur(tm)m not crying; youaeur(tm)re crying when everyone went bananas over that book last year it made me pause and ponder if perhaps coho is moving her stories slowly in a different direction sure enough i quickly discovered that without merit is unlike any book sheaeur(tm)s written thus far; if i had to compare it to another book of hers iaeur(tm)d say itaeur(tm)s most like iewu except much less romantic in fact iaeur(tm)d go as far as saying that wm isnaeur(tm)t actually a romance gasp does it contain romance in the novel sure but itaeur(tm)s more of a side plot and it most definitely isnaeur(tm)t the focal point of the story as you can guess this was a risky move for the author in veering so far from her normal writing style but iaeur(tm)m pleased to admit that it worked well so well this new direction is something i feel will keep hoover fresh unique and in demand for many years to come 
 when i began reading i noticed the differences almost immediately i love how there are little twists and surprises in all of cohoaeur(tm)s books but the ones found in wm are far deeper and more complex than those tied to her more traditional romance style the first 50 pages or so in the book is a major info dump; i was wondering where the authoraeur(tm)s signature dry humor was and felt the build up of a more serious tone which i think was necessary to prepare the reader for where she takes the rest of the story once i hit that mark the story really took off and i read the remainder in a single sitting i found i couldnaeur(tm)t tear myself away from the quirky sad bunch of characters who managed to still make me feel hopeful that things would turn around for them hoover has brought together a cast that shows what it truly means to be human; the vulnerability of each and every one of us is felt through these realistic people and i think that is one of colleenaeur(tm)s major talents which results in bringing repeat readers to her new books 
 while hoover chose to tackle domestic abuse and the horrific trauma involved surrounding the subject in her previous novel here she has chosen to bring awareness to mental health depression and suicide among many other things <aeur"" trigger warnings clearly listed while you may think this sounds like a dreary heavy read and youaeur(tm)d be partially correct the author never allows the light of hope to dim you may feel like this story seems crazy wild and unrealistic within the first 50% of reading it but if you reach the ending youaeur(tm)ll see it all makes sense and portrays a very timely important message i truly felt this was cohoaeur(tm)s most appropriate book for a younger audience not only because the usual steamy sexy romance is traded for a milder coming of age and discovery but because the message is just so dang important for our older teens and college aged students to hear cue the feels 
 i know iaeur(tm)m rambling and iaeur(tm)m truly sorry for that but this is a ramble worthy book iaeur(tm)ve already heard some people speculating that they are worried theyaeur(tm)ll be disappointed in this dramatic change of style and genre for a beloved author; let me be the first to tell you you have nothing to worry about holy guacamole this book is amazing i canaeur(tm)t remember a single book since iewu that has caused me to take a step back and think about tough things for quite some time i also think itaeur(tm)s truly appropriate that my 1000th book logged as read on goodreads was such an important one as this without merit is a book that is worthy of your time and money; donaeur(tm)t sit in a queue of 200 people waiting for it to come in at the library buy it pre-order it add it to your tbr on goodreads talk about it with your friends; i promise ladies and gentlemen this one is worth the hype as a mother of two young girls i took away so much from this book; it made me toss around scenarios and ideas of how i might react in a similar situation and what i need to do to be as involved accepting and loving toward my children as i can possibly be clasp your pearls to your chest and grab a hanky; this one is a tear jerker but per classic hoover there is a ray of hope that turns into what a real happily ever after should look like ps-that classic wit and humor does make many an appearance i was just pulling your leg gy~%0

 ********************* 
 i don't even know what to say to do this book justice what are words how do i talk about this book sans spoilers how can coho write books like this and not personally hold my hand while reading them gy~ hands down my favorite jenny han book ever this was the perfect conclusion and it filled me with joy and warmth and nostalgia i'm so in love with this book 
 ~05/2016~ 
 50% of me is excited bc more lara jean and peter 
 50% of me is dreading john (yea i'm not a fan) warning: ragey rant against slut-shaming ahead 
 ""what about frankie i can't do this to her i shouldn't have kissed you i'm not that girl who--"" 
 bitch please you are 
 this story is ya contemporary fluff about teenagers who make bad decisions i'm not against this book because of the fact that the teens made bad decisions i was a teenager once i've made my share of idiotic choices about which i cringe upon reflection i'm against this book because of: 
 1 incredibly bad decisions yes there is a difference between 19-year old me driving 80 miles to meet a (female) online friend (accompanied by my real life friend for safety) vs 17 year old girls driving over 300 miles to las vegas to get drunk and then split to party with strange boys i'm not trying to victim blame i'm trying to beg the use of some common sense 
 2 the cheating 
 3 the slut-shaming 
 first the good diversity it's awesome that the characters are diverse hannah is korean her best friend lo is mexican awesome but people diversity doesn't make up for everything that's wrong with this book 
 the plot: good-girl hannah decides to sneak away to vegas to meet her online best friend nick warning spoilery stuff ahead if you should care to read this book 
 *takes a deep breath* 
 turns out online-friend nick has a girlfriend said girlfriend has big boobs and looks flashy therefore she barely counts as a human being therefore it's perfectly acceptable for nick to cheat on her to make mooney eyes at hannah and for hannah to return the favor and fall in love with nick because his gf totally doesn't count right 
 wrong bloody fucking wrong 
 this is a story about hannah therefore she is the good girl she is not if this story were told in frankie (nick's gf)'s perspective it would be a whole different tale one of how nick fucking cheated on her with a girl he knew online yeah how do you like them apples it takes two to tango and nick is taken the fact that hannah wants him and feels and is portrayed as more worthy doesn't change the fact that they cheated 
 cheating is not forgiveable but can be more sympathetically portrayed if there is remorse if the person knows what they did was wrong if they felt like the scum of the earth etc i might have some sympathy for them there is none such in this book 
 now the slut shaming just because a girl has big boobs doesn't mean she's a bitch doesn't mean she's a slut my fucking god are we in the victorian age here desire is not a sin having an enviable body is not a crime just because a girl is beautiful and sexually attractive does not make her a slut why do authors continue to perpetrate these harmful stereotypes 
 hannah is so fucking resentful against frankie for her big boobs she repeats this hateful tirade throughout the book and i was sick of it listen to these examples 
 and then a girl walks out from backstage a tiny girl with red hair not ginger red but red like a crayon dyed herself probably in some sink or bathtub like grace this morning tight jeans a loose t-shirt--but not so loose that you can't see her huge boobs--she looks the part of hipster or groupie or oh i'm with the band girl 
 ""that's his girlfriend the chick with the red hair and the huge boobs"" 
 i don't need to have this girlfriend conversation with nick in person and certainly not with her standing right next to us big boobs all in my face 
 i don't want to like her i want to punch her in the face i want to make her disappear so i never have to look at her funky style and big ol' boobs ever again 
 i could never pull off those shoes and that dress in public where did she get those boobs 
 frankie to me was not a bitch she is a perfectly nice girl she is extroverted she is eager she is affectionate towards everyone - even hannah herself but because she is inconveniently the object of nick's affection she is portrayed as the bad girl because she has large breasts she is portrayed as the bad girl that's not ok with me i had attempted to read this book a couple of weeks ago but i wasn't feeling it and gave up after 40 pages man am i happy that i gave it a second chance this was so dang cute and surprisingly not cheesy despite the plot sounding like a total cheese-fest i love how this wasn't just an adorable slow-building romance but it also follows lincoln and his difficulties with growing up and moving on definitely read this if you are a fan of rainbow rowell's other novels or romantic comedies the most perfect ending to the most beautiful love story on planet earth best epilogue ever ever 
 whenever i read a melanie harlow book i have an overwhelming desire to stalk handsome men on instagram it happened with dima of course and the lovely brandyn and who can forget franggy but theo macleod i had to find my own inspiration for him and i found a good one yann wellhauser - you can thank me later for the eye candy 
 aside from stalking handsome men melanie forces me to buy bras and knickers to match covers i was saved from that particular buying spree but damn i need the yummy goodness of cinnamony sugary marshmallow deliciousness that theo and claire cook if yann can come and suck my fingers that would be just perfect i'll even suck his 
 now the book claire hires theo to be her date at a wedding does it end there hell no sexy times red lipstick banging in the kitchen snowy cabins and fairytales i floved it madoc and fallon got their happily ever after 
 so did jax and juliet 
 this is jared and tate's

 my emotions were engulfed by this beautiful yet broken book feels flowing all over the pages chills ran through me my breaths were bated my pulse raced my heart shattered i felt every word i read after we fall was my adrenalinemy anguishmy achemy addiction i was all in

 ""i'd already met the love of my lifei'd married her and i'd lost herthere was no second chance"" 
 i wanted to wrap up jack in a huge hug my heart bled for this cowboy who suffered a great loss and is still stuck in the darkness the closed-off alpha reveals a peek of his big heart and margot can't help but become enamored by this complex cowboy 
 ""someone who loved like that had to have a big heart even if it was buried beneath prickly layers of grief and bitterness i'd give him another chance"" 
 margot is smart funny and beautiful inside and outi loved her the sweet and sassy woman wants to get to know the gorgeous annoying and tender-hearted man who gets under her skin 
 jack wants to ignore the first woman since his late wife to invade his head and heat his body that's been in hibernation for three years but the magnetic force between margot and him is too powerful to ignore 
 ""i knew what i was going to do before i did it i knew it was a bad idea i knew i'd regret it and i still did iti kissed herour tongues met and i tasted her hungrily like i'd never get enoughsweet and forbidden"" 
 the chemistry burns bright between margot and jack a forbidden flame that fights to ignite so hard to resist oh did i love their angst that bled all over the pages 
 ""he was kissing me like i'd never been kissed before like he was going to war""

 'hard not to fall' stars 45/5 
 i really enjoyed this especially the last 1/3 of the book it had a unique premise a great main character a nice romance and a great message i recommend to all of you looking for a good quick read whether you are usually a fan of ya romance or not you just can't beat the person who never gives up ~babe ruth 
 sitting in the stands watching your favorite baseball team play is a high that dives off the diamond straight to you as the energy engulfs the air the fans are engaged and intently watching the players with baseball greats in tight pants an added bonus adrenaline courses through your veins as you hope your team wins you can't help but feel alive the player by k bromberg made me feel alive with its energy and emotion pulse-pounding and passionate the player penetrates the heart like a fastball soaring straight to the soul 
 when your heart is still racing and your pulse is pounding after you finish a book it's the highest of highsthe best feeling ever i rode the highest of highs with the player this story sparked to life and oh did i feel every flameevery tremorevery wordeverything easton and scout together were everything the player was everything 
 the player held my heart soon after i turned the first page never letting goi never let go this baseball book instantly catapulted itself into my heart and mind with a force i was powerless to stop the player assaulted me its angst was my adrenaline and ache; its pendulum of fire and ice was my passion; and its power was my power too this soul-searing story struck me like a fast ball fast and furiously the player was all fired up and ready to ignite all of the feels where i could not help but feel every one 
 the player -- so powerful and passionate --possessed me i could not devour this heart-stopping sexy and strong story fast enough the baseball meets romance plot is powerful easton and scout are combustible together -- so raw and real -- and bromberg's writing is off-the-charts incredible flowing with a heady mix of feels and fire my feels were on fire engulfed in emotions that were flames blazing with a dual dose of heady heat and heart 
 the dedication made me smile 
 the dedication is as powerful and poignant as the book 
 the dedication is personal a glimpse into the real woman behind the authornot k bromberg but kristy 
 the dedication is everything 
 not even ten percent in and this story was already 5 stars instant love k bromberg quickly hit this baseball book out of the park and the game had barely begun i knew that being a sports romance addict the player would be a huge hit but i did not expect my heart to be hit the hardest i did not expect to need the player so very much this raw and riveting romance was my oxygen to breathe as i needed the player pure power and passion in words 
 easton wylder is a baseball god a legend on and off the field smokin' hot a player with a heart of gold a super star who has to defy the odds of playing baseball again after a big injury 
 scout dalton is beautiful brave and bold a female in a man's world of baseball a ball-buster in a ball game-focused world a healer as a physical therapist who has to live up to a legend 
 scout is partnered with easton her new patient fire and ice open and closed hero and heroine 
 ""if you're going to bust my chops wilder you should know that i can give as good as i get"" 
 like the rest of k bromberg's heroines scout is strength in spades with quick wit i loved this sassy spitfire of a heroine scout batted virtual balls with the player a battle of banter that was charged with electricityso enticing and entertaining words were fire burning through the pages 
 ""i'm a hard girl to please"" 
 patient blends with player 
 ""a demanding woman indeed"" he murmurs before giving me that tender type of kiss that reverberates to your toes and then all the way back up until it slams into your belly 
 lines are blurredmaybe crossed 
 oh the heat that smolders from this story 
 ""good thing i've got a big bat and know how to use it"" 
 there may be no going back now 
 ""i think i got to you i think when you close your eyes you think about me i think you don't want to but you do because god knows i think about you scout"" 
 the push and pull of the player was the sweetest ache 
 i swooned as easton's words melted me like molten lava easton and scout have combustible chemistry paired with passion that's difficult to ignorea fight neither will win the push and pull the fire and ice one or both may crash and burn this game may end in a shut-out where only one player comes out on top 
 this baseball romance has heartall of the heart the player touched my heart so many times that i lost countthe passion bled through the pages each word a drop that oozed to life tears fell hard and fast like baseballs as these characters' pain became mine i felt every word penetrate through me pounding every emotion: smiles swoon and tearsi felt it all 
 the player hits hard like a fast ball feels soaring all of the way across the bases k bromberg takes you on the diamond in the locker room so close to this baseball game that you're part of this baseball team too you can't help but surrender to this sports story--baseball meets romance--as emotions entangle around every word like a mitt to a baseball 
 there is one constant in k bromberg's books: live life to the fullest take a chancea risk make every moment matter this book and all of k bromberg's other masterpieces matter 
 i went into the player expecting a sizzling sports romance with a few feels what i received was all of the feels and so much more the player is perseverance the player is power the player is passion the player is a punch to the heart the player is k bromberg's poignant words wrapped around a baseball story woven in love the player is pure perfection the player has all of the sparkall of heartall of the soul all of my heart all of my soul 
 k bromberg brought her a-game out to play in the player a grand-slam of a baseball romance that hits the heart and slays the soul i loved the player so much a 2017 super star the player is the best baseball romance i've ever met a must-read romance this baseball-meets-romance book--an ace--is in the big leagues i'm not ready for this game to be over 
 ""i've played on grass my whole life scout there's no need for me to see what's out there when it's green beneath my feet""

 a calculating sinful and devious story that erotically blends lust romance desire and revenge into one palpable addictive read skye warren has masterfully crafted a story that begs readers to enter into a world where deception knowledge power and control is a must so are you ready to make your move and outsmart the pawn 
 ""as gabriel miller pointed out i have one thing left of value my body my virginity maybe the man outside wants that"" 
 it's no secret that i am a fan of skye warren and when she decided to write a story that dealt with a heroine auctioning off her virginity you gotta know that i will be all over this book and let me just say skye had me hooked i was a pawn in her masterfully orchestrated game of love survival and revenge 
 avery james is the princess who fell from the graces of the elite and privileged she once lived an enchanted fairytale life where she was spoiled by her father and had it all but that all came crumbling down when everything of value was gone penniless and no money to help pay for her father's medical expenses avery is forced to auction off the only thing that has value her virginity 
 ""you don't taste sweet"" he says pausing ""you taste like i'm fucking dying and you're the only water around you taste like goddamn air"" 
 so when gabriel miller bought avery james she became not only his possession for one month but he owned her in every sense of the word his command his touch his wants his needs his game and avery james was just the pawn in this calculated move of revenge and power 
 gabriel miller knew that avery james is an innocent virgin she was his for the taking and once he set his eyes on something he claims it as much as he is drawn to her she was a temptation that he must resist 
 avery's virginity is for the taking it is only a matter of when gabriel will claim it but what avery never expected was to be attracted to him she wants and needs him in such a primal manner but what happens when gabriel finally claims her virginity will avery find her lose her upper hand in this game of control in this game of knowing what move to make first will the pawn outwit the king 
 ""maybe i wouldn't feel so dirty if he'd just taken my virginity the first night regular sex right away even coming on me as sharp and intimate as it is i could have withstood it's the orgasms he forces from my body that feel like a violation"" 
 the pawn is hands down one of my favorite books that skye warren has written so far each action characters and prose were meticulously and flawlessly delivered to heighten the erotic chemistry between avery and gabriel i love that skye warren didn't hold anything back when it came to this calculating game of power control and lust she had readers on the edge as she drops a few twist and turns along the way and let me just say that ending has me wanting the next book stat so if you are looking for a book that was masterfully and erotically orchestrated then this dark romance is the book for you 
 skye warren well that was a jaw dropper 
 a fucking jaw dropper i'm still reeling ahhhhh okay i think i've found a new addiction and it's 
 royally 
 intoxicating you guys i started paper princess around 11pm on a sunday night my plan was to read until 12:30 yeah rightttttt 
 biggest mistake ever 
 i had to forced myself to set it down i had read and read and read and before i knew it i had to be up in 2hrs two hours the next morning i couldn't think not about anything but this book i was obsessed intoxicated completely taken by what i was reading as i was making my kids breakfast my mind ran a marathon covering every little detail and scene my mind had soaked in i couldn't get my kids to school fast enough i came home i finished immediately and oh my word seriously this friends is your next addiction these royal's are delightfully wicked in every single way 
 when you first meet callum royal and his sons you don't know what to think of them callum swoops in and saves the day literally i personally thought the man was fantastic even with his blatant flaws glaring at you i saw a diamond in the rough i have a major crush on him he's hawt but his boys oh baby his five sons left something to be desired to be honest at first they're a bunch of assholes gorgeous assholes but fuckers i wanted to throat punch nonetheless however first appearances are often times deceiving there's soooo many things going on in this story so many skeletons and little hidden compartments lingering behind the scenes just waiting to jump out i'm still trying to figure each of them out 
 one of best things about paper princess my most favorite thing is ella herself our main character is down right fabulous at 17 this girl has handled more than anyone should and it hasn't broken her no if anything it's made her one hell of a fighter i respected her i admired her she's lost her mother her father and she's had to do things to get by that made my heart ache this feisty yet sweet girl has been taking care of herself for what seems forever and because of that she's developed an incredibly fierce sense of independence she rarely shows weakness and if she feels weak she gets over it in the very next breath simply put 
 i have a girl crush on her 
 with ella's life's doing a 180--from pauper to princess--she's thrust into the royal mansion that could easily change her as a person yet it doesn't ella harper is a good to her core but while she's good she's also strong she takes no shit and gives zero fucks as well 
 [ ""i lift a finger and trail it slowly across his naked pecs my nail scraping across his smooth skin his breath hitches almost imperceptibly but itaeur(tm)s there 
 my heart leaps to my throat and blood begins to pound in places that i absolutely do not want to be associated with reed royal urg i don't know what to feel i'm happy and i liked it but at the same time i'm not happy and damn you john ambrose mcclaren for getting under my skin 
 i was so mad the way peter kept putting gene first lara jean had every right to break up with him staying friends with gene is one thing but hanging out with her like 24/7 is ridic then darn john comes in all charming and wonderful and then i start to want her with him then peter finally at the very end decides to fight for her and she forgives him and says it was her fault all along that she needed to get over her gene insecurities i wanted her with peter but peter never really apologized and why did he let her break up with him and then finally when he was jealous of john he started fighting for her it was all very maddening 
 omg thank goodness there is a sequel because dear peter was definitely not an ending except the author said there will be more about that other model un guy john and we will see his letter so thus probably another love triangle no just peter no john go away john 
 please finally have lara jean and peter end up together and josh can just be friends with everyone i don't think he should get back with margot after kissing her sister i absolutely loved when josh and peter were arguing about who would get their cookies and peter said that if lara jean made josh's white chocolate cranberry ones and not his fruitcake ones then it was over lol post script on may 8 2012 
 this book has exploded since i first read it and it seems to be one that is either loved or hated i'm actually very thankful that i read it before any of my gr friends or anyone i knew because i feel like if i read it now after hearing all the hype it would probably disappoint 
 people have very strong reactions to fifty shades and just to put in my two cents: you read different books for different reasons in my opinion : was this book a great piece of literature no were these characters ones whom you could write grad school theses about no but you know what i loved the romance i loved the chemistry and i enjoyed myself tremendously while reading it - it had me grinning ridiculously for hours that's what i wanted from this book and that's what i got so for me that was enough 
 post post script on october 9 2012 
 i greatly appreciate all those who have defended my review in the comments section - especially those who completely disagreed with my opinion of the book for those making hateful comments: you don't like the book people who did are apparently driving you crazy so my advice: stop reading all the positive reviews age-old rule: if you don't have anything nice to say don't say anything at all 
 post post post script on january 13 2017 
 almost 500 comments on this review but none for awhile so not sure why i'm coming back to it now i started reading the most recent comments though and my own review and frankly i wanted to delete some of it but figured that was ridiculous at this point i wouldn't write this same review were i to read it now but that was what i thought that morning at the time right after i read it so it is what it is finally watched the movie recently which is probably what brought me round to this and for the record: yes christian does f*cked up shit (they don't even get to all of it in the movie) and were this real-life i would have advised her to get a restraining order because wtf but it's not anyway i wrote what i wrote; i was in my early 20s; i liked it peace xo 
 sincerely juliana 
 * actual review begins here * 
 5+ stars 
 wow wow wow wow i still feel somewhat under the spell of this book i'm so  beguiled by it ;-) (book allusion) it was honestly an amazing read - and one which i meant to just skim a few sample pages of but ended up buying and then staying up the entire night to finish i wasn't even sure i wanted to write a review because it seemed too difficult to put into words everything that moved me about this story and to try to do it justice 
 this ended up feeling like one of the best and most authentic romances i have read in some ways i feel conflicted like anastasia when i say that: my instinct is to say that can't be because of what their relationship revolves around / how it's constructed  but somehow it can be and it's true anastasia christian and their relationship are all so honestly and openly written and shown to us that there is no other way for me to feel even though its counterintuitive i can't help but feel that their relationship is one of the most beautiful complex and emotional ones i've read in the romance genre 
 it's one of those books that makes me want to go back to the last few 4-5 star books i read and knock down their ratings half a star because when put on the same scale they don't compare i had a ridiculously foolish grin on my face throughout the entire thing both because i was on one of those this-romance-is-unbelievably-fantastic highs and the book had some surprisingly good humor i had a pleasant feeling of anticipation as i read but i was also extremely nervous because real bdsm sub/dom books are not my thing and so while i was falling increasingly in love with ana and christian with every new page i read i was also terrified that i was going to be jarringly yanked out of it all and the whole experience ruined for me by some kinky and needlessly over-the-top bdsm scene thankfully that never happened and it remained an amazing read right up until the very end 
 { not what i expected } 
 i'm not normally a bdsm book reader but this was so so so much more than just that i don't think that i have read one that is so beautifully and (seemingly) authentic i write seemingly because i have no personal experience so no idea but to me it read that way it was not done as a space apart in the book where the writer could insert random hot sex scenes instead it's woven throughout showing us how it impacts and affects both characters ana and christian remain ana and christian in those scenes in the sense that it doesn't feel like out-of-character gratuitous sex scenes are at every random turn just to satisfy some quota i'm not even sure i want to categorize this book as erotica because that seems so limiting (there was hot - intense - chemistry don't get me wrong and i definitely had some turn-the-ac-up moments) 
 { loved our heroine: anastasia / ana (21) } 
 anastasia was one of the best heroines because she felt so real and her reactions each and every time were so normal not over-the-top for effect but not understated because the author wants to be able to put lots of sex scenes she's a virgin has no experience with men and didn't know anything about bdsm so of course she's going to be questioning this and unsure of whether it's ""right"" or it's ""wrong"" or if she even feels comfortable doing it she also is very attracted - and eventually in love - with christian and wants to be in a relationship with him ana feels a connection to him that she has never felt with any other person and she wants him in her life; he makes her happy her attempts to balance these two forces is wonderfully depicted and i could easily imagine myself reacting in those exact same ways thinking those exact same things and feeling those exact same conflicts 
 ana is strong - she's somewhat shy and quiet but like all real people you cannot fit her into only one category: she may seem reserved and quiet but she can also stand up for herself and really knows her own mind - she is not the ideal sub christian first thinks she might be ana examines her motivations and feelings when she's confused or unsure - not only about what she should do but about what she wants to do and what christian wants from her the story is told in first-person which is sometimes iffy for me but it worked well here; ana's tone as narrator is smart self-aware and immensely likable 
 { adored our hero: christian (27) } 
 christian is one of the best heroes he's intense and dark and i know some people still see him as mysterious and the dark force in all this but i actually found him to be so accessible there are still things we need to know about his history obviously - i have some guesses but don't know anything for sure nonetheless he also felt like the most authentic bdsm dom i could ever read because he's not just that - he's a man who has that part of himself incorporated into his life personality and mannerisms so that it's integral to his character even when we see him around other characters who don't know about this part of his life 
 christian is possessive a little stalkerish domineering (no duh) authoritarian elusive mercurial - all of those things and more he is also one of the most tender tortured and sensitive heroes i've ever read his despair and his need for ana is his life are like living breathing things and they jump off the page he also has a deep understanding about himself and his desires though he discovers and faces new things through ana's questions and confrontations he needs to dominate and control his partner but he also needs ana so he is willing to compromise and not only tries to give her that ""more"" but ends up wanting it himself as well 
 { an unbelievable connection and relationship } 
 from the first page of their encounter the chemistry between anastasia and christian was off the charts it was one of the things that convinced me to buy the book after reading the sample - it was so intense their connection throughout feels so strong and despite the fact that they're coming from such different places you can see the constant back and forth of them trying to fit together trying to understand what the other wants what they themselves want etc the dialogue the emails the everything between them is 
 a m a z i n g 
  i had such a ridiculous grin on my face for most the entire book this goes back to my first point but i was just so amazed by how realistic their relationship seemed despite the bdsm sub/dom factor which to me seems so foreign it was complex difficult lovely distressing uplifting intense hopeful 
 { this book felt so honest } 
 and i mean this in multiple ways: the main characters their relationship and the subject matter reading this book feels like an intimate act because ana and christian are truly laid bare for us; yes there are still things about his past we don't know but who they are their essentials are revealed to us their relationship is so honest and i mean this in two ways: within the book and how the reader sees it within the book i so so loved that they both try to be open with one another about their feelings and their doubts that we see them trying to work through this relationship and feel each other out figure out what this is between them loved loved loved it also for the reader how their connection is shown both in terms of man-woman and sub/dom felt very very honest it wasn't porn-like or gratuitous or kinky for kink's sake - it was built off of who these two people are and how they connect with and need one another 
 { overall fantastic } 
 surprisingly funny and sweet fantastic secondary characters no evil guy or superfluous subplot - the obstacles are within themselves and their relationship and that is more than enough; anything else would have ruined the book and taken away from their story subtle but sizzling chemistry and sexual tension complex characters etc etc 
 { ending of the book / series } (no spoilers) 
 *important to know that ana and christian's story does not end here* 
 the ending is jarring though i had ruined it for myself by having already read the next book's summary ( 
 fifty shades darker 
  due out september 15) i think the buildup should definitely have been extended because it did feel pretty out of the blue to me 
 as little a thing as it is the fact that the end says ""end of part one"" and this isn't viewed as book 1 and the next as book 2 really made a difference to me gives more of a sense of continuity and makes this feel like an intermission i love where the book / series titles come from lol (christian's remark to ana that he's ""fifty shades of f*cked-up"") note: all together there will be three books 
 for those interested but unsure google has a relatively long sample section you can read to get a sense of whether you'll like the book or not: http://booksgooglecom/ebooksid=wr7

 i liked this book 
 i wish my husband owned a suit this book is so much better than tarryn fisher being naked in your hotel room spread eagle on the couch eating ice cream out of the tub 
 i don't like ice cream though so i'm not sure what that says about this book 
 i also don't like tarryn fisher 
 or hotel rooms 
 i like eagles but they're going extinct 
 but mud vein was good though right can i get an amen i was only three chapters in when i had this strong feeling that i would never forget this story 
 and now that i finished it i can confirm that this is one of the twenty most memorable love stories i have read 
 it took me close to twelve hours to finish this book but i don't regret any minute i spent reading this emotional story maybe i could have read two novels in that amount of time but the problem with forever touched my heart so deeply i'm sure i'll be rereading it again in a couple of years 
 it's magnificent the love story although wonderful and dream-worthy is not even the best thing about this book 
 mallory is the star her characterization is outstanding and her character development admirable the entire story is extremely well-written and convincing but mallory - also known as ''mouse'' - will make any reader feel for her 
 i couldn't stop thinking about her it's not even some type of girl crush she's the type of character so beautiful we're afraid to expose them to the world because we don't want them to be tainted we want to conserve them as pure as they initially are 
 i didn't want to stop reading this book because i didn't want to leave mallory she has so much to deal with i felt like by keeping on reading i was somehow there for her she actually unconsciously makes the readers feel like their presence alone can help her 
 it's incredible i rarely feel this way about characters 
 when we first start reading this book we may think that there will be insta-love or insta-lust but the author steers clear of those mallory and rider have a connection because they grew up together and have been there for one another for a long period of time but now as they're facing each other four years after being separated they want to reconnect to relearn everything about one another 
 it's so sweet since it deals with long-term effects of child neglect and abuse interested readers have to imagine there will be drama and tears and harrowing scenes 
 but in the end when i turned the last page and i looked back at my reading time i couldn't help but realize how fascinated by the story i was 
 it's not perfect but it's perfectly imperfect

 smashwords it's pride and prejudice for socialists will i ever give a jane austen book less than 5 stars doesn't look like it 
 this is the second time i've read this book and i enjoyed it even more than i did the first time mr tilney is still the most hilarious flirt and i love how catherine has a crush on him from the beginning as i found that far more relatable than the accidentally-falling-in-love trope that is in many of austen's other works i'm not exactly sure what made this reading experience so fantastic probably the fact that the faux-gothic style fit with halloween so much and that i was able to read it with the rest of the austentatious book club also as i am now more versed in her other works i was able to see how this (her first novel) showcased her early talents and inner reflections on whether novel writing was a worthy profession this book may not be for everyone but if you're looking for a lighthearted and relatively easy classic to read pick this up 
 [original review from june 2015] 
 i really enjoyed this i am obviously a huge fan of jane austen but i had heard so little about this novel that i was unsure of it going in it definitely isn't as perfect as pride and prejudice (nothing can be let's be honest) but i loved the parody of 18th century gothic novels and found myself laughing at loud several times mr tilney catherine and eleanor were the only characters i really enjoyed in this novel as everyone else seemed to be vain materialistic and/or annoying this both made me happy as i had people to root against and laugh at and unhappy as the annoying conversations with isabella and john got repetitive after a while still i had a surprisingly fun time reading this and i can't wait to watch the adaptation with jj feild as mr tilney (that beautiful grammar-loving flirt) and swoon <3 arc provided by author in exchange for an honest review 
 there is no faking or pretending about it ilsa madden-mills has the magical touch when it comes to writing love stories with heat passion and most importantly heart with her vivid and sexy prose ilsa allows her readers to easily fall for her charismatic and lovable characters and in the fake fiancee this statement couldn't be more true as readers like myself are sucked into a vortex where we are consumed with an addictive sweet and palpable love story as two worlds collide on and off the field 
 ""it wasn't about the pretending i could be a fake girlfriend it was my body that was the problem i wanted max kent"" 
 max kent is the star and face of leland university as one of the top contenders to win the heisman trophy max's presence is known on and off the field there are no shortage of football groupies who are willing to be a notch on his goal post so when a feisty neighbor moves in next door max is automatically intrigued with sunny and her sassy and vibrant personality 
 as it turns out sunny and max shares a class together so naturally max offers her a ride to class when they appeared in class walking together automatically everyone begins to stare and wonder who max kent is walking with when max suggest that sunny be his pretend girlfriend to keep his ex and groupies at bay sunny doesn't think too much of it since max and her have this natural friendship and connection 
 ""time and time again i was taken aback by his off-the-charts hotness but it wasn't his looks that tugged at my heart not really it was him--his innate charm that made me want to strangle him one second and then hug him the next"" 
 well as it turns out it doesn't take long for sunny and max to realize that their friendship begins to get blurred fake kisses and touches begins to feel real innocent and playful text messages are no longer in the friends category so when sunny and max finally acts on their attraction what happens when fake becomes real 
 ""our kiss was pure  unadulterated magic making me powerless in his arms he was gut-twistingly perfect and i wanted to drown in him  i didn't need air all i needed was max kent and his lips and tongue"" 
 i absolutely adore this gem of a book ilsa madden-mills will definitely have readers swooning for max kent in the fake fiancee mills did an amazing job showcasing that max kent may be the star on the football field but he also is the golden boy with a heart of gold behind his rugged and sexy physique there is no faking about it that ilsa has definitely written book boyfriend and book husband material so if you are looking for a book that beautifully weaves humor sass raw emotions and hot chemistry then you better one-click this book now all i can say this book was a major touchdown in terms of the new adult genre 
 ilsa madden-mills laurelin paige my heart has been split open absolutely torn apart and the only thing that is holding it together is the promise of book #2 i've read some damn good duets in the past but my god this one takes the cake erotic to the core you've created something special and unique with these characters i've never wanted to throw my kindle against the wall more and yet i couldn't spare a single second turning my eyes away from the pages you've given us a special kind of asshole with dk he defines the term alpha male in every possible way ladies get ready for the men there will be one particular man who you are just going to love to hate and when i say hate i mean h a t e 
 ""how much do you want me to hurt you"" 
 he asked 
 god i almost came he knew knew that this was edgy that this brought up difficult memories but he knew i still wanted to play 
 ""do you want me to tell you to stop"" 
 i'd never tell him to stop i was sure i'd take whatever he wanted to give me 
 he lowered himself over me so that i could feel his erection hot and hard against my pelvis 
 ""i want you to beg me to stop"" 
 and ladies this isn't even the tip of the iceberg there is so much hotness in this book so much so that you will be reading certain scenes over and over again when laurelin paige gives us a seriesshe gives us a series scorching hot nsfw at all sex scenes emotion that runs deep through every single turn of the page page after page of swoon-worthy assholeryyep that's a thing look it up there wasn't a page i didn't absolutely devour there wasn't a chapter i didn't scream at this duetthese charactersthis storyline is everything i'm obsessed i'm addicted i'm over the top in love with everything about these dirty filthy rich men embrace your filthy fantasies and pick up this enticing and seductive romance now i feel like there is a deeper meaning behind fifty shades of grey then just bdsm and sex but the huge downfall of this book was the writing i can see both sides of the fifty shades argument there are points in the book where i can see abuse but there are also points where there is none 
 i just hate the fact that if people enjoy this book they are labeled as ""pro-rape advocates"" or ""pro-abuse"" stop it stop trying to belittle others everyone is entitled to their own opinion you may not agree but don't hate we are all readers here l 'kthr 'nq@ mn wrd@ l tthrthr kthyr

 lswr 'wdh mqttft b`dsty 45 waaaay better than that fifty shades of grey i do get the comparison but truly this is a much better read simply put this book had the polish that fsog grossly lacked (i read fsog just before i read this one sadly i found it disturbing and only gave it a 1-star review) 
 the major similarities: 
 --hero is a young (late 20's) gorgeous brilliant zillionaire business mogul who sports non-stop erections and has sex on the brain 24/7 
 --hero has a controlling and obsessive desire for the heroine including a jealous streak that is off-the-charts 
 --hero a has a dark and tortured soul that shapes his very world brought on by years of abuse as a child 
 --hero maintains a platonic relationship with his past sexual partners which drives a major wedge with the heroine 
 --hot hot hot sex scenes 
 the major differences: 
 -- gideon isn't a predator unlike grey gideon never tries to coerce and manipulate eva into doing anything that is for his sole pleasure alone he doesn't try to coerce and manipulate her into believing his desires should be the only desires that matter 
 --eva has about 100+ iq points on ana and can actually converse in an intelligent conversation without all of the ""whoa"" ""oh my"" and ""gasp"" (to say i like eva better than ana is an understatement) 
 --gideon isn't into 'period sex' yuck 
 --no bdsm at least not yet this series will continue so hard to say where it will go hmmmm there was some light talk of subs & doms pain-as-pleasureetc 
 --no arnica cream to sooth 'bruising sprains and injuries' (christian's remedy for a bruising sore ass oh lovely) 
 --the writing is great tight edited and well plotted it is also quite refreshing when compared to the comic book tone of fsog 
 --not just one but two main characters with damaged souls (yep eva has a dark soul too and it controls her) 
 there are some other small similarities to fsog but for the most part i found this book stood well on its own gideon was a damaged soul and the relationship between him and eva often felt like a co-dependent mess and not a true romance eva's past continues to haunt her so the main question is can two damaged souls build a healthy relationship beneath all the layers of their relationship i did believe they will find true love and heal as best they can from their past i never believed that with grey and ana in fsog this was a gripping story and i loved watching these two come together and try to get it right 
 if you are holding off reading this because you didn't like fsog you might miss out if you like dark edgy erotica romance with great writing then forget the comparison to fsog i can't wait to see how sylvia day closes their story

 sept 21 - audiobook review and update 
 the audiobook version of this book is really good loved the narrator 
 i think i enjoyed this book even more the second time through the connection between gideon and eva is so deep and emotionally raw and i think i connected with them even more in my re-read they are intensely interesting characters both individually and together as a couple i picked up on many of the subtle details this time that helps to further explain why they are damaged souls and why their turbulent relationship might be the healthiest thing for them you don't find love it finds you it's got a little bit to do with destiny fate and what's written in the stars

 twitter: http://wwwtwittercom/bookaliciousbb 
 instagram: http://wwwinstagramcom/bookaliciousbb it all started with a kiss 
 after which julia was all 
 and crank 
 yep that's his name first more than up for it all of a sudden said 
 at which point i was thinking 
 than they both went back to their lives and crank not being able to stop thinking about her writes a song 
 i'm thinking 
 but when julia hears it she's all 
 and i'm like 
 than there is loads of different drama after which crank is all 
 and than julia does something stupid like this 
 and i'm like 
 than she's all why did i do that 
 finally julia decides to sort her shit out and i'm all 
 after which they both end up 
 and all i can do is 
 and at the same time i read this hilarious book in 2015 that was the same year steve harvey announced the wrong winner at the miss universe pageant that doesn't have anything to do with this book but i watched that moment on repeat like eighteen times once upon a time there was a young woman with a dream a dream that women the world over could live in freedom as equals that they would have the right that many women have been denied for hundreds of years possibly more - to live healthy happy lives with partners who love and respect them and provide for their needs 
 then that young woman read dark prince - and her dreams were shattered 
 actually this is all a lie because that young woman the woman writing this review (yes it is i) didn't actually finish this twisted garble of a mess 
 now i know i know that i'm not always easy going on books i have a standard (though considering the fact that i have read all ten of the bdb books may convince people otherwise but that aside) i know i like the writing to be of a certain standard and for there to be characters of a certain quality and a plotline and world that has a certain depth and or immersive quality 
 from what i read this is less a novel and a how to guide how to travel to a distant country and ensure your body is never found after you get abducted abused and killed 
 first and simple step: 
 1 do everything raven whitney does in the first chapter of her book no i'm not kidding that really is her name aptly so as she has long silky raven hair (yes it's referred to as such in this book) which begs the question of what her parents were going to do if she'd been born with red hair or if she had been born with black hair it had all fallen out three weeks later (as it did with me) and grown back blonde 
 2 romanticize and imagine men like prince mikhail dubrinsky are sexy and possibly good life mates 
 they're not 
 ""but surely kat"" you say ""you can't have too much to say about a book when you only read twenty-two pages into it"" 
 you'd better believe i do 
 the book begins with mikhail lonely and contemplating ending his own life the following excerpt was actually published by the way i'm not making this shit up for giggles if i were it would probably be better: 
 ""grief overwhelmed him consumed him he lifted his head and roared out his pain like the wounded animal he was he could no longer bear to be alone"" 
 [image error] 
 so our female protagonist who has a psychic ability to connect with people mentally contacts him to cheer him up 
 he contacts back and love blooms 
 okay sounds alright right wrong wrong so freakin' wrong 
 our two protagonists psychically meet on page two he's sexually assaulting her with his mind by page 8 
 but it's okay because mikhail is a studly stud he's an immortal rich and extremely handsome petty things like laws and personal boundaries and respect for women mean nothing to him and they shouldn't mean anything to you either - this is the message of the book 
 by page eleven she has decided that he is mega creepy and decides to escape he psychically contacts her to tell her that he knows that she wants to run away and it just isn't going to fly and that he can and will force his will on her 
 now at this point the correct response would be: 
 a) leave 
 b) tell him to go get fucked and that if he so much as comes near you you will scream bloody murder and have him arrested for assault 
 c) give the psychopath your full name and casually head down to dinner 
 i leave you to guess which option our fuckwit heroine chooses 
 by page fifteen another man has casually placed his hand on our female protagonist's leg and invited her outside correct normal and balanced reaction from the male would be: 
 a) realize that this woman is a perfect stranger and therefor perfectly entitled to receive attention from other men 
 b) decide to stake your claim next time you see her and offer to be her one and only - hoping earnestly that she will choose you 
 c) use your psychic powers to attempt to kill him - stopping only when the female protagonist desperately entreats you to stop 
 by page seventeen our chauvinistic-pig and emotionally abusive asshole male protagonist has the female protagonist in his arms and is running through the forest to his home with her 
 raven being the clever and clearly cautious little monkey that she is asks ""did you kidnap me or rescue me"" 
 oh wait honey i think i know the answer to this one *kat thinks very very hard* 
 she tells him quite clearly on page nineteen that she wants to go home several times 
 his response ""you can not fight me little one"" 
 this is what he calls her by the way i don't know about you but if a man starts to call me 'little one' as opposed to oh i don't know my name - then he is going to get one serious round-house kick to the face 
 on page twenty when any normal and sane person would have taken the first opportunity to give him a swift kick to the cajones and run like hell the dumbest character i have ever come acrossno waitthe dumbest character i have ever come across enters his house of her own free will 
 she ignores all of his past behaviour because he somehow understands her he somehow connects to her he reaches deep inside her to a place that has never been touched by anyone else before i'd like to reach deep in and touch her brain because that obviously hasn't been touched before either 
 why is this crap romantic why why does this spawn a series that sells lots of copies and makes the author lots of money 
 the writing is not purple prose it is beyond purple prose purple prose would be embarrassed to be seen with this writing everything about it is bad 
 if you've seen the iron giant (lord if you haven't go watch now) then you'll know that in that movie is a giant robot made of iron yet this robot has a thousand times more personality and charisma than our much touted and manly prince mikhail 
 he's a robot some kind of space robot given a caveman's brain by an alien species intent to discover if stupidity in the human race is indeed limitless and thus perhaps mined as a kind of fuel for their spaceships this book was written by these aliens to test us and see how ridiculous we'll go 
 however if they have any success with this method - then i won't entirely argue with their plan because after all by the laws of supply and demand - it'd be cheaper to fill up my car with stupidity then it would with gas i loooooved this i found it to be so relatable and just amazing stayed tuned for a review/discussion to hear more thoughts le sighhhh theoi love a broken man more then i love pizzaand i love pizza 
 theo is the prefect broken manhe plays the part very wellnever stays in once place to long never lets anyone to close never connects with people 
 clair on the other had is the opposite of brokenshe is put together she has a home people who love her (not a special someoneyet) a great job she loves and she has her art 
 when you read a story like this you think that fate must have been playing a really big part in these two coming together 
 they compliment each other wellwhere theo is lacking trust and love clair has it in boat loads where clair lacks adventure and faith in the unknown and jumping with out looking theo has that all down pat they fit together like a puzzle pieceshe is straight lines while he is the jagged edges 
 this is a great story about not letting the past define you and breaking down your walls in order to let others in it's also a great second chances stories with many a lesson involved 
 if everything was easy all the time life would not be worth livingit's the challenges we face on this journey that make us the people we arethe people we are meant to be follow me on: facebook | instagram | twitter | blog 
 laurelin paige is a 
 master of words 
 when she writes she does it with such seamless precision it hits you everywhere in all the feels her storytelling is exceptional impeccable it rivals some of the best for me once again i find myself in awe of her creative talent consumed by the way she writes i'm almost at a loss for words 
 this duology is one of the best i have ever had the pleasure of reading the execution it all came together so flawlessly that words like brilliant phenomenal spectacular just don't do it justice there's nothing i could say that would live up to the magic that's buried deep inside these pages i'm blown away by the intricate plot line by the cataclysmic emotion that erupts inside the reader by the depth of character development it's a gritty ride like no other; utterly wild infinitely frustrating wholly intense one that's more than memorable one i'll be holding onto for a very long while 
 first touch was one of my top reads of last year i loved it so much that a part of me dreaded reading last kiss sequels can be challenging and i've been let down in the past however with the cliffhanger ending that left me reeling i was just as desperate to get my hands on this book those two emotions---dread and desperation--warred with in me when i finally sat down to read and i found myself obsessing over everything i was scared that this might not go the way i wanted it to the way i needed it to my attachment to these characters ran deep i was invested my heart was on the line 
 that said if there was ever a sequel that trumped a first in a series it would be this 
 i was left breathless 
 from dread to despair to anger to frustration to feeling hot and bothered all over laurelin delivered big time she showed me--the reader--that once again she owns every line in her books she's knows exactly what she's doing and we can trust her to take us on a ride that's more than worth it 
 last kiss picks up exactly where first touch leaves off i'm not getting into plot details i don't want someone who hasn't read the first book to stumble on this review and have it all ruined just know you're in for a whirlwind that's simply unforgettable 
 emily has codependency issues she's complex and infuriating it's not an easy ride the emotional attachment she has to her ex best friend is weaved into the strands of who she is those threads are thick and almost impossible to sever and at the end of the day emily doesn't trust herself to make good decisions she's desperate for approval and many a time i broke for her i love this woman f**ked up crazy impulsive submissive reckless lost damaged it didn't matter i loved her with a passion i understood the dark in her i craved the same things she did i found myself sick with the very same emotions she was experiencing she's a complicated character her issues run deep yet her heart is pure goodness 
 reeve continues to be our brazen dominant man in this series he's everything an alpha male should be i absolutely adore the way he's as harsh as he is tender his cruelty is a turn on he ruins you and puts you back together i fell head of heels in love with that possessive controlling man he's everything i want and once again my love for him was cemented in ways i couldn't have ever imagined no one comes close to his intensity his protectiveness his heart but his moments of vulnerability really destroy me my god i love him his fierce loyalty is so sexy he would do anything for the woman he loves 
 this story is messy it's multifaceted dark and gritty there's nothing that the author shies away from she writes with a ferocity that is visceral and palpable last kiss is a tsunami of feels the twists and turns will take you everywhere i highly recommend this series i'm completely blown away and i can't say anything but amazing things it's unforgettable 
 *** arc provided in exchange for honest review from netgalley *** this was super cute and really interesting 
 more thoughts and possibly a bibliobabble to come i don't even know what this is about but after the hating game: surprise surprise this is my first time giving a colleen hoover book one star as a rating actually i have never never (ha) rated one of her works less than three stars her novels are usually enjoyable but i very much disliked this oneand am not going to feel sorry about it there are some books on goodreads that you can feel uncomfortable writing a negative review for because of how many of your friends loved it or people in general but i'm not going to let this one be one of them never never you sucked missed the mark so badly 
 first off this is not new adult; it's young adult the characters are in a freaking high school and there is freaking high school boy drama secondly this is not a story; it's a big and frustrating teaser if we had an entire novel what i just read would have been the first two chapters of it (because i'm taking out the useless ones only meaning to confuse us more) in fact it is as if the authors told themselves ''the more we confuse our readers and add unexplained information the more they're going to freak and love it'' nuh-uh yes for the former: i am indeed freaking out at how much i disliked this but never in a million years would i come to love this short story (ugh it even hurts to call it that) 
 alright so you're probably wondering about the characters now are they nice beautiful well-developped 
 ''i think my mother may be a bitch'' 
 yeah that was charlie the main character you just heard she thinks her mom is a bitch because the latter wants to protect her against silas whom took her husband away from her - i assume - and hurt charlie but are we given real detail on that well of course not that would have been giving the readers too soon what they want why not let them linger a little while longeruntil may 2015 perhaps i hope this is at least a duology let's not even start on silas the author pictured him as a guy hopelessly in love with charlie (even before really knowing her) with so much intensity that i wasn't convinced anymore it was too much and too soon 
 there is cheating (it may not count for some but that made me doubt charlie and silas' true feelings for each other) 
 there are plenty of unanswered questions (how did they lose their memories and why because they wanted to forget what they did to each other why did they do that in the first place what did charlie's dad do - more detail please what did the files contain) 
 there is a cliffhanger 
 there is an insta-love vibe and a high paranormal one too it's a very unrealistic contemporary story with a hard to imagine and unbelievable romance and a deal of under-developed secondary characters and the writing wasn't even that good simplistic and sometimes in contradiction with the personality of the characters often in the book silas says how he doesn't like what charlie does with a voice that implies more ''i dislike this chick'' than ''i'm deeply in love with this beautiful girl'' 
 also this: 
 i'm standing on the edge of the lawn looking down his street when he walks up behind me i don't hear him approach but i smell him i don't know how since he smells like the outdoors 
 this is ridiculous are you sure you didn't sense him instead *shakes head* 
 i did not like this and would not even recommend it to my worst enemy i know many of you liked it though and i respect that i'm debating whether reading the sequel or not because who would be okay with having so many unanswered questions on their minds but i will not prioritize it even a tiny little bit i have something to share and it's not an std 
 it's a deleted scene from 'dating-ish' and i think you're all going to enjoy it (at least you'll enjoy it more than an std i think)

 where the fuck is the rest of the book i waited a whole goddam year for this bullshit i cant even fucking rate  
 original review 
 team lucca all the motherfucking way how to write a paranormal romance 
 step one 
 : create a sue 
 this is a female lead that can either be a mary sue a jerk sue or a sympathetic sue just an fyi most writers go with a mary as the ideal of women remaining virgins until they find ""the one"" is allegedly still vastly appealing to the masses i suggest creating a heroine that's never even been attracted to a man before it makes it seem more like it's fate when she meets the male lead and less like you're trying to shove antiquated beliefs down your reader's throats 
 step two 
 : create a ragebeast 
 your male lead should be over six feet tall have dark hair tattoos and so much testosterone-inflated muscle that he has to walk through doors sideways the less he talks the better in every scene that you're tempted to give him dialogue instead make him brood over something you're going for caveman here modern women don't want a partner that can communicate feelings or sympathize with emotions we just want someone who can bench press twice our body weight 
 if you really want to make us swoon make him a prince too or an uber-alpha or a frigging king that will fulfill the princess fantasy that half of us are infected with thanks to those assholes over at disney 
 step three 
 : make these two the exception to each other's rules 
 emotionally cripple the male he shouldn't believe in love not until he sees your mary sue when he finally lays eyes on her however you can take that caveman frown and turn it upside down i suggest blaring foreigner's i wanna know what love is on repeat while writing this scene as it will really help you capture the emotion your readers should be feeling at this point 
 and remember that lack of attraction to the opposite sex you've afflicted mary with well when she lays eyes on your beast of a male lead her va-jay-jay should turn into the river nile 
 step four 
 : the shmushing together of squishy bits 
 sex add it lots of it on a bed in the bathroom of a club a stairwell an alleyway you get the drift just know that the more you mix it up the better repetition is the bane of the sex scene's existence also we'd really appreciate it if you could avoid using these phrases: 
 1 slippery juices 
 * this brings up safety concerns 
 2 clenching womb 
 * she's having sex not a baby 
 3 pulsating sausage 
 * i like breakfast cooked thanks 
 4 squelch 
 * i shouldn't have to explain this one 
 step five 
 : don't forget the mystery 
 as tempting as it may seem you can't just fill up three hundred pages with nothing but relationship angst because if you do 
 i will 
 people may hate you you'll want to add in an actual plot line to avoid that don't worry it's not as hard as it sounds make up a creepy crawly bad guy have him kill some innocent people and maybe torture a kid or rape someone and your readers will immediately hate him and get behind your mcs and their fight for 'good' you don't even have to get that heavy with it in fact you can probably squeeze it in between your gymnastic-inspired sex scenes 
 step six 
 : climax the literary kind 
 have the bad guy kidnap the heroine feel free to let him slap her around a little and hint at the terrible things he's going to do to her but don't get too carried away here as you may offend those with delicate sensitivities just before the villain can carry out these dastardly plans have the hero save your mary sue what well yes that's a little damsel-in-distress-ish but trust me on this everyone else is doing it too and no one's complaining about it yet you want readers or not lady 
 step seven 
 : heas; they're not just for fairy tales and contemporary romances 
 end your book on a high note your readers don't want cliffhangers or dead male leads they want to see a white dress or a bad guy with coins on his eyes because your ragebeast eviscerated him before rescuing the heroine and taking her back to his 'lair' to bang the hell out of her regardless of her emotional mental or physical bruises 
 one plus of going light on the plotline (like i suggested) is that it makes it easy to wrap things up in a nice little bow you're welcome 
 okay so this all sounds rather critical and it is i'm sure you're wondering ""so why the four stars"" well in my opinion this author takes all the themes i've mentioned and does them well which makes for one entertaining and sexy read 
 this review can also be found at the alliterates gunshy: is a full length standalone novel by lili st germain spoken in 'dual perspectives' leo bentley & cassandra carlino aka cassie 
 this kicks starts us off in a dark gritty place seventeen year old karen a troubled teenage girl who had gone missing in gun creek a week prior her severed body is discovered in a well on a local property by leo nine years ago 
 itaeur(tm)s not every morning you drink dead girl juice 
 after taking a long gulp of water out of a glass he knew straight away something wasnaeur(tm)t right the taste alone made him gag the colour of the water didnaeur(tm)t seem right either with it being a dirty rusty red colour climbing down the well thataeur(tm)s when all was revealed 
 something forever changed in leo that day gone was his easy go lucky happy nature and in itaeur(tm)s place was a different boy entirely 
 one year later a car careens down an embankment during a snowstorm nineteen year old leo at the wheel sent to prison for nineteen years for driving under the influence one female forever locked in a coma this event forever changes the people in this small town secrets lies and deceit become an act of survival leo's and cassie's lives will never be the same 
 released from lovelock penitentiary for good behaviour nothing is the same the town has changed the people have changed 
 i left behind a girl and now that i'm back that girl is gone she's a woman now with pain in her eyes that i put here 
 another girl goes missing nine years after karen brainard which could send him back to prison again facing the death penalty if he reveals what he knows about her disappearance 
 at this point in the story this is where the author opens up a can of worms because boom boom boom events from this stage onwards because from this point onwards the events that unfold will definitely give you whiplash keeping up 
 my thoughts: what a crazy assed dark psychological thriller this one was i feel like iaeur(tm)ve been pulled through a hedge backwards the twists and turns the dark and grit just kept coming and coming and along the way you feel and connect with these characters 
 in typical lili fashion as per usual i'm left reeling gobsmacked stunned sitting down and writing up this review and wondering what the fuck did i just read this was one fucked up crazy assed ride this book threw many twists many curve balls that had me reeling in their aftermath like a tornado that has ripped through a town left floundering in its wake this book exceeded all my expectations ticked all my boxes and left me wanting more i can not wait to see what lili brings us next i highly recommend this it's dark twisted raw disturbing gritty and highly addictive i'm almost finished writing this baby so can't wait to share much swooning here :) i received a copy in exchange for an honest review 
 i couldn't wait to get my hands on this book not only because it is by the lovely and talented m never but after i read an excerpt and experienced the smooth talking southern boy steaming up a supply closet and calling someone ""sugar"" i just knew i had to experience the southern night series before long i was completely enraptured with kamdyn and laney's emotional and heated story hoping that the push and pulls of life jealousy and celebrity status wouldn't stop them from being together 
 kamdyn ellis had my heart pitter pattering right from the start even when laney made him ""work hard"" to prove he wasn't just a player anymore looking for a good time i fell hard for his southern charm early on as the story progressed i came to love everything about kam from his sweet nicknames for laney his smokin' hot muscles down to his caring heart he really is completely laney's whether she believes it or not 
 laney summers is a sassy city girl through and through and shows it with every bit of feistiness that she throws kam's way on every page i love this heroine that has to learn the hard way that she can trust kam with her heart and has to keep apologizing for all of the misunderstandings between her and kam she lives up to her nickname ""lemon"" and her snarky comebacks to kam's endless charm keeps readers entertained and hanging on to every word 
 m never delivers another scorching hot couple that has you laughing and tumbling head first in love with them from the very beginning of their love/hate antics i highly recommend the southern night series for a love story that takes readers through great depth of emotions in their relationship that starts budding in high school and blooms past the college years kam and laney are sure to have you doing the in zone dance and ending the last page with a smile on your face and two more characters weighing heavy on your heart m never knows how to score with the readers whether she is writing about a football hottie or two smokin' hot twin brothers she changes our hearts forever and keeps us coming back for more"
6,young adult," this book cost me around 600 dollars. 
 when i'm traveling to and from conventions, i use the airplane time to catch up on my reading. a lot of times this means i'm taking the opportunity to read books that have been popular for a while, but that i haven't gotten around to. i feel like i should be aware of the landscape. 
 anyway, on my way home from seattle, i had a layover in minneapolis. i grabbed this book so i'd have something to read while i was eating dinner in the airport. 
 so i ate dinner, and i read the book, and i lost track of time, and i missed my plane. 
 i ended up having to rent a car and drive the three and a half hours back to stevens point. 
 you win this round, cassandra clare.... video review - http://bit.ly/1rlgyvm 
 new addition to my ""all time favorites"" list. possibly new #1 all time favorite. i adored this book. funny and cute and clever with a cool plot and fun world and plenty of squee-inducing moments. i've read the whole book through twice, going on my third read. and there are some chapters i've read at least six or seven times. and the book has been out a week. i'm obsessed. i put the book down and all i want is to pick it up again. aleister crowley, i'm living a charmed life. spoilery book discussion here - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_gl7... 
 this was absolutely everything i wanted and never knew i needed. thank you sarah for this perfect beautiful book. 
 here are some of my spoiler-free impressions: 
 dorian. precious cinnamon roll. i can't. 
 aelin. queen of shadows. more like queen of slaying yasssss get it girl. 
 rowan. i'm screaming. 
 chaol. more screaming. 
 aedion!!! lysandra!!! manon!!! arobynn!!!!!!!!! 
 i had about twelve heart attacks while reading this book. it was awesome. how to write popular ya supernatural literature and defile your spirit! 
 based on the popular ya novel, evermore, and aided by countless more like it, i have compiled an easy to read and follow list of rules for writing a popular series and being able to sell out your soul at the same time. does that sound too convenient? well, it's unbelievably easy to do if you follow my quick and easy program! 
 1. create an 'outcast' heroine. 
 it's important that your primarily female teenage audience can relate to your main character. so whilst you can't have your main character associate herself with being cool, it still has to be obvious to your audience that she totally is. now, meyer's approach of the goose-turned swan-but was really still a goose, bella, associated herself as 'different' and a 'loner' only to arrive at her new school and be immediately popular and accepted by almost everyone. noel's method is different yet in a similar spirit. her protagonist, ever, was incredibly popular at her old school and has decided to be an outcast because she feels that she can't be accepted due to her psychic gift. she also has the ability to perceive someone's personality through the colours that define them. so instead of aligning herself with the shallow, mean and popular crowd, she aligns herself with the shallow and mean loners. 
 it's very important for your protagonists to be 'different' because today's youth despise the sheep mentality and so they all strive to be unique. since they're all different in almost the exact same way, it is relatively easy to emulate this, with as little effort put into characterization as possible, in your female protagonist. 
 as long as she shows no regard for her clothing, appearance or any kind of interest in giving a shit about anyone but herself she will easily pass with young audiences. it will be her ewniqueness that eventually draws the perfect hero to her as opposed to any of the usual elements such as: looks, hygiene, personality or determinable interest in the world outside their own arse. 
 please also remember that she probably should be a reader, preferably of wuthering heights or romeo and juliet and that she should consider everyone around her to have inferior intelligence despite the fact that her reading repertoire extends to only a couple of books. 
 a noticeably absent family is necessary and a completely dead family makes for a better story because then she actually has a perceived reason to be a moody, antisocial, self-absorbed little bitch. do this even though, in all likelihood, she would be all of the above with a perfectly normal family. 
 2. create a perfect hero. 
 it is very important that your hero be perfect in almost every regard. unlike the female protagonist who can disregard her appearance, he must not only be more attractive than a gq model without any of the effort put into his appearance, but he must also be thoughtful, intelligent and mysterious. 
 in no way is he to reflect almost every teenage boy to have ever existed and he must have no desire to find a partner for himself who is in anyway comparable in looks, kindness, intelligence or perfection. 
 if he is a vampire or some such immortal then he must be ridiculously wealthy. if he is a werewolf then he is allowed to be poor but must make up for it with incredible bedroom skills. 
 he needn't have a personality that extends beyond mysterious, sexy and in love with the female protagonist. naturally, in this respect, meyers, mead, marr and stiefvater are something like overachievers - but if noel, saintcrow, clare, kate and fitzpatrick are any indication, then we need know little more about the hero other than the fact that he's gorgeous, has a secret and is in love. history, friends, likes, dislikes, family, passions, interests, hobbies and personality flaws are all negligible information that is taking up precious space in your novel. especially when you could be injecting more drooling from the female protagonist in place of any kind of characterization for your hero. 
 your book will sell better if the hero stalks, follows, obsesses over and actively pursues the heroine beyond any realm of believability. you could triple your audience just by having him watch her sleep. 
 3. create useless friends. 
 it's important to reiterate to the young adult generation that nobody other than the hero is important. since domestic abuse begins with one partner manoeuvring the other to have limited contact with anyone else, we must strive to normalize this in literature. thus the female protagonist shouldn't have anyone close enough to her that she can't break contact or eventually forget about them. it's very important that her full focus, socialization and all of her needs are eventually devoted or met by the male protagonist. 
 to aid this, her friends must be selfish, vain, crazy, slutty, uncaring or in other ways undeserving of the heroine's attentions and affections. it's very important that she never call them on their poor, damaging and graceless friendship but must lovingly worry about them for the minimal amount of time acceptable to the reader before once again completely focusing on the mysterious hero. 
 4. mix in a twisted, convoluted plot designed entirely to provide dramatic and sexy subplot. 
 it's important that the plot, no matter how unlikely, must revolve around the hero saving the heroine. the villains do not necessarily need to have realistic or conceivable motivations for their actions. as long as the hero gets to save the day at least three or four times then your book will be profitable! 
 please remember that the actual plot of your story needn't truly begin until at least 350 pages into your story. the longer you can stall any interesting event occuring, the less thinking you will actually need to do. 
 plus - for free - extras to help 'improve' your novel, the bottom line of your sales, and the expedient destruction of your soul. 
 -how to create a senseless mythology. 
 mythology is more of a concept rather than something that needs to be respected or honoured. vampires don't need to refrain from daylight and angels no longer need to ""fall"" for good they can now be redeemed like us! the good news is that creating your own mythology, disregarding anything written before, allows you to twist and bastardize the plot beyond any recognizably interesting concept! 
 -explanations as to why research could actually damage your profit! 
 research takes time, energy and intelligence. why do it? you've got ten fingers (presumably) and an attention span that extends past anything that could be compared to a gnat (even if it is only barely). simply make it up as you go! for example: ever is psychic. research may tell us that this has something to do with receiving visions of the future or possibly commnicating with ghosts. yet research is boring. instead, she is imbued with the following powers that we guess can kind of be put under a psychic umbrella if we force enough information and logic out of our brains first: mind reading, visions of near-present and future, personal life knowledge of any person she physically touches, seeing ghosts, seeing auras, literary osmosis from touching any written object, drawing the answers from any written question placed before her and any other supernatural abilities that seem convenient at the time. 
 -detailed observations on why the deus ex machina rocks. 
 tying together a plot, even if you work to keep it as non-complicated or infantile as possible, is hard! it's much easier to ignore tying together a number of plot points in any believable fashion and instead rely on some deus ex machina to come in and take care of thoughtful planning for you! 
 -how to expand one, nonsensical idea into a series and why this is more profitable than originality! 
 last, but not least! ensure that your story is somewhat open ended so that you can create a series out of it! research shows that people, even if they are intelligent enough to see that you're writing is becoming progressively shittier and nonsensical, will often still purchase books in the series in order to find out what happens. so rather than creating a new story with new characters, simply beat the same old horse (it needn't really be a horse - simply a pile of shit that's been forced into a horse-like shape) for at least three or more books in order to squeeze every last cent out of the franchise that you can! 
 this review can also be found on my blog, cuddlebuggery book blog. i need more...... ""i cheated on her every day. in my mind, i thought of you in ways i shouldn't have, again and again. she was nothing compared to you. i've never felt this way about anybody before--"" 
 what's the saying? once a cheater, always a cheater? oh, the fucking hypocrisy. 
 there were many things i wanted to do to anna oliphant throughout this book. some of them involve a bottle of choloroform, a shovel, and an unmarked grave. mostly, i just want to bring anna in front of the us congress as an example of how the us educational system has grievously failed our students. to be frank, anna oliphant is a motherfucking idiot. 
 yeah, i guess you could say this is a sweet romance, but it's not the good sort of sweet. it's the ""oh my god, why did i eat that entire package of oreos? i don't even like oreos!"" sort of sweet. it's sickening, and best in small doses, and i still feel like i need an internal cleanse after spreading the reading of this book over several days. the good thing about it is that this book isn't the sugar-free type of sweet, so there were no anal explosions. it wasn't the worst contemporary i've ever read, but this book was tremendously annoying and i simply do not understand the hype. i know many of people enjoyed it, and i can see why. anna is the sort of character that grows on you, much like mildew, or herpes. once you get used to having it, it doesn't really bother you much anymore. 
 i'm not opposed to romance. i love romance, but i read this book hoping to be swept away by a romance. instead, i was sucked into a whirlwind of idiocy. 
 oh, the stupidity!!: 
 the only french word i know is oui, which means ""yes,"" and only recently did i learn it's spelled o-u-i and not w-e-e. 
 people like anna oliphant is the reason why everyone hates americans. anna is 17, and she is a moron. she is the epitome of the stupid, ignorant, egocentric american. for fuck's sakes, she thinks there are motherfucking mimes on every fucking corner in france. she thinks that people go watch mimes as an everyday pastime! 
 i'm going to be sick. i'm going to vomit that weird eggplant tapenade i had for dinner, and everyone wil hear, and no one will invite me to watch the mimes escape from their invisible boxes, or whatever it is people do here in their spare time. 
 i'm sorry, but i'm inclined to judge anyone who doesn't know that 
 oui 
 is spelled o-u-i and not w-e-e. it's one of those foreign words that isn't even fucking foreign because it's so fucking common. oui is yes in french. si is yes in spanish. it's one of those words that's so fucking commonly used that you have to be a complete birdbrain not to know! 
 anna is terrified of anything foreign, although to me, france really isn't that foreign or exotic, but i didn't grow up in atlanta. is atlanta really that ass-fucking backward? is atlanta really completely isolated from the rest of the world, despite being one of the biggest cities in the us (anna's words). do they not have paninis in atlanta? 
 ""where have you been all my life?"" i ask the beautiful panini. ""how is it possible i've never had a sandwich like this before?"" 
 not only is she ignorant, she has no survival skills. anna is in paris, attending a school for americans. fucking everyone speaks english, the french teachers speak english. anna is terrified of getting food in the cafeteria and avoids the cafeteria for weeks because she doesn't know how to order food. 
 let me tell you a brilliant way of ordering food, in any language. you smile, you make eye contact at the desired food, you point, you nod. it's motherfucking universal. 
 i hate to say it, but if you're a pretty girl, you can get anyone's help (most likely a guy, but often another girl, too) just by looking cute and helpless and tilting your head at an angle (guilty as charged). it ain't feminist, but it works when one is desperate, and the fact that anna doesn't have the fucking common sense to do this instead of hiding in her room for weeks like a motherfucking pussy doesn't bring her up in my estimation. i'm not judging anna for being shy. anna is not shy. i was a shy, shy teenager. anna is incompetent. there is a difference between incompetency and shyness. 
 after weeks and weeks of going to classes, of learning french...anna doesn't know how to fucking spell ""please"" in french. 
 mer is next in line, and i transcribe her speech phonetically. 
 oon ploss see voo play. 
 that's suppsed to be une place, s'il vous plait. 
 her impression of paris is one with like, blah blah marie antoinette and that really short dude, like, i think his name is napoleon? you know, like, the one on the horse in that painting by that dude? and oh my god, the moulin rouge, and that cute little movie with the little girl in the yellow thingy! madeline! 
 and this is a chick who wants to be a film critic when she grows up. 
 my dream is to study film theory in california. i want to be our nation's greatest female film critic. 
 although judging from the way she thinks, i think she's more suited to a career writing for the tabloids, the type with the sort of ""president obama caught in interplanetary orgy along with putin and merkel"" headline rather than as a film critic. 
 i wonder if matt is a better kisser now that he has someone more experienced to practice on. he was probably a bad kisser because of me. 
 oh, no. 
 i'm a bad kisser. i am, i must be. 
 someday i'll be awarded a statue shaped like a pair of lips, and it'll be engraved with the words world's worst kisser.and matt will give a speech about how he only dated me because he was desperate, but i didn't put out, so i was a waste of time because cherrie milliken liked him all along and she totally puts out. 
 oh god. does toph think i'm a bad kisser? 
 anna, anna, anna!!!!!: so beautiful without knowing it!! so perfect! so adorably fucking clumsy! she even looks gorgeous when she falls flat on her fucking face! 
 ""you're beautiful."" 
 i trip and fall down on the sidewalk. 
 i look away as he takes my hand and helps me up. ""i'm fine. fine!"" i say, brushing the grit from my palms. oh my god, i am a freak. 
 ""you've seen the way men look at you, right?"" he continues. 
 ""if they're looking, it's because i keep making a fool of myself."" 
 i've seen this before. and it ain't cute. spare me the whole adorkable thing. i don't like zooey deschanel, and i don't like anna. it just looks like she's trying too fucking hard, and the cute but oh-so-clumsy trope is just so fucking overplayed right now. i wash my hands of it. 
 it's not blatant, but the relationships between the girls in this book are meant to portray anna as the good one, the best one, the most adorakablest girly girl in the whole wide fucking world. rashmi is ""rash."" cute. i don't think so. mer is just a little chubby. volleyball player chubby, but it's ok ^_^; amanda the slut, amanda the bitch. and anna. anna is just so good because you know, she feels really bad that etienne likes her, so she does everything she can to make mer not jealous. it's not mer's fault that she's not good enough for etienne! and boy, saint anna keeps reminding us that she's a good person! 
 and poor ellie. poor ellie, etienne's girlfriend. but surely, it's ok for etienne to cheat on ellie with anna if she looks like a slut, right? 
 slutty nurse. i don't believe it. tiny white button-up dress, red crosses across the nipples. cleavage city. 
 cheating is ok if your girlfriend is a bitch: that's the message that this book sends. oh, that ellie. that stupid, stuck up ellie. ellie who thinks she is better than everyone else. surely it's fine if etienne seeks comfort elsewhere if his girlfriend is a cold fish, a stuck up snot, right? no. i don't fucking think so. how about you break up with her first? just because a girl is a jerk doesn't mean she deserves to be cheated on. i do not appreciate the way this book sends the message that it's morally acceptable to cheat on a girlfriend who neglects you! but it's morally acceptable to cheat on her if you feeeeeeeeeeeeel bad about it, right? fuck this shit. 
 the cheating: and yes, it is cheating. what do you call this? 
 ""i said you were beautiful. i slept in your bed!"" 
 ""you never made a move! you had a girlfriend!"" 
 ""no matter what a terrible boyfriend i was, i wouldn't actually cheat on her. but i thought you'd know. with me being there, i thought you'd know."" 
 ok. etienne has a girlfriend, ellie. etienne holds hands with anna. he is still with ellie. 
 it's nice holding hands. comfortable. 
 i wish friends held hands more often, like the children i see on the streets sometimes. i'm not sure why we have to grow up and get embarrassed about it. 
 you know why? because you wouldn't like it if etienne held hands with another girl if he was dating you. fucking hypocrite. 
 friends don't sleep in each others' beds. 
 i mean i didn't sleep sleep with him. obviously. but i slept with him. 
 i slept with a boy! i burrow back down into my sheets and grin. 
 and that boy has a girlfriend. and then you do it again. while he still has a girlfriend. while you have an almost-boyfriend. 
 you make eye contact and blush at each other in a theatre. while he has a girlfriend. 
 you kiss each other. while he has a girlfriend. while you have an almost-boyfriend. 
 you flirt with each other. while he has a girlfriend. while you have an almost-boyfriend. 
 i don't see this relationship lasting very long. ughhhhh i neeeeddd morrrreeeeee ""graceling meets selection"" whatever marketing team came up with that tag for this series clearly never read the book. red queen is game of thrones with katniss as the mockingjay with x-men in a tantalizing ya twist of magical perfection. 
 three quotes that summarize this series spoiler-free: 
 ""anyone can betray anyone."" meet the lannisters silver court and their current royal family. 
 ""make no mistake, my girl. you are playing the game as someone's pawn."" 
 ""i am a fool."" 
 sooooooooo... my initial reaction: 
 i have to wait another year??? let me repeat: i have to wait another year??? 
 ...yeaaaaa, i'm totally cool with that. not. 
 okay, now before i go all crazy fan girl let me start by saying that no one, and i repeat, no one, had higher expectations for this than me (well, maaaaybe victoria:d). i am the world's biggest medieval/dystopian ya fantasy nut & i have been looking for a book like this my whole life. my whole life, people!!! so it isn't a high stretch of imagination to say with all the hype i was expecting to be let down. because let's face it: most of the hype let's you down (thank you million dollar marketing campaigns for all the *cough, cough* next-big-things). 
 (and in case you are wondering i never wanted to read hunger games or harry potter so while those blew my mind in a totally awesome way they were never really on my tbr to begin with, red queen on the other hand has been a book i thought i would love from the beginning). 
 and then the hype got bigger: 
 reviewers i follow and love start saying magical words like ""shatter me,"" ""darkling,"" and ""x-men-like powers."" 
 so this was me one minute before midnight when red queen released: 
 and guess what??? it beat my over-hyped up imagination. this book is now one of my favorites of all time!!! red queen is everything a ya medieval fantasy should be. i loved every minute of it. 
 alright. now to my actual thoughts on this book. i marked the whole thing as a spoiler because i am lazy but yea, trust me when i say you don't want this ruined (so read on at your own peril): 
 1. ""little lightning girl."" okay, yea, the way they use her reminded me a lot of mockingjay. not going to lie. 
 2. cal - shame on you, you hot beautiful prince, you. you were totally scamming and making move's on your brother's girl. i know you are supposed to come off as this nice guy but before maven turned out to be evil i seriously did not like you. i mean i was totally rooting for you and mare (*gasps that dance scene*) but i was mad at you for being the popular/likable guy when you were totally secretly making eyes at your brother's wife that you know he's falling for. that said i still loved your romance scenes and i do like you. i will admit to my sickness. 
 3. maven. maven, maven, maven. hello darkling meets joffrey. kind of like malfoy with a heart. y'all know that scene in harry potter i'm talking about: 
 so needless to say i am secretly in love with him. because i am shameless and always root for the complicated guy and/or villain love interest. 
 #teamwarnerdarklingmorpheusjacedamonsalvatoredaemonblack -and now maven. 
 4. this book totally has a love triangle (maybe more, you can never tell with the childhood friend what's-his-name). but strangely enough i enjoyed it. it played out to my guilty pleasure side. if maven wasn't in this book i would totally be in love with cal, and vice versa. i loved them both. the only other time i have loved both guys in a love triangle was cassandra clare's infernal devices series (and even then i still obviously preferred will, but i was definitely okay with both). 
 5. there were definite cliches/overused tropes: 
 ""you're going to be his brother's wife. and he's going to war."" 
 ""i am the little lightning girl, and i am going to make the world change."" 
 ... but i was down with them. because tropes & cliches are there for a reason. we all secretly love them. we just don't love them when the writing sucks. 
 only trope i hated: the instalove with cal & mare, i was cool with it until (i apologize for the rant) this happened: 
 maven shakes his head. ""he [cal] will always choose you."" 
 >> really? yea, he liked her but now everyone was suddenly ""cal will choose you over his country?"" umm. no. that part annoyed me to no end because while i was down with instalike i was not down with instalove (and i did not interpret cal as that much of an idiot). thank the gods that turned out not to be true. it's cool that cal hesitated but if he had actually chosen mare i would have lost respect for him. instead i gained so much more for him standing up to her and turning her in. way to go, cal!!! 
 6. the brother shade. wtf? why didn't the guard tell her about him if he was still alive? that twist annoyed me. they didn't suspect maven so they had no reason to keep it a secret. maybe i missed something but that was the only plot hole of the book and honestly it was so small i didn't care. 
 7. queen elara (enough said): ""like any wife, she hates her husband for challenging her, and like any queen, she hates the power the king holds over her."" 
 now onto my favorite scene... let's be honest: it was everyone's. we all knew a big twist was coming but it was still so epic. and helloooo darkling aka maven. i knew you were more than just your brother's shadow. 
 ""he rolls his shoulders, cracking his bones to chase away an ache. his motions are sluggish and strange, and when he settles back on his feet, hands on hips, i feel like i'm seeing him for the first time. his eyes are so cold."" 
 the queen was way too much of a biatch to just stand on the sidelines with the most awesome power (whisper!) of all. 
 ""because she already knew. because he is her son. because this was her plan all along."" 
 when malfoy/joffrey listened to cersei lannister maven listened to his mother i had this image in my head: 
 followed by a wish that mare had her powers back to do this: 
 i loved every minute of this book, guys. read it now. i literally bookmarked every single page. and not just the maven parts, guys, all of it!!! 
 and finally my favorite line of the whole book: 
 ""this was the shadow controlling the flame."" 
 yea, i know, i'm #teammaven. i know you are all #teamcal, hence i leave you with this: 
 omg i cannot wait for the next book!!! i hate this book. absolutely hate it. not just from the bottom of my heart (which would literally mean my ventricles, and so, no) but with my whole heart. i hate it, hate it, hate it. 
 i hate the fact that it made me laugh, so hard! 
 i hate the fact that it made me smile, so much! 
 i hate the fact that it made me chuckle, so profusely! 
 i hate the fact that it gifted me with so much laughter, smiles and chuckles when i was expecting to come face to face with tragedy at any moment....it changed my expectations, made me believe in something which did not happen...or maybe did happen. 
 i hate the fact that while hazel grace 
 fell in love the way you fall asleep: slowly, and then all at once 
 , i just 
 fell 
 ...no warning, no time to process the myriad emotions coursing through me, nope, nothing, just a huge endless void-filled fall and then a sudden crash that took my breath away, like literally... 
 i hate the fact that i fell in love with this bound-to-end-in-oblivion, bound-to-end-in-disaster boy who stared with blue blue eyes and put the killing thing right between his teeth, but never gave it the power to do its killing. (putting a cigarette right between your teeth and never lighting it, yes, that's augustus waters for you, people, a guy huge on metaphors and symbolism...that hopeless boy). 
 i hate the fact that when i least expected it, the story, the words just grabbed me and pulled me in so deep that even the thought of ever resurfacing never entered my mind. 
 i hate that the fact that right in the middle of my dance in the rain of laughter, dry wit, and humour without any warning, without any lightning as it's precedent, this thunder would stun me, startle me, wipe the smile right off my face, and sober me up, wake me up from the intoxication of the very real yet false jocularity spun by them, a humour which was nothing but human tragedy waiting-to-happen-and-had-already-happened in disguise and then push me back into that rain to dance again. 
 i hate the fact that i'm not making my much sense right now....that right now 
 my thoughts are stars i can't fathom into constellations... 
 and yes, all the hate above is a metaphor, a symbolic word for love... weird, right? but right now i can't bring myself to say that i love this book....i don't, i don't, i don't (yes, i do, i do, i do...) 
 so, *deep breath*, it's a story of a girl named hazel grace lancaster, a girl diagnosed with thyroid cancer at the age of 13 who's still alive at 16 thanks to a miracle drug which didn't work it's miracle in about 70% of the people but it did work in her. 
 so, even though her lungs suck at being lungs, she's still alive and well not kicking, but breathing, with difficulty (because remember her lungs suck at being lungs), but breathing nonetheless. 
 she's been nothing but a terminal case ever since her diagnosis. the doctors are simply finding ways of keeping her alive rather than removing the cancer ridden lungs and replacing it with a new one, because let's face it, her chances of surviving such an operation are like next to nothing and why waste a good pair of lungs on a given, bound-to-fail body? 
 so, hazel has never been anything but terminal, her final chapter inscribed upon diagnosis. 
 enter augustus waters. he's 17, gorgeous, in remission, and very frankly and much to her surprise interested in her. 
 it's a match made in cancer kid support group, in the literal heart of jesus (you'll know what that means when you read the book...you'll laugh, trust me, you will). 
 he is a tenured professor in the department of slightly crooked smiles with a dual appointment in the department of having a voice that made my skin feel more like skin. 
 he's the unexpected, hot, gorgeous twist in her story...a story which is about to be completely rewritten... 
 their story begins with a staring contest...he stares at her... 
 so she stares back...because let's face it... 
 (spoiler alert: she wins.) 
 and it progresses into something brilliant, something as bright as the stars, into something with a capital s.... 
 i hate this book. (this needs indefinite repetitions, i hate it). 
 i hate the fact that i fell in love with their always. 
 ""okay"" 
 i hate the fact that hazel grace took the words right out of my mouth when she said what she said about being a vegetarian... 
 ""i want to minimise the number of deaths i am responsible for,"" 
 and about not knowing what's cool... 
 ""i take a lot of pride in not knowing what's cool."" 
 i hate the fact that i fell in love with this blue-eyed boy who drove horrifically and his cheesy and yet very endearing attempts to be prince charming....(but more so with him...the surprised, excited and innocent side of him..) 
 ""may i see you again?"" he asked. there was an endearing nervousness in his voice. 
 i smiled. ""sure."" 
 ""tomorrow?"" he asked. 
 ""patience, grasshopper,"" i counseled. ""you don't want to seem overeager."" 
 ""right, that's why i said tomorrow,"" he said. ""i want to see you again tonight. but i'm willing to wait all night and much of tomorrow."" 
 i hate the fact that hazel grace felt like a grenade and all she wanted to do was minimise the casualities when (not if but when) she blew up... 
 i hate the fact that i felt sorry for a lonely swing set...a desperately lonely swing set which needed a loving home...or maybe it was simply a lonely, vaguely pedophilic swing set which sought the butts of children...and the fact that i absolutely love this sentence.... 
 the lonely swing set... 
 or maybe just vaguely pedophilic... 
 and even though i fell in love the way you fall from a cliff or a building, (don't really know how that feels..since i've never done that)..i hate the way she fell in love... 
 i hate this kiss....because for who so firm that cannot be seduced? 
 and then we were kissing. my hand let go of the oxygen cart and i reached up for his neck, and he pulled me up by my waist onto my tiptoes. as his parted lips met mine, i started to feel breathless in a new and fascinating way. the space around us evaporated, and for a weird moment i really liked my body; this cancer-ruined thing i'd spent years dragging around suddenly seemed worth the struggle, worth the chest tubes and the picc lines and the ceaseless bodily betrayal of the tumors. 
 i hate the love letter she wrote him...(spoiler alert: it's a venn diagram love letter.) 
 i hate the fact that she did not agree with maslow's hierarchy of needs (in which abraham maslow, an american psychologist, claimed that certain needs must be met before you can even have other kinds of needs.) something like this... 
 unless and until your needs of the previous level have been fulfilled, you don't even think about the needs of the next level. of course, like all psychological theories this one too cannot be generalized or accepted universally. because if there is one law in psychology then it is that there is no law in psychology, there is no given universal laws for human behaviour or thoughts or anything. every theory has it's use and flaws, applicable to some while not applicable to others. and this one is not applicable in this situation. nope, not at all. 
 i hate the words, the word play in this book... 
 a quantum entanglement of tubes and bodies....triumphantly digitized contemporaneity.... 
 i hate the fact that it made me laugh so much, smile a lot, fall in love so hard only to exact revenge later on for giving in to the false security of humour and love by making me cry....oh god, cry so much....so much... 
 because that's the thing about pain, it demands to be felt. 
 i get it...totally get it... 
 i hate the fact that i ever read this sentence... 
 ""i lit up like a christmas tree, hazel grace..."" 
 . 
 i hate it, i really hate it (forget metaphorical resonances, forget symbolism, i actually hate it). 
 i hate the fact that it made me cry so much that the lovers of-god-knows-which-century entwined on my pillowcase were drenched in the torrent of my tears and were probably ruing the fact that there was no umbrella during their time. 
 i hate the fact that i stayed up whole night reading this book, half of the night crying, and even after finishing it i couldn't go to sleep, so the rest of the dawn just pacing in my room with all these haphazard, desultory stars jumping around in my mind finding absolutely no avenue to become constellations.....and my eyes puffy (note to self: do not stay up all night or add crying to it if you do to avoid puffy eyes.) 
 why do i do this to myself?? 
 and i absolutely hate this... 
 i hate that this story is stunningly overwhelming, insightful, irreverent, raw and devastating...and to quote markus zusak, it's the kind of story reading which ""you laugh, you cry and then you come back for more."" 
 some infinities are bigger than other infinities... 
 ...i'm grateful for having known this little infinity...grateful for this epic love story of two star crossed lovers.... 
 [image error] 
 i like my choices. i hope you like yours. 
 and by hate you know i meant love, right? 
 i love this book. 
 right now, my thoughts are too jumbled up... this was amazing! it was exactly what i wanted from a series finale--epic, intense, emotional, and satisfying! just like with the previous books, i loved the world, the characters, the story, and the writing. this is one of my favorite series of all time, and i'm so so happy with this beautiful conclusion! 
 if you like sci-fi, fairy tale retellings, or you just want to read an epic & satisfying series--you need the lunar chronicles in your life! just. i cant. yes. this book. bless this book!!!!! that ending. damn. i can't even type in complete sentences after reading glass sword (even though i just did)..... if you've experienced that first love - that heart-wringing, soul-squeezing, crush-the-air-out-of-your-lungs-whenever-you're-apart first love - this book will bitch slap your feels all to hell. 
 i love it. i love its warmth and its vibrancy, its heartache and its pain, its humor, its meanness, the ugliness, the beauty, the crying, the laughter, the sarcasm. i love eleanor and i love park, and i love that there's still a tiny chance for them...and for everyone whose first love was torn away. even if you never see that person again, they change you in ways that no one else will ever understand. they will always, always hold that little piece of your heart that no one else will ever be able to touch. 
 i love you, rainbow rowell, for giving me this. thank you. let's play a little game of: 
 who am i... 
 -my book starts with me moving to a new location and starting at a new school. 
 -i live with just my dad, but don't worry about him, he's not important. in fact, you'll barely notice he exists at all! 
 -i quickly make friends at my new school. i'm not sure why everyone likes me. i'm not remotely interesting. 
 -i've never had a boyfriend before meeting my love interest and for some reason people at my school find that hard to believe. 
 -as soon as my love interest catches my eye, i can't get him out of my mind. he's the mysterious type, but he only has eyes for me. he quickly becomes my boyfriend and we fall deeply in love. *swoon* 
 -my boyfriend happens to have a sibling who simply adores me. how could she not, i'm so awesome! she has a super special sight too. p.s. her name starts with an ""a."" 
 -my b-b-boyfriend---sorry that was me swooning again; he's so super howt *giggle*---also has another sibling that doesn't seem to like me at first. they are always glaring at me! it unnerves me. but i can get through anything with my boy toy by my side! oh, and p.s. their name starts with an ""r."" 
 -my boyfriend just happens to save my life with his mysterious powers. at first when i confront him about it, he plays it off. it really upsets me. it just wasn't fair!!! 
 -he later tells me that he can't stay away from me any longer and soon after he takes me to his home to really introduce me to his family. 
 -i find out he's been stalking me for a while. but it doesn't bother me. i find it incredibly romantic. 
 -*psst*, if my boyfriend and i were to have a baby, it would be some strange half-breed child. 
 -randomly out of nowhere i'm kidnapped by a tracker. i'm not sure where he came from because this book is all about me and my one true love. 
 -when i'm not hanging out with my boyfriend or getting abducted, i can be found brushing my teeth, eating cereal, doing homework or cooking for my dad. oh, and i hate being the center of attention. i'm so selfless. 
 -by the end of my book, i end up in the hospital. 
 so....who am i? 
 if you guessed bella swan you are correct! but if you guessed megan rosenberg, you are also correct! don't bother looking up to the top of the screen. this is indeed a carrier of the mark review or as i like to call it twilight 2.0 or better yet, carrier of the twilight or twi-remix or twilight goes to ireland or, or, or...okay you get the picture. and no, i'm not kidding all the above actually happens in this book. 
 i feel like i need to start saying how sorry i am to leigh fallon. truly, i am. you see, i'm in the middle of re-reading the twilight series and as a result, i am hyperaware of the twi-likeness this book has. i was really eager to get my hands on carrier of the mark, but you have no idea how disappointed i am in this book. so, it is with a heavy heart that i review twilight carrier of the mark again. 
 seventeen-year-old bella swan megan rosenberg moves to forks ireland after her dad, charlie caleb, accepts and new position at a yacht club. on her first day at school she notices a mysterious boy, named edward cullen adam deris, staring at her. she literally cannot stop thinking about him for the rest of the book. i'm not going to retell the book here, but if you've read twilight just sprinkle on a little air bender, add a pinch of captain planet, and toss a creepy baby on top and you pretty much have the recipe for carrier of the mark. instead, i'm going to be pulling a few select quotes with commentary pour moi. 
 adam randomly confesses his feelings to megan after have several staring contests: 
 they told me from the very beginning that it wasn't safe to 'consort,'"" he said, slightly wincing at the word, ""with you. but i'm not strong enough to stay away."" 
 now where have i heard that before? 
 twilight: 
 he heard the change in my tone. his eyes tightened. ""i don't seem to be strong enough to stay away from you..."" 
 a little pda action: 
 i put my hand on adam's face and felt along his cheek and down along his jaw, reveling in the softness of his skin in comparison to the light stubble. he closed his eyes. 
 ""you have no idea how good that feels,"" he murmured. 
 that sounds so familiar... 
 twilight: 
 ""do you mind?"" i asked, for he had closed his eyes again. 
 ""no,"" he said without opening his eyes. ""you can't imagine how that feels."" he sighed. 
 i lightly trailed my hand over the perfect muscles of his arm, followed the faint pattern of bluish veins inside the crease at his elbow. 
 rosalie rian doesn't like megan at first: 
 ""rian has a tough time accepting who we are and our purpose...i think he's just finding it hard to accept that you would opt in when you have the chance to walk away."" 
 now, who had the same issue? 
 twilight: 
 he sighed deeply. ""rosalie struggles the most with... with what we are. it's hard for her to have someone on the outside know the truth. and she's a little jealous...you're human."" he shrugged. ""she wishes that she were, too."" 
 there is a tracker following megan: 
 it's been years since we have even seen a tracker in ireland."" 
 ""is that what the guy in the theater was? a tracker?"" 
 ""i think so. we can't be sure at the moment, but he fits the usual profile. there's something different this time, though; he's getting around our defenses. we just don't know how he's doing it."" 
 funny that's just who was following bella too. 
 twilight: 
 ""he's a tracker, alice, did you see that? he's a tracker!"" 
 love interest serching for a way to protect heroine from the tracker: 
 ""don't apologize. i hate to see you hurting like that. please believe me when i tell you that i will make you safe."" 
 didn't edward promise the same thing in a very similar situation? 
 twilight: 
 ""soon, as soon as i possibly can. i will make you safe first."" his voice was hard. 
 a bad guy was snooping around megan's room and house. adam has his family guarding her, but somehow they manage to slip through: 
 ""someone was in her room, for christ's sake. in her room!"" 
 ""but i don't think he was still there when megan got home. if he had been, he would have acted right then and there. i'd say her mark was sensing that he'd been there earlier."" 
 rian shook his head. ""how is he getting around our senses? we've always known when the knox are close. this is bad."" 
 can't seem to put my finger on it..oh wait, i can. 
 twilight (eclipse): 
 ""he was in her room, alice. he could have still been there -- waiting for her."" 
 ""i would have seen that."" 
 edward threw his hands up in exasperation. ""really? you're sure?"" alice's voice was cold when she answered. ""you've already got me watching the volturis' decisions, watching for victoria's return, watching bella's every step. you want to add another? do i just have to watch charlie, or bella's room, or the house, or the whole street, too? edward, if i try to do too much, things are going to start slipping through the cracks."" 
 shitdamn 
 oh, but the similarities don't end there. right after adam reveals his feelings to megan, the very next day he takes her to meet his family. and if you remember that is exactly what edward did after he revealed all his feelings to bella in the meadow scene (confessions, chapter 13). aine alice, adam's sister also has a ""sight."" fionn carlisle is adam's adoptive father. adam admitted to stalking megan just like edward did to bella. megan confides in her best friend, caitlin, in math class. what do you know? that's the same place bella confided with jessica at. both adam and edward's eyes change color (interestingly, both share the same original color: green). 
 i just couldn't get past all the twilight references. i'm honestly baffled at how this book got published with all the shocking similarities because carrier of the mark reads just like a twilight fan-fic and not a good one. i'd give this book a freakin' ""a+"" for following the ""twilight book disaster"" recipe to the t, but an all around ""f"" (fail) for ya literature. i went though several different emotions while reading this book: shock, disbelief, finally settling on anger. anger? yes. did the author sit with her editor over tea and crumpets with their twilight copies on their laps pulling plots, quotes, and carbon copies of the characters? did they really think no one would pick up on the similarities?! well, i'll tell you something. my twilight copy is open on my lap right now and i am not amused one bit. this is something i expect from the usual offender cassie clare, not a debut ya author. and, man, i feel so bad writing this review. i absolutely hate giving a 1 star review to debut authors, but wow. i'm just blown this even saw the light of day. 
 and what's a twi-fan-fic without insta-love? this book has plenty of that and co-dependency. keep in mind they have been dating for 2 weeks. let me count the ways: 
 ""i feel like i could take on the world when i'm with you."" 
 i felt a new confidence building. i could take on the world with him by my side. 
 this felt so real. it seemed like my future was suddenly very clear. i had a whole new purpose--and it all revolved around this boy by my side. 
 everything else paled in significance. i could not live without him. as much as it upset me to hurt the others, it was nothing compared to the stabbing pain i felt when i thought of being parted from him. 
 and the more time that went by, the more i realized i could not live without adam. 
 wtf. i'm so tired of co-dependent relationships! is it a wonder why young girls think they need a boyfriend to survive? are these the ideals we want our youth to grow up learning? i don't take issue with megan being in love, but reading the statements above disturbs me. the entire book revolves around how in love she is with adam, so don't expect much of a plot in this book. the major conflict in the story comes out of nowhere and ends before it even begins, just as it did in twilight. 
 and, omg the mythology. it will make your head spin. we learn most of the world through god awful info-dumps. i read those pages over a few times and i still don't understand. perhaps if the author showed the reader instead of telling us, maybe i would have been able to keep up. the only thing i think i understood was that megan is carrier of a specific gene that would enable her to produce children to bear the mark. since carrier's are rare the order (a society that ""looks after"" the marked) specially selects the carrier's mates. i suppose being gay is out if you are a carrier, because you have a duty to produce babies! anyway, apparently it is forbidden for adam and megan to be together because if they have a child it could destroy the world. yeah...i don't get it either. once finding that out, megan decides she doesn't want to be a marked one anymore and help save the world. she wants to be with her romeo. 'cause being in love is more important than the safety of the world, donchaknow. and, please don't get me started on the whole 25-year-old pregnancy. i can't even. 
 fallon, you had all this potential. the setting was perfect: ireland! and you wasted your descriptions on megan eating her wheaties and putting on her red converses? *points to face* this is me not giving two shits. 
 cait, babe, you were right. 
 i'll leave you with a definition from webster: 
 o*rig*i*nal

 /end rant \(-_-)/ 
 more reviews and more at cuddlebuggery book blog. probably my favorite book of 2015, didn't want it to end so i made it last as long as possible! i am still #teammaven. scroll down to the spoiler portion of my review to read my theory on his redemption arc. i'm either right or dead wrong, but my gut is telling me to there is more to maven than meets the eye. 
 ""mare, i am very afraid for you. things have been done to you, things no person should suffer. you've seen horrible things, done horrible things, and they will change you. i'm so afraid for what you could be, if given the wrong chance."" 
 enter the world of shades of gray. no character will be spared. 
 i finished. and i have many, many thoughts. let me try to get them down coherently in gif's (find my review of red queen here): 
 1. first 50% i was mostly bored. >>not that the writing wasn't amazing, because it was, or because there wasn't action, because there was, but because there was little romance and no maven and no palace and i just wasn't as entertained as the first book. but that all changed the second half when things got good... 
 2. a certain someone's death hit me harder than expected. 
 >> i didn't like this person at all in the first book, and now i'm thinking i should read one of the novellas to get more of this character. 
 3. i really loved mare in this book. 
 >>i'm sure some reviews will say she was moping and angry but honestly she was real. mare struggled to make the right decisions and be who they wanted her to be and she was haunted by the events of book one. (again, this series reminds me a lot of mockingjay-katniss feels, but for me that's a wonderful thing because i loved hunger games and would gladly read scenes like that over and over. i got why it was so hard of her to let go of protecting killorn and move into some sort of friendship with cal. i liked that she didn't know how to interact with the children and people kept looking at her like she was a traitor to both red and silver. i liked the way she kept the notes from maven and the way she and cal still mourned the boy they thought they had known. 
 4. the ending. oh dear lawd that ending. now that was an ending. 
 his expression is unreadable, but his meaning is clear. with one hand, he points at his feet. his fingers whiter than i remember. 
 i do as he says. 
 i kneel. 
 >> read below to understand my thoughts (everything is marked as a spoiler fyi): 
 that ending with maven. i sensed it coming but it was just as epic as i hoped. i felt less chemistry between mare and cal in this book (even though i'm #teammaven i still loved cal in the first) and while i could be dead wrong, here is what i think: 
 victoria is setting us up for a warner-esque (of tahereh mafi's shatter me) love story between mare and maven. i know it makes no sense -he committed countless unexcusable crimes (a la darkling and warner)- but do we know for sure that was him? do we really? did we see him actually hurt anyone in this book? no. okay, well technically, he did hurt mare with that branding thing but.... gah. i just feel like there is some sort of explanation. maybe somehow it protects her? i dunno. i just know there is more to the story. and all of the bad things that did happen, cersei -excuse me, elara, was still alive and well. and do we know why she was in the prison? do we really understand what was happening during that prison break out? why was her hair graying and her appearance worn? i tell you why: because there is more to this whole ""maven is evil"" business than meets the eye. i am getting very strong juliette (of shatter me) vibes where mare is going to start to understand or find out more about maven in the next book and help him struggle to redeem himself by the end of the series. i am wishing for a hea between m&m but most likely i think she will help save him from himself and end up with cal or alone. maven is not pure evil and i don't think he is the villain the way we think he is. i think there are other factors at play that will be revealed -like how we thought warner was pure evil in shatter me only to find his actions explained away in the sequels. 
 ""no one is born a monster."" but i wish some people were. it would make it easier to hate them, to kill them, to forget their dead faces. ""even maven."" i'm sorry but quotes like that hint at my suspicions so well. shades of gray, people, shades of gray. 
 >>now maybe you can think this is just wishful thinking. your reaction to my prediction is probably this: 
 and you can throw a hundred things maven did in my face and tell me i can't explain all of that away. 
 there are people who read shatter me who refused to forgive warner. i realize rooting for maven is crazy to a rational eye, but in books i tend to love and sympathize with the villain and i'm sorry but reading that ending where mare has given herself over to maven in exchange for everyone's freedom... i just know there is so much potential there. 
 maybe i'm wrong and he really is a psychopath. but i got chills with that ending and it was because of what we might see in the next book. i'm sorry but i'm just not getting an epic love story for cal & mare, i think she is going to fall for maven & try to save him from himself in the next two books. i could be dead wrong and i realize i sound crazy, but i'm telling you, i think there is more to maven than the villain victoria has been leading us to believe. she's a master at twists and i am telling you that i think maven is her trump card. i think maven is end game for this series and i do not think he is pure evil even though we've only been offered evidence of the contrary. i'm calling it and if i'm wrong, well maybe i am, but my author instincts are telling me there is more than black and white, evil and good. this series is going to be about shades of gray. 
 final notes: why oh why did i have to wait a whole book to get two scenes with maven? i know why. because victoria is an evil genius and knows she is torturing us but it's exactly what we need to get amped up for the third book (there's four planned now, right?). glass sword did have second-book syndrome -it was building to future events and showing us character development and it was absolutely getting us to see how this world truly functioned, but it was truly necessary for the stage victoria is planning to set. we all saw what she was capable in red queen, and i have faith the next two books will be a non-stop rollercoaster of madness now that she has given us all the building blocks and endeared us to all of the characters (i see what you did there!) so that she can let blood fly in the next. did i love this book more than red queen? no. but i think victoria did an excellent job preparing us for what's to come and building the world none of us really got to see in the first book. eta: i just did my final, final read-through of this book, and i have to say, it was a messy road, and a long revision, but i am really freaking proud of the result. 
 eta: it has a cover!! 
 sin city plus romeo and juliet minus romance plus monsters. 
 this is the strangest book i've ever written. i love it. 
 it's the story of two teens in a broken world, where violent acts breed actual monsters. some are shadows with teeth that feed on flesh and bone. some are corpses that feed on blood. and some can pass for human. those feed on souls. 
 it's the story of kate harker, the only daughter of a crime boss, and august flynn, the son of a man trying to hold his city together. she's a human who wants to be a monster, and he's a monster who wishes he were human. 
 it's dark, and violent, and existential, and the whole thing was inspired by a line from vicious: 
 ""plenty of humans were monstrous, and plenty of monsters knew how to play at being human."" 
 8.3.15: edited to add: and the official title is...this savage song. why song? 
 remember when i said that august was a monster? he's not just any kind of monster, but one of only three soul-eaters in the city. and these rare creatures (he wouldn't like that word) use music to bring the souls of their prey to surface. 
 but it's more than that. this book isn't a solo. it's a duet. a song played by two very different teens trying to survive a very broken world. there are moments of discord, and a few of harmony, and through it all, they have to keep the melody alive. omg 
 this 
 book 
 has 
 changed 
 me suffice to say, apollo, you are awesome. this book made me literally ""lol"" multiple times and brought a smile to my face seeing old characters i love again. yay! 
 ill be uploading my review to my youtube channel this week! wow that was a great ending to this very fantastical series! i cannot wait to go into more detail in my series review which will be out probably next week. i'll be covering my opinions on all 5 books and then my overall opinion of the series. i am so happy i finally read pjo! this was a ""dam"" good series (lol get it? ""dam"") ok finally i can talk about this book. 
 before i get into it i want to say i learned a big lesson when it comes to sponsored reviews. i was approached to do a sponsored review of this book and at the time my only thoughts were ""hell yeah"" 
 i was planning on reading the book anyways so why not be paid. the contract i had to sign seemed pretty simple, don't spoil things in the book and don't give the book to anyone. then i read the book. i contacted harper letting them know that my review would not be favorable and i would be raising concerns i had over what i viewed as racist stereotypes. then i heard nothing back....for weeks. until about 3 weeks later i got an email saying my sponsorship had been dissolved and that per my contract i could not talk about the book until it's release. which is now, so you better believe i have thoughts. 
 *i want to make a note here because some people are confused. this was not standard practice for a sponsored review. i have never seen or heard of a publisher dissolving a partnership with a booktuber because they didn't like the review. which is why i am still very shocked this happened.* 
 but now instead of telling you why this book is racist, as there are better voices, i will direct you to justina ireland who has spoken out about this book - 
 http://justinaireland.com/dammit-this... 
 what i want to address is the ableism. recently veronica roth did an interview with npr where they discussed how the current gifts in ctm were inspired by chronic pain. the interviewer says that chronic pain can be a gift, to which roth agrees and goes on to say that part of the book is cyra figuring out why her and others are worthy of pain. 
 http://www.npr.org/templates/transcri... 
 * note that roth has said she herself has chronic pain* 
 this to me was so upsetting. i have lived with chronic pain now for 7 years. it is something that has taken over my life and caused a lot of harm. some days it is so bad i can barely sit up, let alone get out of bed. and to see someone equate it with a gift or say people are worthy of it makes me feel sick. whether or not roth has chronic pain herself, i am not one to say she is lying, that does not take away the harm. it is not a magical shield to be pulled out when you've hurt people. 
 twitter threads re: chronic pain

 at this point i don't even care to do a real review of this book. i want to put it behind me and never touch on it again. should i break out in song and dance to ""baa, baa, black sheep?"" one lonely star. i'm just as surprised as you are, considering i just knew going into eleanor & park that i would love it, love it, love it. what reason would i have to believe otherwise? almost all of my friends loved this book and have sworn fealty to the goddess of feels and might, rainbow rowell. and i get it because she is a pretty awesome person and i think she is totally lovely. so trust me when i say i really wanted to love this book. in fact, i am blindsided that i didn't, saddened that i can't join the eleanor & park kool kidz fan club and disappointed at such a disjointed reading experience. 
 random reasons why i didn't like this book: 
 1. the romance 
 my main issue stems from the romance between eleanor and park. i just... didn't get it. though, that's not for lack of trying because i had many arguments with adult me and teen me in my brain. teen me remembers the infatuation of meeting someone exciting and experiencing all those special moments for the first time. however, with eleanor and park, it was entirely unrealistic and unbelievable. 
 park went from ""god! just sit the fuck down, eleanor!"" to ""god, she has incredibly soft hands."" 
 eleanor went from ""that stupid asian kid"" to ""he's so pretty. i love his hair! i want to eat his face!"" 
 the next thing i know, park is telling eleanor that he's in love with her, how he can't imagine being without her, that she's it for him. then eleanor is telling him she doesn't breathe when she's away from him. adult me was not on board because the romance moved entirely too swiftly for my feelings to catch up with the events that were taking place. no, i take that back. ""swiftly"" would indicated that there was some sort of actual pacing involved, but that was absent. one day they disliked each other and the next they were holding hands and proclaiming their love. 
 i remember listening to that part while i was out on a morning run, and i had to stop and rewind because i legitimately thought i missed an entire chapter. but then i realized that i hadn't and i argued with myself. 
 adult me: *twitch* 
 teen me: yeah, but remember when you thought you were in love with that guy and how you were going to marry him? 
 adult me: yes... 
 teen me: so obviously they're not going to be together forever and ever and gallop into the sunset, but you can't discount those feelings. 
 adult me: *gumbles* i know that. but i also never wanted to eat a guy's face... 
 teen me: please don't tell me i grow up without a heart. 
 adult me: ... 
 2. the historical background 
 eleanor & park takes place in omaha, 1986, where there's racial tension. park is half white and half korean. he spends most of his time trying not to be noticed by other kids at school and struggling with his own insecurities over his mixed heritage. yet, oddly, throughout the entire novel, park doesn't encounter any racism. apart from a few brief monologuing sessions about his classmates thinking he was chinese, eleanor's off-hand ""stupid asian kid"" remarks and park's own dislike for, in his opinion, looking too feminine, there wasn't anything that felt accurate. 
 park's character had so much more potential that was not utilized. i was hoping for something more from his development regarding how he viewed himself and his mother. perhaps a certain level of acceptance or resolve would have been appropriate. 
 there were also two black girls who befriend eleanor, but even they don't seem to face any racism in this predominately white neighborhood. it was like rowell deliberately tip-toed around them and instead threw in a reference to the community being offended by a black boy getting a white girl pregnant. strangely, the only one who seemed to get picked on was eleanor. i do think it's awesome that this novel had diversity, something that is sorely missing in ya, but i wasn't buying what rowell was selling. 
 at the same time, rowell never let you forget that this book was set in the 80s since eleanor & park is overloaded with pop culture references on almost every other page. (i admit to chuckling to the 867-5309 reference.) still, we also never forgot park was asian with eleanor constantly referencing it in her narration to the point that i started feeling uncomfortable. 
 3. the narration 
 i wasn't a huge fan of the back and forth narrative and found that it annoyed me more than anything. this is where i wonder if my rating is more an indication of how i felt about the audio vs. the actual story. i disliked both of the narrator's voices. the parts of eleanor's dialogue that was ""snarky"" wasn't portrayed with the right kind of emotion. park's narration was slightly better, but the narrator, sunil malhotra, bored me to tears with his monotone reading and unbelievable voice for eleanor. 
 4. the story 
 i'll be honest and admit that it's possible that i didn't ""get"" this book. it may have just gone way over my head. why? rowell tried to cram a lot of story and situations into one little book and it didn't work for me. before going into eleanor & park i was told that the ending was heartbreaking, but i didn't feel that at all. rowell relies on eleanor's grim family life to spark sympathies from readers and i can see how this works and why it's marketed to john green fans. however, the ending relies on your connection to their romance to feel the heartbreak. the problem with that was, by the end, i wanted to know what became of eleanor's mom and siblings, but the focus was instead on her feelings for park and letting him go. eleanor spent a good amount of the story in this terrible environment, feeling these feelings and when i genuinely wanted to know her feelings about everything, all i get is a freaking post card and the book ends. since the romance was doing absolutely nothing for me, i needed for the plot to come in and rescue this book. it did not. 
 i'm not saying this was a terrible book. not by a long shot. it's clear that this story has touched a lot of people and i wouldn't go as far to not recommend it, but i also think this is a bit overhyped. i went in with really high expectations, thinking i was going to be blown into next week by the awesome. instead, i'm walking away with feelings brewing a special pot of ""meh."" 
 even still, i'm holding out hope for fangirl... 
 more reviews and other fantastical things at cuddlebuggery book blog. so good. 
 so freaking good. 
 not just good but great. 
 gahhhhhhhhh 
 p.e.r.f.e.c.t.i.o.n 
 i read queen of shadows back in june but could not say anything about it (not even that i had it!). but now i can and let me tell you, sarah has done it again! i loved qos, so beautiful, bloody and outstanding. oh and...rowan...swoon!!! 
 5/5 stars of course! no stars. 
 disclaimer: i read to about 65%. skim read to about 90% and read to the end. also, this review will contain spoilers for the alternate ending that are not in spoiler tags. 
 years ago, when twilight was in its prime, someone told me that breaking dawn was never supposed to happen. that it was the book where stephenie meyer was given free reign to do whatever she wanted because the series was so popular, everyone would buy it regardless of quality, and rake in big dough-cheese for her and her publishers. i don't really know how true that assumption is, but dammit if isn't true for life and death. 
 take me for example: i own all of the twilight books, have read twilight (just the first book) a total of 4 times, 5 if you include this (and i do), written about some of the good that came of the series (i'm not always a fire-breathing bitch queen), made fun of it, enjoyed parts of it, loathed chucks of it and everything else in between. i also attempted to re-read the series back in 2012 for this little thing i started called project: hindsight, and had so much fun reviewing midnight sun (i really wish she'd finish that), but by the time i got to new moon (the book i dislike the most), i just couldn't continue on and abandoned the project. 
 over the past few years, i've settled on generally disliking everything twilight stands for while holding onto a morbid fascination and, begrudgingly, bestowing some sort of respect for a series that put ya literature on the map. 
 so when i heard of life and death, literally the day it released, i knew i'd buy it. no questions asked. i was hoping many of the issues i had with twilight would be corrected with this version. it had so much potential to be great! i never expected there to be huge drastic changes to the story -- i did expect it to be pretty much the same as twilight, so believe me when i say that was the least of its problems. 
 i won't bother reviewing this book, because it's essentially the same as twilight and i've already written a review for that. just swap around the pronouns in your head as you read it. 
 in the forward, stephenie meyer opens with this: 
 ""but i've always maintained that it would have made no difference if the human were male and the vampire female-- it's still the same story. gender and species aside, twilight has always been a story about the magic and obsession and frenzy of first love."" 
 i don't think she was very successful. there were times when i wondered what meyer was truly trying to accomplish here. was she trying to basically say her novel features an unhealthy relationship even with roles reversed? as in, ""hey guys, my book is horrible either way!"" or was her goal to further highlight how twilight had a lot of instances of sexism, including sexual violence against women? because if so, then i suppose, yeah, she was successful. 
 here's a general run down: beau is your classic gary stu who falls for the ultimate manic pixie dream girl, edythe. he has no aspirations to do or be anything until he spots the love of his life in his high school cafeteria. not much has changed with our young, desperate lovers except for their pronouns, but edythe is still a jerk/control freak/stalker and somehow less creepy than edward. and beau is still a very weak character and as interesting as the dirt beneath my shoe. there is an alternate ending which is essentially a pathetic attempt to pack new moon and eclipse into a clusterfuck of info-dumping. but more on that later. 
 what i really want to talk about is the treatment of the female characters. 
 i don't know how this was even possible, but reading life and death actually made me hate twilight even more than i originally did. this is mostly because it became shockingly evident that certain scenes (sexual assault) were purposefully left out in this version because the characters didn't have vaginas. lovely. 
 bella's attempted rape scene has now turned into beau's assault scene. if you remember, in twilight, while bella is getting lost in port angeles, she runs into a group of drunk men who attempt to sexually assault her. this is made clear by their jeers (""don't be like that, sugar."") and edward's later dialogue. but for beau, his assailants are a mix between female and male and have the intention of beating him up because they think he is a cop. the section is entirely re-written with more dialogue, a gun and threats of death. 
 then there is rosalie's rape scene, now changed to royal's assault scene. instead of royal being raped, he's tricked during the wedding and beat up within an inch of his life. now, one could argue the time period and say, ""well, that's happened back then. it's just how things were."" and, maybe, before i read life and death i could have seen that point. but when the two biggest instances of female sexual assault are completely left out when you swap the genders, oy, that's an issue. 
 now that is not to say i wanted to see men get rape in life and death. it's just a glaring problem where i now see those scenes as ""literary rape,"" used as plot devices to add depth and sympathy to rosalie's character, and to give edward a reason to look super heroic in the face of rapists. maggie stiefvater said it best in this is a post about literary rape: 
 ""i'm talking about novels where the rape scene could just as easily be any other sort of violent scene and it only becomes about sex because there's a woman involved. if the genders were swapped, a rape scene wouldn't have happened. the author would've come up with a different sort of scenario/ backstory/ defining moment for a male character."" 
 that is exactly what happened here. 
 one could argue that meyer wrote a more progressive version of twilight with life and death and that's partly true to an extent. edythe does appear to try to make her relationship with beau as equal as possible. but there are constant references to the gender changes as if meyer is trying to prove something to the reader, and they only seemed to further resign me to the fact that meyer has no idea what she's doing. (bold is mine.) 
 his straight gold hair was wound into a bun on the back of his head, but there was nothing feminine about it-- somehow it made him look even more like a man. 
 i fumbled for my wallet. 
 ""um, let me-- you didn't even get anything--"" 
 ""my treat, beau."" ""but--"" 
 ""try not to get caught up in antiquated gender roles."" 
 she turned toward the cafeteria, swinging her bag into place. 
 ""hey, let me get that for you,"" i offered. 
 she looked up at me with doe eyes. ""does it look too heavy for me?"" 
 ""well, i mean..."" 
 ""sure,"" she said. she slid the bag down her arm and then held it out to me, very deliberately using just the tip of her pinkie finger. 
 it was like meyer was shouting me, ""do i impress you?!"" and i kept going: 
 in the hands of a more skilled writer, this might have been pulled off flawlessly. i found the changes she made with beau's narration interesting. meyer mentioned in the forward that bella is more flowery with her words, where beau is not. this is a complete understatement. the one thing twilight actually had going for it, was the occasionally pretty quote. i say occasional, because the novel contains too many short, simple sentences than i usually like in my books. in life and death's case, the writing has been watered down so much that it feels on par with see spot run. and i don't necessarily think this is a gender thing. just because a character is a boy, doesn't mean he can't be articulate or well-versed. 
 ""bonnie, there's something you didn't know about me.... i used to smell really good to vampires."" 
 corny. so very corny. 
 it's not uncommon to discover popular ya authors' inability to write convincing male povs. *cough*veronica roth*cough* and i learned from midnight sun, that it's not exactly meyer's forte either, but c'mon! this was really bad, even for her. 
 the there's beau's obsession with edythe's unhealthy* body. oh, god, i'm so disgusted with this part, and i don't really understand why it was included. 
 ""her pale arms, her slim shoulders, the fragile-looking twigs of her collarbones, the vulnerable hollows above them, the swanlike column of her neck, the gentle swell of her breasts-- don't stare, don't stare-- and the ribs i could nearly count under the thin cotton. she was too perfect, i realized with a crushing wave of despair. there was no way this goddess could ever belong with me."" 
 is this supposed to show beau's unrealistic expectations of women's bodies? that only vampires can achieve this level of ""perfection"" that society constantly forces on us? because there is no other explanation that works well here and i'm really trying to give meyer the benefit of the doubt and throw her a bone. the issue with this theory is, there's no indication in the book that this is an unrealistic view. actually quite the opposite happens later in that same scene: 
 i had a new definition of beauty. 
 sigh. i don't think i need to go into why this is problematic, so i'll just leave that there for your critique. 
 *unhealthy, as in for majority of women, this is an unattainable beauty standard. apologies if that came off as body shaming women/girls where that is their healthy. i'm speaking specifically about society's constant pressure on women and girls to be as thin as possible, many times to the detriment of their physical and emotional health. when beau describes edythe, he focuses so heavily on the sharp angles of her bones and it perpetuates the idea that these characteristics make her more beautiful than others. i find these descriptions irresponsible and feel there could have been a better way to describe her. 
 so let's talk about the ending. this part will have spoilers beyond this point. this is your one and only warning. 
 yes, it's re-written -- horribly, if i'm being honest. during the scene with the ballet studio (which, btw, beau didn't take ballet as a kid because he's a boy. *eyeroll*), everything is pretty much similar expect for the fact that edythe can't suck out all the venom out of beau's body, leaving him only one possible future: becoming a vampire super early and living happily ever after with his bae, edythe. 
 i wouldn't have had an issue with the change if it had actually been written without the massive amounts of info-dumping. it reads like meyer decided last minute that she wanted to only do 2 chapters of the gender swap (which she mentions in the forward), realized she spent all of her deadline time on re-writing the entire book, and quickly wrote an ending hours before she emailed it to her editor. 
 she crams the werewolf history, volturi history, rules of being a vampire, and beau's human funeral altogether and it's just so goddamn messy. it also makes the insta-love look even worse because at least bella had 3 other books and a pining jacob to consider leaving edward. it was just an overall hot ass mess that seemed so out of place. this is why i said they just let meyer do whatever the hell she wants; half that stuff would have never flown with a debut novel or any novel that desired to actually be, you know, good. 
 would i recommend this and should you read it? hard to say. my first response is, ""oh, god, no. don't waste your money."" $12.99 is an unacceptable price for an ebook (thank goodness for kindle returns!). it doesn't really offer anything vital to the twilight fandom/universe and is generally a horrible piece of writing that i want to fling stones at. but then the other half of me enjoys the suffering of my fellow book lovers and is considering purchasing this as a gag joke to both of my lovely co-bloggers. because that's really all this trite, wish-fulfilling, wankfest of a re-imaginging is good for, and i really, really need to stop being so damn curious about everything. but anyway, i'm rambling when all i really want to say is... the ball's in your court now, e.l. james. i eagerly await your newest, fan fiction original book. do you remember that taylor swift song about romeo and juliet, love story? 
 it's lyrics go something like this: 
 i'm a pretty little girl who knows nothing about literature 
 so i sing a song about starcrossed lovers 
 whose only problem is that daddy doesn't approve 
 but it's all good because we get married anyway. 
 just like that cliffnote's story about romeo and juliet! 
 yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeyyyyy! 
 we have a tendency with ya literature today, to have stories with the super duper happiest of happy endings where everything works out and true love's only real complications are external difficulties, and self-esteem issues for the girl. 
 i'm trying to think of the perfect example here and because this review is full of cheap shots at easy targets i'm going to go with... 
 twilight! 
 come on down, bella and edward! 
 now, don't get me wrong. there's nothing wrong with happy endings and butterflies and rainbows and kittens. they're lovely, lovely things and in the hands of an accomplished author, they do well. there's also nothing wrong with having a relationship that's troubled by only external forces. once again, in the right hands it's fine. i'm not being a miserly old grinch here. okay, maybe a little bit, but moving on! 
 the problem is that in real life, relationships are usually impacted by internal factors. so when you base your story on perfection that can only be tainted by evil people trying to destroy your true love, and twist the story to finally reach that happily ever after, then what you sacrifice is often the very real, almost-tangible, relatable emotions that a more realistic, thoughtful storyline could bring. 
 and also, romeo and juliet is a tragedy, taylor swift. 
 thank you, kieran culkan. you're a fresh breeze amongst the stagnant world of apathetic performers. 
 now what i love about laini taylor, other than everything, is that this woman is made of fairytales. i swear she's like woven together by sweet kisses and dewdrops. she's been sung into being by blind minstrels bathed in moonlight. she's wrapped in gossamer and shrived in pure white swan feathers. you know, all that magical shit. she's that. the woman is magic and she writes magic. if anyone could take romeo and juliet, mate it with a ya paranormal romance and produce a love child that people don't want to drown at birth - then it would be laini taylor. 
 this book is powerful, emotive, heart breaking, anguishing! 
 what i'm saying...the point i'm trying to make here...the truth is... laini taylor kicked my heart in the ass. 
 and i liked it! 
 this review can also be found on my blog, cuddlebuggery book blog. wallflower (noun) 
 a shy or retiring person who remains unnoticed at social events, especially a woman without a dance partner 
 i decided to read this book not because there was going to be a movie coming out soon. 
 it one of the reasons but then again it wasn't the main one. 
 i wanted to read it because the word ""wallflower"" caught my attention. 
 i was a wallflower. 
 i was not one of those kids people notice immediately. 
 i was one of those people who blends in very well that i was no longer noticeable. 
 i was a ""nobody"". 
 i was one of those uncool kids back in high school that almost no one spoke to because i always kept to myself. 
 i was insecure. 
 i was scared that if i try to talk no one would listen. 
 actually i think i still am even though i am already working. 
 i am still a ""nobody"" here. 
 i have a couple of friends but it seems like no one really knows who i really am because i never let them find out who i really was. 
 they know my name and a couple of unimportant things but i think that's about it. 
 they don't really care about the things i like, the things that make me cry, the things that make me smile. 
 i was just another person they knew by name but never really knew at all. 
 perks of being a wallflower has to be one of the books that i could relate to. 
 it was very insightful and poignant that in most part of this book i felt like it was me writing those letters. 
 charlie (the main character) and i don't have very much in common but still i found myself relating to his situation almost all throughout the book. 
 i was not as introverted nor was i as smart as he was but there was something about how the author wrote him that you'll start to see the world through his eyes. 
 you'll see how innocent and pure his outlook was in life. 
 charlie wasn't normal and he knew it. 
 he was struggling after the death of his favorite aunt. 
 he tried his best to ""participate"" but there is still this part of him that would be locked away from everyone else. 
 charlie was a freshman and he still has a lot of things to learn. 
 hanging out with patrick and sam (who were both seniors) exposed him to a lot of things he wasn't used to (like smoking, drinking, making out those sort of stuff). 
 his letters mirrors the experience or the things we went through during his first year in high school. 
 as i was saying earlier i loved this book a lot because i related much with not only the character but with the whole story. 
 we may not be like charlie but the things he went through in high school were something almost everyone went through. 
 i didn't do drugs nor did i smoke a lot when i was in high school. 
 but some kids were motivated in doing so by peer pressure but in charlie's case i think it was more of curiosity rather than peer pressure. 
 this book showed us how a special kid like charlie would cope with being in high school and overcoming the problems he would encounter as he goes along. 
 another thing i loved about this book was how it was written. 
 though it was written back in the 90's when you read it, you'll get this impression that it was just written recently in a 90's setting. 
 this book was transcend time. 
 when you read it probably in the next 10 years you would still be able to relate to it. 
 there were a lot of good quotations in this book but one really stood out for me: 
 so, i guess we are who we are for a lot of reasons. and maybe we'll never know most of them. but even if we don't have the power to choose where we come from, we can still choose where we go from there. we can still do things. and we can try to feel okay about them. 
 we are all different. 
 we are also all the same. 
 most of us may not be as smart as charlie or as popular as brad (who i think was an a**hole) but all of us can still make a difference. 
 we may be experiencing troubles right now but that could change based on the decisions or choices that we would make. 
 i don't think this is much of a review but more of a rant. 
 sorry my dear readers if this review disappointed you but i kind of like sharing my thoughts about a book that i really connected with. 
 this book was one of them. 
 i give this book 5 wonderful glittery stars! so allie is an orphaned teenager in a dystopian fantasy where people are enslaved by vampire masters. then she gets turned into a vampire and struggles with the morality of being a monster. 
 so at first i was like. 
 but then she was like. 
 a comparable representation on the scale of awesomeness - not a literal depiction. 
 and then i was like. 
 right away from the beginning of the novel allie was pretty ass kicking. 
 and then kanin the vampire showed up and i was like. 
 yeah, sure. whatevs. 
 but then he was like. 
 and then i was like. 
 so then allie goes trekking through the woods and i'm like. 
 and then she meets up zeke and i was like. 
 then zeke is like ewwww vampires suck and i was like. 
 then stuff with them happened and i was like. 
 so then i was worried about the writing since i'd been on the fence about the iron fey. but then kagawa did a lot of: 
 and i was like. 
 and then stephanie said the plot was slow, and i was like. 
 and then i got to the end and allie was like. 
 so i was like. 
 this review also appears on our blog, cuddlebuggery i have to mention this: my friend anna who doesn't read that much (if it's not harry potter) read ttf and called me once she finished with a wicked book hangover. 
 so proud of her! i didn't like this book. 
 this is not what i expected to be. i hoped to find a book in the style of stargirl (or something novel) and what did i find? a bunch of teens who try to ease their anxieties in their not-so-original vices and a sudden drama which leads to nonsense talking. all hiding, of course, in a couple of beautiful quotes that wrap all the 'inspiring-sites' on the internet, the reason i got to the book and i bet that you too. 
 boring, it was so so boring. 
 i didn't like the characters. alaska was unbearable (oh no wait, she was awesome if you were a character too: fantastic girl,beautiful and wonderful and ohmarrymerightnowplease, and she had to be an intelligent woman, so the author made her feminist and an avid reader, to prove she had brains), and there is no need to write about the boys because... booh. 
 the main character was a cronic linnet, who got lost in his difficulties (mostly, not having a girlfriend, such a big problem you see) and searching the great perhaps, thing he forgot to do so easily so... 
 what a waste of time! 
 2013 edit: almost four years have passed since i read and reviewed looking for alaska and i hope nobody expects me to discuss anything related to the book. it's great if you loved the book but i didn't. maybe at this time of my life i would express myself in a different way but when i wrote this i was convinced of all i said before. 
 after looking for alaska, i read other john green's books. and i loved some of them, like really did. it's sad that looking for alaska didn't work for me but i think it is wonderful that it did for you. not so many books can inspire that kind of passion :_) 
 thanks everybody for your likes and comments and my apologies for not answering them anymore. i feel empowered by that book, especially the fight scenes. so ba! this was the coolest! the unique format is what really makes this book stand out, but even without that aspect, it's still a fantastic read! going into it i didn't know a whole lot, but i'd only heard praise, and after reading it, i get it. so many awesome elements and surprises--i had no idea where the story would end up, but i loved getting there. awesome world, great characters, intense moments. it was funny and creepy, and again, just plain cool. 
 one of my faves of the year! definitely recommended, especially if you're looking for something different or you love a good sci-fi story! romantic and adorable, with a perfect balance of heart-wrenching moments. endlessly hopeful yet still grounded in reality. pretty much everything i want from a ya contemporary. i'm two for two with nicola yoon books read and loved, so there's no doubt i'll be reaching for her next novel as soon as it comes out! now with spoilery rant @ bottom! 
 hush, hush is the story of nora grey, an average high school student going about her business as usual -- until her biology teacher rearranges the class seating and places her next to the dangerous-looking new kid, patch cipriano. nora gets a weird feeling from patch, and things just keep going from bad to worse as nora becomes convinced that she is being stalked, and may even be the target of murderous intentions. add to the list nora's strange feelings about the archangel ride at the amusement park and her constant near death experiences, and well, nora's life is becoming anything but average. 
 when i finished reading hush, hush, i had to mull it over for awhile. i really wasn't sure what to say. i am absolutely enthralled by the cover (athletic looking, darkly mysterious fallen angel, contorted in mid-air in grayscale? what's not to like?). i had to have it because of that cover*. but i had a sneaking suspicion that a cover that good had to be masking something. yep. it's a bright light to dazzle the eyes and make you *ahem* overlook any faults. 
 it didn't work. 
 inside was the most confused, schizophrenic piece of writing i've read in some time. becca fitzpatrick didn't seem to know quite what she wanted, only that it had to be ominous and scary and dangerous -- and titillating, of course, and mysterious and sexy. so with those buzz words in mind, she threw a bunch of things together and let her narrator, nora, sort them out. nora, understandably, had some trouble with this, and the result is a thoroughly frustrating heroine who jumps to insane conclusions based on inane evidence one moment, and the next goes blithely along into obvious danger. 
 patch is intriguing, and perhaps the most consistent character**, and i was fully prepared for an 'anti-hero as the hero' story. i wanted a little boundary-pushing and a not entirely likeable or trustworthy male lead who may or may not redeem himself, but who gives you the dangerous and alluring in spades. for the most part, patch wasn't a let-down in this regard, and as screwed up as it is to like him, he was the stand-out character for me. (not to say i didn't have issues with him, too.) 
 but it wasn't enough. patch's bad boy antics couldn't save this book from itself. it was self-indulgent, cheesy, melodramatic in the worst sense, and confusing. i wanted to like it; i loved the fallen angel premise, the idea of an anti-hero, and bits and pieces of the writing throughout. but hush, hush suffered from too many villains and too much shock and awe, and not enough thought and follow-through. maybe fitzpatrick can pull it together for round two, and with some strong convincing by trusted, like-minded people, i may be willing to give her another chance (never gonna happen). but this was a monstrous let-down for me. you've been warned.*** 
 *we all know how that whole so-pretty-i-just-had-to thing works out. see my guest post on jo's blog about this. 
 **and by 'consistent' i mean he was consistently a douche. vee was pretty consistent too, and was a lot of fun, but she started to get annoying and a little strange... 
 ***you're still going to read it, aren't you? damn you, james porto and your beautiful, beautiful cover! 
 ***here thar be spoilers*** 
 if you haven't read hush, hush and intend to, or if you don't want me dissing the melodrama that is patch and nora, look away....now! 
 commence rant: 
 you already know i had issues with this book. i think a lot of people are going to take offense to the idea of patch as the hero, as teen girls' fantasy, just as they did with edward in twilight. patch goes beyond the simple term ""bad boy"" in that yes, he does actually mean nora harm. consistently. 
 i'm not going to go into that, because frankly, i don't care. he can be an anti-hero all he wants, whatever. if that's where the story's going, fine. most of my issues -- but not all -- lie with nora. 
 here's the thing: 
 nora is that girl you yell at in the horror movie, the idiot that goes up the stairs instead of out the door, or reaches to turn over the downed bad guy just to make sure. we all know that's frustrating, but we've come to expect it in movies, and that dumb big-breasted, scantily clad girl normally gets killed off. 
 nora is so much more frustrating than that. 
 the many sides of nora: she continually suspects patch (and elliot, and just about everyone else in this story), and with good reason. however, she then continually ignores her instincts and puts herself in danger. in fact, she can't seem to agree with herself. she will think to herself that patch is stalking her and trying to kill her, and then within pages think 'oh, but he could never hurt me.' this just cycles and cycles throughout the story. 
 also throughout the story, nora makes insane jumps in logic -- whether they turn out to be true or not, it's not believable when she immediately jumps to the most bizarre conclusions and then acts on them. at the same time, she will be directly confronted with some piece of real evidence, something that would make a normal, non-fictional person take notice and say something's not right here -- and she will completely ignore it. it's like she's being willfully obtuse. 
 examples: 
 * early(ish) in the story, nora hears a voice in her head and thinks patch has ""breached normal communication methods and could, at will, speak to me without ever opening his mouth."" naturally, she thinks she's delusional. hearing your name and a few inane comments would make one think they are imagining things, and this i could buy. even nora not being exactly sure what happened and being creeped out i could buy. but she proceeds to ask patch how he's able to speak directly to her mind, making her look like a loon. 
 i wouldn't be even all that bothered by this, if it was consistent throughout the story; if nora either consistently thought that she was going crazy because of all the implausible things that are happening, i could buy it; if she wanted to prove she wasn't crazy and kept confronting patch and sleuthing, i could buy it. it would be 1 solid choice on becca fitzpatrick's part. she could be the ultra-paranoid girl who thinks she's going crazy and jumps to conclusions about everything. annoying, but doable. but to present this as if it's normal...and i'm out. 
 * conversely, near the near the end of the story when the shit's really beginning to go down and nearly everyone has become a villain, nora and patch walk out of a movie theater to find that ""...both the tires on the driver's side were flat: '""i can't believe it!"" i said. ""i drove over two nails?""' 
 o_o 
 ??? 
 she thinks she's being stalked, she thinks her best friend has been kidnapped by a teenaged murderer named elliot, and by this point she thinks she's the target of not one but two murderous angels, and yet all she can come up with is that she ran over two nails? come on! if nora will jump to conclusions on the barest of evidence, how in hell does she not comprehend the obvious? 
 * throughout the story, nora thinks everyone's out to get her (she's right, but i'll get to that), especially patch. patch is ominous, capital 'o', and yet...and yet, no matter how much nora thinks he's badbadbad, she trusts him. why? 
 weirdest of all, when nora confronts patch about his intentions, 
 he admits he wanted to kill her 
 ; her reaction? 'i know patch could never hurt me' -- and she trusts him implicitly from that point on. really? the whole story, you've suspected him and been insistent that you should stay away on the barest of evidence, but once he's confessed his (albeit previous) intentions of murder, you trust him. 
 really 
 . her sudden bizarre trust of patch comes too late for any real belief in their romance. or her sanity. 
 there is no consistency in nora's thinking. i just can't understand why becca fitzpatrick couldn't pick one nora to write and stick with her. 
 she could have just always thought she was losing her mind; self-doubt would have been interesting, and made her root-forable. 
 if she had just been reckless and always convinced that yes, maybe something is a little off about patch, but she still found herself attracted to him, it would have been interesting, and could have been used to slowly reveal the truth and up nora's anxiety. 
 if nora had just been naive and always convinced that everything was fine despite any indicators, it would have built tension. 
 but combining it all made nora seem confused and a little off herself, and made the writing seem schizophrenic. 
 too many villains: fitzpatrick makes the rookie mistake of lack of restraint. nora suspects everyone, and everyone does in fact seem to be a villain. this makes the book seem unfocused and sort of cheesy. when everyone is under suspicion, and everyone seems to be a bad guy, it makes it seem like no one really is. it's like if you use a really great word once or twice it's going to stand out. but if every word you use is some great, unusual word, none are going to stand out. there's no negative space, no background to make the focal point pop. everywhere nora turns, someone's trying to kill her. it just gets silly after awhile. also, it has the added negative effect of making it hard for fitzpatrick to ""top"" as it were. where does she go from here? if there are 4 different people trying to kill nora in book 1, how many people will there be out for blood in book 2? she didn't leave any room to grow the suspense. 
 another bad thing about the amount of villains and nora's instant suspicion (and the overall over-the-top nature of the book) was that there was precious little suspense. by giving everything away rather freely, fitzpatrick deprived the reader of the slow build-up and the privilege of the mystery; we never got to have any suspicions of our own, or choose sides. there was too much in the way of ominous overtones, and not enough restraint. 
 on a side note, not that i'm calling vee a villain, but even she became a little weird* as the story went on. it's one thing to be the wild and crazy girl in the best friends dynamic, but constantly trying to get your best friend alone with a guy who she says makes her uncomfortable, who she believes broke into her house and may be stalking her, and who she knows was a murder suspect is reckless beyond the pale, and shitty, shitty friendship. 
 *by which i mean she goes from being quirky and funny to a godawful, shitty friend. you know, for no other reason than apparently to help lure nora into bad/ridiculous situations. plot device: 
 the writing overall: i saw glimpses in fitzpatrick's writing that demonstrated how this could have been a good book. she does sexual tension and confrontation scenes fairly well, and there is some good humor. vee -- in the beginning, at least, before she becomes a really reckless, really bad friend -- was pretty amusing as the traditional sidekick. patch had great one-liners, both funny and smoldering. 
 but for all the occasional good, there was quite a bit in the way of bad. the dialogue was often stilted and weird. the analogies were completely out of left field. they were those turns of phrase that you can tell were used because they sounded cool, or because one was needed, but they don't mean anything, or they leave you thinking wtf? ""his eyes looked like they didn't play by the rules."" what does that even mean? what rules do eyes usually play by? does he not blink? this is a mild example, but i got sick of making note of them. i got this really hit-and-miss feel about the writing and the language in the book. pieces of literary crap mixed in with the really good bits blended to form a ""throw it all in and something's bound to work"" style. a total lack of finesse made it hard to want to keep reading -- and made me feel like if i kept rolling my eyeballs, they were going to roll right out of my head. 
 rant complete. so much yes. falling kingdoms crushed my heart but exceeded all my expectations. so good. if you love high fantasy, do yourself a favor and read this book. saw the movie, loved it, came home and immediately read this in one sitting! i was in fantastic beasts binge mode and it was like seeing the movie again! the story is brilliant and there's so much great detail in the screenplay. plus the actual physical edition of this book is absolutely gorgeous. 
 i do suggest seeing the movie first (it's so fun and visually stunning--go see it) and the screenplay doesn't add much new stuff (a few little details and confirmations you might not pick up watching the movie) but still, this is definitely a wonderful addition to my collection of wizarding world things! another amazing novel by rick riordan! cant wait to start the next novel and see how this all ends! this was so great! i absolutely love the world building--there's a cool magic system and lots of different cities/cultures that have really fascinating dynamics. the ensemble cast of characters is also fantastic! they all have interesting backstories and distinct personalities. writing is great, story is awesome, pacing on point. it wasn't quite perfect, but it was pretty freaking close, and i can't wait for the sequel! 
 if you want a fantasy book with an awesome world, a well developed cast of characters, and an exciting heist storyline--this is definitely the book for you. my video review - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbgmr... 
 this was awesome. it did take me a little bit to really get into it, but once i was in, i was so in. it was so atmospheric, and i was really impressed with the details and the amount of research that had to go into writing this. the time travel aspect was fascinating and just straight up cool, i loved our two main characters and was so happy that we got to see from both of their povs. and that ending! let's just say i'm eagerly anticipating book 2. 
 if you're looking for a cool time travel book, or you love atmospheric stories with rich settings and historical details, or if you just want to read an awesome 'questing through time' type adventure, this is probably the book for you! ""you ask how much of it was me,"" he whispers. ""some. enough."" 
 dear mare, stop picking the wrong brother. 
 ***warning, spoilers abound, do not continue with this review unless you have read the book.**** 
 first of all, i called it. i knew that we'd be getting lots of maven and seeing the boy behind the villain's mask in this one. and praise the book gods, i'm so glad victoria didn't let me down. she gave us all those moments we hoped for, the explanation, the moments of fragility, the tension, everything... she gave me a beautiful, tragic, tormented villain who fell in love with the wrong girl. 
 ....i say wrong because mare does not deserve this darkling, this twisted warner of a king. her reaction to his kiss, during the vulnerable tenuous moment between the two was what finally convinced me to give up on their love story (whereas in shatter me you could pick up on something in warner & juliette's kiss, here there's nothing. it's gone, alright, i get the message. mare feels nothing but disgust, it's a ""violation of the worst kind"" -she's in control and she'll never pick the villain). while i have never felt the spark between mare and cal (yup, even in this book including that scene), she's never going to be maven's. that's fine, i'll take him. mare doesn't deserve him, even though maven is more like her than cal will ever be. 
 this is a boy who was crippled from birth by an evil woman so terrible he doesn't know what thoughts are his. i just want him to have a happily ever after. but there is none. this boy is darkness incarnate and i have a feeling he's going to end up doing something noble to save cal or mare or his people in the next (final) book (to redeem himself the only way a villain can) and i just can't cope. 
 the first book is still my favorite, but king's cage gave me so many beautiful twisted lines. victoria is a master of powerful prose, and she delivered some exceptional ones --as you might expect, my favorite ones were his. 
 ""love makes you weak. and she's right. i learned that before i even knew you."" 
 ""i'm not a fool, little lightning girl. if you're going to play in my head, i'm going to play in yours. it's what we're good at."" 
 .... i could try to write a review of this entire book, but let's be honest, i read it for maven and i don't have the heart to write everything up because i'm in mourning for a ship that will never sail. 
 (yes, i realize maven does not have blonde hair but this gif fits perfectly) 
 #teammaven holy crap. my favorite book in this series so far!! ugh so good. an ember in the ashes is truly a unique and captivating book that i recommends everybody reads! cannot wait for the second book in this series =d there are two kinds of books, those that you finish reading and leave you with fleeting memories of the attractive hero, the silly heroine, and the overall storyline, or perhaps all you noted was the glaring plot holes, inconsistencies, ridiculousness or flat characters. at any rate, it's a book that you read, either like or dislike, but no sooner than you have turned the last page, it is out of sight and out of mind. then there is the other kind of book that will touch your heart, or awaken a lingering memory or a potential fear that will haunt your mind so that even long after you've fallen asleep, your unconscious self is still wading through the details. your dreams will be fitful and when you finally awaken, you will find yourself tangled up in sheets with puffy, swollen eyes from tears that you shed when you weren't even aware enough to know you were crying. if i stay is the latter. 
 mia is eighteen and has the kind of family any of us would pray to be born to and the kind of boyfriend that can only exist in the fictitious world. furthermore, she is a gifted musician and is about to be accepted into the prestigious julliard. mia has a choice, she can follow her love of music, go to julliard and accomplish her cellist dreams, or she can stay with her family and the love of her life and follow her heart. either way, she has something to gain and something to lose. then, one fateful morning, mia's world is turned on its head and life as she knows it changes. the one thing that remains the same is the question that mia has asked herself for the past few months, should i go or should i stay? 
 in art, the brightest colors appear beside the darkest of lines and in this book, the most endearing, tender and happy moments are surrounded by grief so palpable, that you will laugh through your tears and sob with a smile. if i stay demonstrates the kind of beauty that can only exist alongside despair and shines all the more for it. it is filled with happiness and sorrow, laughter and tears, birth and death, love and loss. by writing a book filled with parallels, forman proves that life has no opposite and thus leaves readers with an overwhelming since of joy and hope despite tears and grief that they are bound to feel. 
 **update** i just re-read this book for the forth time and it continues to devastate and delight me. this series is so cool. i love the setting, the characters, the story, and especially the format! piecing together the story through these ""hacked"" documents and messages just makes for an awesome reading experience, and i cannot wait for book 3! this was so great! it was funny and adorable and just left me with the biggest smile plastered on my face! it did take me a little bit to get into the story because there were so many characters i had trouble keeping them straight at times, but the main character simon is well developed and relatable and really grounded the story. i thought the mystery was great (and was so excited when i correctly guessed who blue was!) and i liked that despite the blackmail and the tension, it was still a mostly lighthearted uplifting kind of book. 
 overall, i really enjoyed this. i didn't love it quite as much as i've loved books by stephanie perkins and rainbow rowell, but i definitely felt that it was along those same lines. looking forward to reading more from this author! ""gansey."" a pause. ""that's all there is."" 
 how much can i rave about these books? 
 this review contains *spoilers*. 
 i've been waiting for this moment for months now, but i can finally say that i've finished reading the raven king. i was so nervous going into this because my expectations were sky-high, but it is everything i could've dreamed it to be and more. i felt like my heart was cracking throughout this whole experience. 
 depending on where you began the story, it was about gansey and the revelation that he knows that this might be his last year to find the king and complete his ongoing quest once and for all. 
 the raven king is set a week after the events of the last book, maura is back home with artemus, who knows more than he is saying and is acting rather peculiar- especially when gwenllian is around. and blue and her raven boys are still on their quest to find the king. 
 the uncertainty over everything kept me on the edge for the entire story. it felt like the end of everything. 
 i was hooked as soon as i read the first sentence. and i was so into the story that i couldn't stop reading until the last page (and i unfortunately had a huge headache after reading so much). 
 but i laughed, i cried, i mourned. 
 what more could i ask of stiefvater, a master storyteller? 
 she creates these atmospheric, impressionistic scenes with this quiet but impeccable style. 
 i want everyone to know her talents but i don't want to share her with anyone. 
 for the past month i've talked and ranted so much about these characters that even my mom got invested and was waiting for me to tell her what happened in the final book. (by the way, she said that gansey wasn't going to die) (thanks mom for believing.) 
 as i mentioned before, it starts with gansey's incredibly rich and unique tale and continues with his found family. 
 ""where the hell is ronan?"" gansey asked, echoing the words that thousands of humans had uttered since mankind developed speech."" 
 what is my review worth without mentioning ronan too many times? 
 but seriously, he continues to amaze me and he's just an all-time favorite of mine that i won't be letting go of any time soon. 
 also, i'm in love with this fanart of him: 
 source 
 ""gansey asked, ""do you have time to run an errand with us? do you have work? homework?"" 
 ""no homework. i got suspended,"" blue replied. 
 ""get the fuck out,"" ronan said, but with admiration. ""sargent, you asshole."" 
 blue reluctantly allowed him to bump fists with her as gansey eyed her meaningfully in the rearview mirror."" 
 my life, i love ronan too much. my new goal is for him to say the exact same things to me. 
 ""for what?"" 
 ""emptying another student's backpack over his car. i don't really want to talk about it."" 
 ""i do,"" ronan said. 
 ""well, i don't. i'm not proud of it."" 
 ronan patted her leg. ""i'll be proud for you."" 
 he's seriously the best. 
 ""strange he hadn't had a premonition of what this place would become to him all those months ago. "" 
 adam perfectly described how i feel about this series. these books have become my home and i cannot believe it took me so long to discover. i love it in a way that nearly overwhelms me with gratitude 
 i also loved that this book focused on the romance (among many other happenings), and it was slow, uncertain and exquisitely written. my heart is still happy and beating like crazy. 
 ""each of the trees they passed sounded with a processed thud, until the sound around them was the pulsing electronic beat that invariably played in ronan's car or headphones. 
 ""oh god,"" gansey said, but he was laughing. ""do we have to endure that here, too? ronan!"" 
 ""it wasn't me,"" ronan said. he looked to blue, who shrugged. he caught adam's eye. when adam's mouth quirked, ronan's expression stilled for a moment before turning to the loose smile he ordinarily reserved for matthew's silliness. adam felt a surge of both accomplishment and nerves. he skated an edge here. making ronan lynch smile felt as charged as making a bargain with cabeswater. these weren't forces to play with."" 
 and while i'm on the topic of ronan, i finally got to see him with his brothers and it was too good to be true. i was so happy maggie included it. 
 ""where are you? in your room?"" 
 ""dur."" 
 ""i'm serious."" 
 ""hur."" 
 ""matthew."" 
 ""yah, yah, i'm in my room. sl hates you. it's like two or sumthin'. whatdya want?"" 
 ronan didn't reply right away. matthew couldn't see him, but he was curled on his bed back at monmouth, forehead resting on his knees, one hand gripping the back of his own skull, phone pressed to his ear. ""just to know you're all right."" 
 "" 'm all right."" 
 ""go to sleep, then."" 
 ""still sleeping now."" 
 the brothers hung up."" 
 ronan is seriously messing me up. i love him with all my heart. 
 and another favorite part in this book was when declan and ronan finally sat down and just talked. 
 ""declan started: ""we need to talk about your future."" 
 ""no,"" ronan said. ""no, no, we don't."" 
 he was already most of the way out of the car, leaves snapping dead under his shoes. 
 ""ronan, wait!"" 
 ronan did not wait. 
 ""ronan! before he died, when he and i were out together, dad told me a story about you."" 
 it was wickedly unfair. 
 it was wickedly unfair because there was nothing else that would have stopped ronan from walking away."" 
 why does his childhood make me cry? 
 ""declan paused then, sighing, as if the weight of the story was a tangible thing, and he needed to take a moment to regain his strength. it was true that the memory of the ritual was heavy enough. ronan was all tangled up in half-formed images of his father sitting on the end of matthew's bed, the brothers tumbled together at its head, his mother perched on that tatty desk chair no one else would sit at. she loved these stories, too, especially the ones about her."" 
 i really love hearing about his childhood. 
 ""on the outside, the three lynch brothers appeared remarkably dissimilar: declan, a butter-smooth politician; ronan, a bull in a china-shop world; matthew, a sunlit child. 
 on the inside, the lynch brothers were remarkably similar: they all loved cars, themselves, and each other."" 
 ronan and his family are unlike anyone else and i love how everyone is involved in this book and that the adults care about the kids and vice versa and nobody is excluded and it's just great great great. 
 also great great great, were adam and ronan: 
 ""what are you trying to find out?"" 
 adam described the circumstances surrounding his eye and his hand with the same level tone he would use to answer a question in class. he allowed ronan to lean in to compare his eyes - close enough that ronan felt his breath on his cheek - and he allowed ronan to study the palm of his hand. the latter was not strictly necessary, and they both knew it, but adam watched ronan closely as he lightly traced the lines there."" 
 maggie knows exactly where to hit home for me. 
 ""why are we here?"" he asked. 
 ""wrong devil,"" adam replied quietly. 
 it had not been that long since the court case against his father. he knew that ronan remained righteously furious over the outcome: robert parrish, a first-time offender in the eyes of the court, had walked away with a fine and probation. "" 
 ""what ronan didn't realize was that the victory hadn't been in the punishment. adam didn't need his father to go to jail. he had merely needed someone outside the situation to look at it and confirm that yes, a crime had been committed. adam had not invented it, spurred it, deserved it. it said so on the court paperwork. robert parrish, guilty. adam parrish, free."" 
 i love adam and yes, he continues to break my heart. adam is the one i related to the most, and i'm so proud of him and his character growth. and i love how ronan and adam support one another. 
 i was barely recovering from them when i got to see gansey and blue being so sweet. all i can say is that gansey has got a way with words. 
 ""it was this: gansey starting down the stairs to the kitchen, blue starting up, meeting in the middle. it was gansey stepping aside to let her pass, but changing his mind. he caught her arm and then the rest of her. she was warm, alive, vibrant beneath the thin cotton; he was warm, alive, vibrant beneath his. blue slid her hand over his bare shoulder and then on to his chest, her palm spread out flat on his breastbone, her fingers pressed curiously into his skin. 
 i thought you would be hairier, she whispered. 
 sorry to disappoint. the legs have a bit more going on. 
 mine too."" 
 i'm really glad he and blue stopped trying to hide their relationship from the group. and gansey being, as maggie said in her recap, a dick but not a dick: 
 ""he gathered himself. adam saw his gaze land on blue. judging, perhaps, whether or not she knew what he was about to say, or whether he should say it. he touched his thumb to his lower lip, caught himself at it, lowered his hand. 
 ""blue and i have been seeing each other,"" he said. ""i don't want to hurt any feelings, but i want to keep seeing her. i don't want to hide it any more. it's eating me, and nights like this, having to stand here and look at blue with her face like this and pretend like --"" he drew himself to a stop, a full stop, a silence so intense that no one tipped any other sound into it. then he finished, repeating, ""i cannot ask you to do things i haven't been doing myself. i'm sorry for being a hypocrite."" 
 ""blue took gansey's hand. 
 adam was glad she did. 
 ""gross,"" ronan said, which was the most juvenile response possible. 
 but gansey said, ""thanks for the input, ronan,"" with a proper look on his face again, and adam saw how cleverly ronan had released the tension of the moment. they could all breathe again."" 
 this is exactly why i love ronan so much. if anyone asked me why, i would just show this one quote. 
 i think this book might be my favorite in the series because so much happened and i am in awe by maggie stiefvater's ability to write something so beautiful and descriptive, so exciting and so heartbreaking. 
 and as she also promised in her recap, henry cheng shows up more and i really liked him in this book, which i honestly wasn't expecting. 
 ""what are you doing here!"" blue demanded. she was feeling - she wasn't sure. she was feeling a lot. 
 ""i'm here to talk about the men in your life. to talk about the men in my life. i like the dress, by the way. very boho chic or whatever. i was on my way home, and i wanted to find out if you had a good time at the toga party and also make sure that our plans for zimbabwe were still on. i see you tried to claw your own eye out; it's edgy."" 
 ""blue said, ""i can't get in this car. do you see what's happening behind me? i don't even want to look."" 
 henry said, ""how about you give me the finger and shout at me now and withdraw with your principles?"" he smiled winningly and held up three fingers. he counted to two with devil horns. 
 ""this is incredibly unnecessary,"" blue told him, but she could feel herself smiling. 
 ""life's a show,"" he replied. he counted one with his middle finger, and then his face melted into exaggerated shock. 
 blue shouted, ""drop dead, you bastard!"" 
 ""fine!"" henry screamed back, with slightly more hysteria than the role required."" 
 he was such an intriguing character, especially with the whole robobee situation. 
 and then the book circles back to ronan and adam, and i'm not freaking out or smiling or anything like that: 
 ""he wordlessly crossed the floor and sat beside adam on the mattress. when he held out his hand, adam put the model into it. 
 ""this old thing,"" ronan said. he turned the front tyre, and again the music played out of it. they sat like that for a few minutes, as ronan examined the car and turned each wheel to play a different tune. adam watched how intently ronan studied the seams, his eyelashes low over his light eyes. ronan let out a breath, put the model down on the bed beside him, and kissed adam."" 
 he surprised me so much that my heart started beating too fast. it was such a perfectly build up moment and i'm speechless and in love and in tears and and and. time stopped for me. this is giving me life right now, this is giving me so much life. 
 ""he was pretty sure he had just been ronan's first kiss."" 
 i reread that page so many times that i now remember every single word. someone finally got kissed, my favorite someone, and it was such a genuine and real moment. too good for words. 
 i was speechless for so long, but henry managed to perfectly describe how i was feeling: 
 ""his mother was the only one who knew what henry meant when he said that he wasn't good with words. she was always trying to explain things to his father, especially when she had decided to become seondeok instead of his wife. it is that, she for ever said, but also something more. "" 
 this is exactly how i feel when i try to explain my love for this series and the characters within. 
 but then, you know what's happening next, the most painful moment that i dreaded and hoped hoped hoped wouldn't happen. (but secretly wanted to see played out-- but also didn't.) 
 ""tell me where owen glendower is,"" he said to the darkness. crisp and sure, with the same power he had used to command noah, to command the skeletons in the cave. ""show me where the raven king is."" 
 ""wait. you're going to junk up your nice coat, white man. take this."" he shouldered out of his aglionby sweater and proffered it. 
 ""so you're literally giving me the shirt off your back,"" gansey said, swapping him for his coat. he was grateful. he looked up to henry. ""see you on the other side. excelsior."" 
 i started crying here because no, henry, no. 
 but then gansey and the group find glendower and go in, only to find it to be not as they imagined: 
 ""the only thing was that gansey had always feared that he would find glendower just a little too late. minutes, days, months after death. but this man had been dead for centuries. the helmet and skull were only metal and bone."" 
 ""gansey touched the skull, the raised cheekbone, the face of his promised and ruined king. everything was dry and gray. 
 it was over. 
 this man was not going to ever be anything to gansey. 
 ""gansey?"" blue asked. 
 every minute was giving way to another and then another, and slowly it sank into his heart, all the way to the centre: 
 it was over."" 
 but it wasn't really. 
 ""one of the great things about blue sargent was that she never really gave up hope. he would have told her this, but he knew it would only upset her more. he said, ""i can't watch ronan die, blue. and adam - and matthew - and all this? we don't have anything else. you already saw my spirit. you already know what we chose!"" 
 blue closed her eyes, and two tears ran out of them. she did not cry noisily, or in a way that asked him to say anything different. she was a hopeful creature, but she was also a sensible creature."" 
 i was hopeful till the last page. 
 ""there was no time. 
 ""thanks for everything, henry,"" gansey said. ""you're a prince among men."" 
 henry's face was blank. 
 blue said, ""i hate this."" 
 it was right, though. gansey felt the feeling of time slipping - one last time. the sense of having done this before. he gently laid the backs of his hands on her cheeks. he whispered, ""it'll be ok. i'm ready. blue, kiss me."" 
 the power to stay quiet in the middle of the night while crying was nearly impossible, especially when listening to sad music. 
 ""he pulled back from her. 
 out loud, with intention, with the voice that left no room for doubt, he said, ""let it be to kill the demon."" 
 right after he spoke, blue threw her arms tightly around his neck. right after he spoke, she pressed her face into the side of his. right after he spoke, she held him like a shouted word. love, love, love. 
 he fell quietly from her arms. 
 he was a king."" 
 maggie really knew how to destroy me, i needed him back. 
 ""ronan crouched beside him, black still smeared on his face under his nose and around his ears. his dreamt firefly rested on gansey's heart. ""wake up, you bastard,"" he said. ""you fucker. i can't believe that you would ..."" 
 and he began to cry."" 
 ""i just don't understand,"" henry said. ""i was so sure that this was going to ... change everything. i didn't think it would end like this."" 
 ""i always knew it was going to end like this,"" she said, ""but it still doesn't feel right. would this ever feel right?"" 
 would it? 
 ""the minute hand quivered. it quivered again. 
 blue was already tired of a timeline without gansey in it. 
 adam looked up from where he was folded in the grass. his voice was small. ""what about cabeswater?"" 
 ""what about it?"" ronan asked. ""it's not powerful enough to do anything any more."" 
 ""i know,"" adam replied. ""but if you asked - it might die for him."" 
 i seriously cannot remember a time when i've felt so deeply for a character's (near) death. 
 ""the last tree fell, and the forest was gone, and everything was absolutely silent. 
 blue touched gansey's face. she whispered, ""wake up."" 
 i truly applaud stiefvater for everything she managed to conclude in this book. she really brought him back. and ronan and adam and blue and everyone and just thank you. 
 ""he closed his eyes and he began to dream."" 
 this review and more can be found on my blog. right after i finished this book, i had a bit of an accident. i was running with a pair of lightsabers when i tripped and fell and accidentally sliced the entire book to shreds!! maybe it's not a good idea to run with lightsabers... 
 city of fallen angels is amazing - oh wait, that was weird, my keyboard cut me off. this is some sort of conspiracy isn't it? like the way that certain unnamed sites sometimes don't like to publish non-glowing reviews. i never write those. *angelic smile* oh, did that angelic smile make me look like jace? he's such a pretty, shiny angel. *sigh* 
 as i was saying... this book is amazingly unnecessary. i'm sorry, fangirls. please don't eat me. 
 here is a general rundown. no specific twists are revealed just vaguely referenced, so possible spoilers: 
 part one 
 ch 1-2: simon talks to people. jace and clary talk to each other and kiss. 
 ch 3-5: simon talks to new guy. jace and clary talk to each other. 
 ch 6-8: clary talks to people. simon and jace talk about clary. 
 ch 9: jace, clary and simon all make out...oops, i mean, jace and clary make out. simon bites, ummmm, talks to girls and has relationship issues. 
 part two 
 ch 10-11: new guy is revealed. dun, dun, dun. blah, blah. an attack!! wonder woman saves the day. (wow, something actually happened.... for two seconds) vampire chat. 
 ch 12-13: people talk about the vampire chat. jace and clary do stuff. 
 ch 14-15: jace has issues. chatty, chatty, chatty. 
 ch 16-17: jace goes emo. weird stuff is revealed. 
 ch 18-19: clary believes in jace. things happen. 
 ch 20: chatting again. lovey dovey stuff. but wait - someone is alive! (luke skywalker scream - everyone join in with their best squeaky voice) nooooooooooo! 
 i have never given out a one star rating before. never! so trust me, i don't take this lightly at all and i don't enjoy being negative. making light of a bad situation is just something i try to do. however, i don't like disliking things and i never try to be flat out hateful about anything. to love everything would be great, but that's just not realistic. 
 don't just write me off as a hater and leave it at that. i actually really liked the original series. 
 let me explain - while knowing nothing of clare's plagiarism or the controversy surrounding the books, the need for something similar to buffy overwhelmed me, leading to the discovery of the urban fantasy genre. my first experience with this genre was the mortal instruments which had just released the third book. out of pure desperation, the fact that it was a derivative was not even almost a deterrent. clare told a fast-paced and action filled ya suspense, which was exactly what i needed at the time. 
 the first three mortal instruments had this addictive quality that made you need to read more, which led me to read this one. so while i still hold true to my original feelings of the first books and have a sick yet fond place in my heart for them, i truly feel that this particular series should have ended where city of glass left us. 
 it saddens me to think that i may have contributed to the mass production of unnecessary sequels. or to clare's dragon horde of gold. oh well, she's rolling in it, already. what exactly she deserves to be rolling in... i'll leave up to interpretation. this is a joke. no speculation is actually necessary. she's rolling in money. okay? are you happy?! you better be. 
 regardless of how much she has made, it is respectable for anyone to make bookoos of cash doing what they love. as long as they aren't hurting or taking advantage of anyone, there's no problem with it. although, sometimes large companies can take advantage of small time authors or even gullible readers, so it's a good thing that i got this from my library and didn't pay any of my own money (however, my library surely made a contribution). 
 it's too bad lesser-known books and their authors don't get the opportunities and the recognition that some of these more mainstream novels do. but that isn't how the industry works right now. hype sells. controversy sells. 
 fellow girl-power groupies: don't kill me. i liked jace in the original books. but i soon realized how destructive this small adoration can become. 
 now, fangirl mobbing is truly my greatest fear. so i don't want to piss anyone off, but jace is prick. a hot one, yes, and i readily admit to secret desires of being pursued by a ""bad boy"". but seriously? calm yourselves. he's fictional. 
 by the way that girls talk about him, you would think that his saliva is made of awesomesauce. 
 or that his face is made of the ark of the covenant. don't look directly at him! your skin might melt off. 
 i wanted to like this and wanted my jace crush to transfer over to this book. i swear i did. and maybe i was prepared to not like it because of a few certain friend reviews *cough* jillianhellionmajavinaya *cough* but i tried. really. enjoying this just wasn't in my power. 
 objectivity is something we should all strive for with every read. even after hearing bad things about a specific book, one can still have an open mind. when reviewing, we aren't trying to prove anyone right or wrong, we are just giving our own impressions about the book. 
 sometimes when an avid reader reads a mega-hyped book such as this, we can take on a similar persona to that of bill and ted. they are all about the excellent adventure. first and foremost with ya fantasy - we, mostly, want to be entertained. all the better if we learn something or absorb a good message while doing it, but the entertainment part is essential. 
 why i didn't like this book 
 not funny. at the time, i thought there was quite a bit of good humor in the originals. this one: nada. or maybe i've just outgrown it. the corners of my mouth never even lifted. in fact, a scowl probably made an appearance or two....or twenty. this book is to ""funny"" what vampires are to ""real"". (hint: they aren't) 
 not entertaining. every few pages i felt the need to go for a spin in my car with my head hanging out the window just to stay awake. the suspense, the tension, the action - everything i liked about the originals was gone. i'd say this book is about 1% action, 99% chatting. i may have entertained myself about this book, but this book did not entertain me. not for one second. 
 not new. this was a rehash of every conversation jace and clary and simon had in the first books that took up an entire book. clary, i love you but i can't because i think i'm evil. jace, you're so emo. simon, you're my best friend. this is a repeat. a rerun. and not even a funny rerun. it's like that sucky episode of friends with alec baldwin in it that no one cares to remember. 
 not inspiring. unlike most of my favorite books, there wasn't anything to take away from this book. if we are not going to be entertained then shouldn't we at least learn something or feel like we derived some deeper meaning from the book? 
 both ender's game and the hunger games had serious messages about war. the giver teaches us that human emotion is essential to our lives. what did city of fallen angels teach us? serious spoiler ahead. dont click unless you really want to know. that it is okay to be a prick because you've been possessed by a demon? maybe there was some deeper message and i just didn't see it because i was so bored. if so, i apologize for my oversight. 
 let's end on a high note, shall we? so i'll leave you with this: 
 even if i don't particularly like a book, i can usually find something good about having spent my time on it. this one was much more difficult to find that ""good part"", but i still managed to. 
 so despite not laughing once as a result of a joke in the book, i found myself, alone, laughing hysterically in my room about how horribly pointless this book was or about random crap that i find funny, usually involving jace and clary. somehow, i managed to amuse myself. 
 seriously. dumb stuff dances through my head like a frisky stallion does through a meadow full of unicorns. i wonder if jace is part unicorn, because unicorns are made of awesomesauce and rainbows..... i bet jace is made of rainbows. or at least, clary seems to think so - just wait until she figures out that he has no pots of gold. 
 and before i go find something awesome to read, i have something to ask you: 
 question: quick! both jace and clary are drowning. you can only save one. what should you do? 
 answer: let them both drown and read a different book!! this was funny and weird and fascinating and i had such a good time reading it! i just loved seeing how everything unfolded from this different perspective. it made twilight fresh and exciting again, and i really enjoyed it! before i start my review, can we just take a minute to admire this beautiful piece of art featuring my favorites:

 ""i will have you without armour, kaz brekker. or i will not have you at all."" 
 this review contains *spoilers*. 
 the wait for this grandiose sequel has been all-consuming, i've been thinking about the dregs for months and months now, so getting back into their lives has been one of the most rewarding experiences. 
 the book opens on wylan still wearing kuwei yul-bo's features since nina didn't trust herself with her powers now. it had been just under a week since the dregs reached ketterdam, almost a month since they'd left djerholm. and they're all fighting to get inej back before van eck could have his way with her. 
 they were almost out of time. but none of them knew the real game kaz ""dirtyhands"" brekker - the smooth, smart, criminal mastermind - was running. 
 and so, piece by piece, the plan to rescue inej had come together. 
 things were about to get dangerous. 
 ""why do you guys say that, anyway? no mourners, no funerals? why not just say good luck or be safe?"" 
 ""we like to keep our expectations low."" 
 literally one of my most pressing questions for the sequel was answered so quickly!! 
 but the days until van eck's deadline were dwindling, and to get inej back, they would need surprise on their side. only one shot at getting the wraith out of this situation. 
 but before all that can happen, we get to read from the pov of my favorite warrior: inej ghafa, legend of the barrel. and let me tell you, she is one of the most strong and determined and courageous characters i've known, so watching her doubt herself and her saints damn near broke me. what she had to go through in her first chapter left me both shaking and trembling. ghafa has my soul, heart and my enter being wrapped around her pinky. 
 ""when fear arrives, something is about to happen."" 
 meanwhile, the dregs have gathered enough intel to get their girl the hell out of van eck's hole. i felt truly terrified for inej because that brute managed to get into her head, but she was done being frightened of this man. and so was i--thanks to both her and the man of the hour, my favorite bastard of the barrel: kaz brekker with that demonic cane. 
 you know, i forgot for a second there just how dark he can be when it comes down to business. but he's called dirtyhands for a reason, and we're reminded just exactly what he had done to earn his reputation. 
 ""sometimes, the only way to get justice is to take it for yourself."" 
 i'm still furious at myself for believing that that smug merch son of a bitch could outthink kaz brekker. and with the help of his loyal dregs, they manage to get inej of out harm's way... but not without trouble coming their way. the kind of trouble even jan van eck hadn't foreseen: shu with wings (!!) looking to hunt and capture grisha. 
 but the deal is the deal and van eck has to pay up--dirtyhands is not someone to piss off. they'd set out to get inej back from van eck and they had. but they're not done with the merch. and the plan the dregs have set is so intricate that it will be the end of the van eck empire, without a shadow of a doubt. 
 okay so, here's the official plan to both earning their thirty million kruge and obliterating the devil himself: they're going after van eck's sugar crop, since he controls the silos where the supply is produced: 
 * thanks to wylan's weevil they can destroy the sugar in van eck's silos without being exposed. 
 * ""my father can weather a loss. the other merchants, the ones who own the sugar in his silos, will be hit worse."" 
 * and once the other merchants learn that van eck has been buying up sugar that isn't stored in his silos (thanks to kaz purchasing shares on behalf of van eck), his reputation will be annihilated. 
 ""van eck's reputation will take a hit when the sugar is lost. but when the people who paid him to keep it safe find out he profited from their loss, they'll look more closely at those silos."" 
 ""and find the remnants of the weevil,"" finished wylan. 
 ""destruction of property, tampering with the markets,"" inej murmured. ""it will be the end of him."" 
 * they'll get the weevil into the silos by letting tiny and ferocious inej do what she's best at: climbing up twenty stories high and walking a high wire from one silo to the next...no biggie. 
 * and while doing all of the above, they're also going to get the rest of the grisha out of the city, at nina's request. 
 a ship to ravka with twenty passengers (including kuwei) is conspicuous, so they're going to steal van eck's own transport to remain obscure. they couldn't just be smarter than their opponent, they had to be relentless. 
 * i just... why is everything so damn complicated with the dregs. they're nothing if not ambitious. 
 ""you couldn't go to war with an upstanding merch like van eck, not if you were a thug with a reputation dirtier than a stable hand's boot sole. to win, kaz would have to level the field. he would show the world what he already knew: despite his soft hands and fine suits, van eck was a criminal, just as bad as any barrel thug--worse, because his word was worth nothing."" 
 it's a known fact that kaz brekker is a smooth, smart, criminal mastermind, but he also hurts for his big, criminally inclined family. and watching him realize just that was one of my most cherished scenes. 
 ""he was going to break my legs ,"" she said, her chin held high, the barest quaver in her voice. ""would you have come for me then, kaz? when i couldn't scale a wall or walk a tightrope? when i wasn't the wraith anymore?"" 
 dirtyhands would not. the boy who could get them through this, get their money, keep them alive, would do her the courtesy of putting her out of her misery, then cut his losses and move on. 
 ""i would come for you,"" he said, and when he saw the wary look she shot him, he said it again. ""i would come for you. and if i couldn't walk, i'd crawl to you, and no matter how broken we were, we'd fight our way out together--knives drawn, pistols blazing. because that's what we do. we never stop fighting."" 
 i cant stop thinking about this without getting goosebumps. damn you, kaz. 
 you know, speaking of which, wylan finding out that his mother was still alive and in an insane asylum because of rotten van eck, made me want to string his father up in a barren field and let the vultures have at him, to quote jesper. 
 but seriously that whole situation made my heart race. i couldn't believe to what levels of evil van eck would sink. the only silver lining was the whole plan kaz had in store for the devil. and hopefully seeing wylan reunite with marya hendriks. i'm always weak for stories reuniting mother and son. always. 
 also, jesper trying to cheer wylan up made me shed a tear or two... 
 ""hey,"" jesper said, giving him a shake. ""hey. your father could have made a lot of choices when he found out you couldn't read. hell, he could have said you were blind or that you had trouble with your vision. or better yet, he could have just been happy about the fact that he had a genius for a son."" 
 ""i'm not a genius."" 
 ""you're stupid about a lot of things, wylan, but you are not stupid. and if i ever hear you call yourself a moron again, i'm going to tell matthias you tried to kiss nina. with tongue."" 
 wylan wiped his nose on his sleeve. ""he'll never believe it."" 
 ""then i'll tell nina you tried to kiss matthias. with tongue."" 
 they seriously deserve the world and so much more. they all did. 
 this was them at their best. 
 and then halfway through the book, the plan suddenly changes because ketterdam has turned on kaz. ""but if you couldn't open a door, you just had to make a new one."" and that's what dirtyhands excels at. 
 ""i know how to do it,"" kaz said slowly. ""how to get kuwei out, get the grisha out, get our money, beat van eck, and give that son of a bitch pekka rollins everything he has coming to him."" 
 nina raised a brow. ""is that all?"" 
 ""how?"" asked inej. 
 ""this whole time, we've been playing van eck's game. we've been hiding. we're done with that. we're going to stage a little auction. right out in the open."" he turned to face them, and his eyes gleamed flat and black as a shark's. ""and since kuwei is so eager to sacrifice himself, he's going to be the prize."" 
 my heart leapt like a horse clearing a jump. kuwei is going to auction himself with the hopes that the ravkans will end up buying him. it was the best chance they had of getting kuwei to ravka and saving grisha lives. to quote brekker, it was a mad, spiky monster of a plan, and that was what it had to be for them to succeed. 
 seriously though, how does bardugo keep up with herself? there were so many twists and turns that left my mind spinning even after having closed my eyes. the whole storyline is just so lancing--we know where the end-game is supposed to be, but to get there the dregs would have to go through hell and back. and damn, that they did. 
 but before hell comes their way, kaz and inej share an intimate moment that left me undone. he had gone to great lengths to prove he was capable of anything. 
 ""the sickness was there, the need to run, the need for something else too. kaz thought he knew the language of pain intimately, but this ache was new. it hurt to stand here like this, so close to the circle of her arms. it isn't easy for me either. after all she'd endured, he was the weak one. but she would never know what it was like for him to see nina pull her close, watch jesper loop his arm through hers, what it was to stand in doorways and against walls and know he could never draw nearer."" 
 i'll be 100% honest, this choked me up a little bit. 
 ""before he even knew what he intended, he lowered his head. she drew in a sharp breath. his lips hovered just above the warm juncture between her shoulder and the column of her neck. he waited. tell me to stop. push me away. 
 she exhaled. ""go on,"" she repeated. finish the story."" 
 my heart should not be making that sound. 
 ""the barest movement and his lips brushed her skin--warm, smooth, beaded with moisture. desire coursed through him, a thousand images he'd hoarded, barely let himself imagine--the fall of her dark hair freed from its braid, his hand fitted to the lithe curve of her waist, her lips parted, whispering his name. 
 all of it there and then gone. "" 
 this is heaven, what i truly want. i have no words to thank you for this. 
 seriously, leigh can write evocative, raw and hauntingly powerful scenes like nobody's business. 
 ""two of the deadliest people the barrel had to offer and they could barely touch each other without both of them keeling over. but they'd tried. he'd tried. maybe they could try again."" 
 they truly deserve their happy ending. 
 but in the end, it all came down to this: ""brekker, his wraith queen, his rotten little court of thugs."" because no matter what would happen, the dregs had a way of rewriting their own rules. 
 i mean, that ending... that ending was every bit as epic as i had anticipated. it either would've gone brilliantly or in total disaster, but that's generally the way this crew likes to work. 
 also, one last minor thing: i was on the edge the whole time to see who would survive, even though the table of contents kind of gave away who lives, who dies, who tells their story... but i cannot, for the life in me, believe matthias helvar got killed off by a young druskelle. this is not what i want. this is not what i planned. 
 ""after all their mad escapes and close calls, he'd started to believe the six of them were somehow charmed, that his guns, kaz's brains, nina's wit, inej's talent, wylan's ingenuity, and matthias' strength had made them somehow untouchable. they might suffer. they might take their knocks, but wylan was right, in the end they were all supposed to stay standing. 
 ""no mourners,"" said jesper, surprised by the ache of tears in his throat. 
 ""no funerals,"" they all replied softly."" 
 my eyes burned, tears streaming down my cheeks. i was whispering ""come back to me,"" right there with nina. 
 i just... i was rooting for everyone to have their happy ending. everyone. so this death came as such a shocking reveal. i felt sorrow dragging at my heart for hours after that. and i'm still not over it. 
 this saintsforsaken book has taken away a piece of my heart with that ending. i've got this ache in my chest that won't go away. i want to be free. but i know i won't be forgetting the dregs anytime soon.

 this review and more can be found on my blog. so freakin good. this just became one of my favorite books of the year, and one of my favorite contemporary novels of all time! it was funny and romantic and touching and so beautifully written! i loved it. i literally just finished it and i already want to reread it. highly recommended! the heat of the incinerator wrapped around inej like a living thing, a desert dragon in his den, hiding from the ice, waiting for her. she knew her body's limits, and she knew she had no more to give. she'd made a bad wager. it was as simple as that. the autumn leaf might cling to its branch, but it was already dead. the only question was when it would fall. 
 let go, inej. her father had taught her to climb, to trust the rope, the swing, and finally, to trust in her own skill, to believe that if she leaped, she would reach the other side. would he be waiting for her there? let go, inej. should she jump now or simply wait for her body to give out? 
 my mind is spinning. i tend to prefer simplicity in books. i hate a ridiculously complicated plot. i hate unnecessary characters. for the young adult genre, this book can best be described as epic, because. it. is. huge. it is complicated. it's like 
 ocean's eleven 
 for the ya fantasy crowd in the very best of ways. 
 there are 6 main characters. typically, that's 4 more than i'd like. the book's downfall is also what makes it great, and it's why i docked a star. it's epic. perhaps too epic. too complicated books tend to confuse me and let's face it, a large cast with different povs tend to make it extremely confusing for the reader - and it is, to an extent, true in this book. it is nonstop action with nary a moment to breathe. there is a cast of characters in the beginning, and by god, you'll need it. sometimes i felt like i was memorizing things for a test. 
 but the good is that the characters are all bad-ass. the packleader is an anti-hero, which, in my opinion, is the best kind of character. 
 kaz narrowed his eyes. ""i'm not some character out of a children's story who plays harmless pranks and steals from the rich to give to the poor."" 
 i like them dirty. and the book moves at a breakneck speed that'll guarantee the reader's interest. 
 there's magic - naturally. but a different kind of magic than such was found in the grisha. the characters are well-written, they're a ragtag band of misfits, and not exactly friends, but all are united for a common mission, and most importantly, they each have a purpose. there are no redundant, extraneous characters, but each character is doing this for their own reason. 
 four million kruge, freedom, a chance to return home. she'd said she wanted these things. but in her heart, she couldn't bear the thought of returning to her parents. could she tell her mother and father the truth? would they understand all she'd done to survive, not just at the menagerie, but every day since? could she lay her head in her mother's lap and be forgiven? what would they see when they looked at her? 
 the female characters are kick-ass. they're feminine, but not useless. they don't try too hard to be rebels to be bad-ass, to deny their own nature to prove they can play with the boys, they're just themselves...that's confusing, i know, but i can't describe it any other way. 
 there is romance, but so little of it, and what little there is felt natural and unobtrusive. a blossoming from grudging tolerance to like, to possibly something more. but i consider this a great book, because the romance is not intrusive in any way. 
 every time she moved, the reindeer cloak parted, revealing a flash of round calf, white skin, the shadow between her breasts. it was deliberate. he knew it. she was trying to rattle him. he needed to focus on the fire. he'd almost died, and if he didn't get a fire started, he still might. 
 nina snorted and lay down in the nest of pelts, propping herself on one elbow. ""for saint's sake, druskelle, what's wrong with you? i just wanted to be warm. i promise not to ravish you in your sleep."" 
 ""i'm not afraid of you,"" he said irritably. 
 her grin was vicious. ""then you're as stupid as you look."" 
 he stayed crouching beside the fire. he knew he was meant to lie down next to her. the sun had set, and the temperature was dropping. he was struggling to keep his teeth from chattering, and they would need each other's warmth to get through the night. it shouldn't have concerned him, but he didn't want to be near her. because she's a killer, he told himself. that's why. she's a killer and a witch. 
 halle-freaking-lujah! survival + rationality > romance!!!!!! *wipes away tear* i never thought i'd see the day. he's the hottest korean i've ever seen. 
 not that i have much experience with koreans, but all the ones i've encountered couldn't even be considered in the same realm as sophie's brother. 
 this is not a book for k-pop lovers. it is a book about a superior, condescending american and how she spreads her knowledge to the poor ignorant k-pop star. 
 ""she doesn't play any instrument,"" yoon jae provides. ""she just knows everything about music."" 
 ""that's not true,"" i say. but i can't help smiling at his blind confidence in me. ""i only know a few things."" 
 ""would you be interested in helping me with a new song?"" jason asks. 
 this book is the k-pop equivalent of the last samurai. let me explain. the last samurai is widely held as the movie that displays a prime example of western superiority. long story short: white guy goes into japan without knowing anything, the language, the culture, the combat styles, out-samurais all the japanese dudes, wins the heart of the fairest japanese woman in the village. 
 this book can pretty much be described in the same manner. white girl goes into south korea. not knowing the language, the customs, improves the k-pop industry, wins the heart of the hottest k-pop idol in the land. 
 bullshit. absolutely bullshit. this book displays the stereotype of the ugly american at its worst. the main character is condescending, views everything foreign as ""exotic,"" is completely unwilling to learn and appreciate the culture, and steadfastly clings onto her own standards without embracing the new. american tourists have a pretty bad reputation abroad, and the main character in this book displays no deviation from that stereotype. 
 this book mocks korean culture. from the way the people smells, to the heavy accent, to the squat toilets, to the language, to the formalities within the culture. 
 ""why are there so many different levels of formality?"" i ask jason, praying he's feeling gracious. ""i don't get it."" 
 ""it has to do with respect,"" he says, shocking me. ""you want to give respect to people who have authority over you or are older."" 
 ""okay, i get that, but seven levels? really?"" 
 he doesn't answer. 
 ""it's dumb"" pops out of my mouth before i can stop it, and i mentally kick myself. just what i need--to insult the language of the country i just moved to. 
 if you are expecting a lot of k-pop loving, as i did. be prepared for severe disappointment. 
 i don't have the nerve to tell him his music is heartless, mass-produced fluff. 
 the main character's superior attitude towards k-pop and korean music makes me want to gag. 
 ""but you think i should make it more like your american music?"" he asks. 
 ""you say that like it's a bad thing."" 
 this book made me rage. i wouldn't recommend it for k-pop fans. i wouldn't recommend it for any kind of light, summery read. it just gave me a headache. 
 as a side note: it's kind of stupid to rant about a book involving k-pop, so allow me to give myself some credibility. i've been a k-pop fan for a long-ass time. since before some of your oppas were even born. i started with shinhwa (and suffered their departure). i loved dbsk (and i witnessed with much heartbreak their departure). i fell in love with exo (and was absolutely heartbroken at the demise of exo-m...oh, luhan...;_;). 
 there may be a trend here. 
 in any case, i know my freaking k-pop. i've bopped to h.o.t's candy, and i danced along to bonamana. i attempted to do growl, but only ended up looking like a freakishly incompetent cowboy. i'm well-read on korean culture. i'm well up-to-date on k-pop current releases, and i consider myself, if not an expert, very, very well-informed on the k-pop scene. just keep me out of your flame wars. i ain't an elf, i ain't a cassie, i ain't a baby, leave me out of your drama. i'm here for the music. 
 since i'm accusing the main character of elements of racism, let me first be fair. let's address the huge fucking pink elephant in the room. korean culture, and k-pop, is not innocent when it comes to racism. i am not speaking for all koreans by any means, and i understand that every culture is guilty of feeling racially superior to some extent, but the k-pop world is peppered with racism, particularly when it comes to darker-skinned races and people. 
 this denigration of darker-skinned people is not limited to foreigners. even koreans who are darker-skinned get mocked (like the beautiful, golden-skinned kai of exo, who has been constantly given a hard time for his darker skin tone). snsd members have mocked a member whose skin is darker, calling her dirty-looking. there are rampant examples in which k-pop idols have dressed up in blackface (and nobody thinks anything of it), and there are numerous examples in which idols have made highly racist statements without any serious repercussion from society whatsoever. 
 so there you have it. racism does exist in south korea, but that's not to say we should emulate it. we should strive to be better. an eye for an eye is not the answer here. you cannot solve racism by being racist in return. 
 look, i'm not fucking mother theresa. i'm a jerk. so it should say something when i feel like we should maybe try to get along? 
 open k-pop discussion in the comments. go! 
 quotes were taken from an uncorrected proof subject to change in the final edition. 1.5 stars. 
 edit: changed the rating because it's gotten to the point where my sister and i have inside jokes on how stupid and shallow this book is. i can't think about this book without getting angry. 
 i have a history with pretentious people. 
 my biggest mess involved two boys in particular who were so incredibly full of themselves that for the first time in my life, i openly expressed my dislike to them. they know that i couldn't care less about their ""hotness"" or just how amazing they were. so goddamn full of themselves, spoiled rotten, just overall horrible people. 
 in short, my personality clashes with theirs entirely and there really is no chance of a friendship. i'd dive into it, but then this wouldn't be a book review. 
 and so i move on. 
 the fault in our stars is my first john green book. 
 yeah, i know, but i didn't really get into reading up until maybe four years ago. and i'm not too into contemporary, but the opportunity presented itself and i took my first dive. my sister is a fan of john green. she really loves looking for alaska and will grayson, will grayson and finds paper towns to be lfa's quirky new girl twin that doesn't own up. 
 i almost feel bad for disliking this book, but that's strictly on the idea of cancer. cancer is horrible, unpredictable, and the worst part is that it's your own cells mutating against you. that's why it's so hard to defeat. that's what i wish this book was about: dealing with the cancer that wants to kill you. instead, i get a book about a fictional miracle drug that keeps hazel alive so she can have a boy love her then die (not even on sight either) . 
 i came into this book with an open mind, i assure you. but i ended up really wanting to put the book down several times. from the first few pages, i felt something was actually wrong. like i didn't know what i was getting myself into. having finished this book, which, to me, was such a chore to do, i think i've stumbled upon decent reasons as to why i really can't give this any more than two stars. 
 if you didn't know by now, the fault in our stars tells the story of hazel, a girl whose thyroid cancer has ceased to grow thanks to a magical miracle drug. but because her cancer life is just so boring, a boy has to make it better. 
 because that is the only way anything gets better in life. 
 boyz. 
 cancer people, dear readers 
 writing 
 this was by far the largest problem i had. larger than hazel saying, ""i wanna tap that"" about augustus on page 8. this prose was not the voice of a real teenager. it tried, but this did not sound like a teenager suffering from cancer. this was the voice of a teenager who liked to say, ""you know what sucks? cancer. you know what else sucks? dying."" why? so the reader could laugh. 
 and wouldn't you know it every line is like that. there is no rest for any real emotion or interest. it's all laced with some one-liner or trying to be hilariously philosophical when it's just trying way too hard to keep a reader interested. and this alone, made me find great distaste in the character of hazel. 
 she is not believable because i never learned anything about her. she just hates support group and adores augustus for reasons that were never clarified throughout the book. oh you like gus's smile, his laugh? the idea that he thinks of basketball really as a nod to a baby toy? the idea that he spends money just so he can conduct a metaphor that doesn't do anything but make him look like a pretentious asshole? 
 oh who am i kidding. this entire book was shallow and pretentious. everyone thought they were so hilarious because did you know that eggs are restricted to a breakfast food? those poor scrambled eggs! no, i don't give a flying fuck about scrambled eggs and their apparent oppression. but think about it! we only have eggs for breakfast! because you choose to point it out as such. 
 or get this, how about the hurdles event in track? you know what augustus says about hurdles? he says this after that beautiful basketball connection to a child shoving cylinders into circle holes: 
 ""and i wondered if the hurdlers ever thought, you know, 'this would go faster if they just got rid of the hurdles.'"" 
 this is one of the stupidest things i have ever read in a book. 
 augustus waters, actual athlete, says something like this about a sport. sports are a very healthy way to escape stress. if anything, augustus and his philosophical ass should be wondering what the hurdles represent to the hurdlers. hurdles are a special event. the hurdlers are probably doing a running event too! they chose to run the hurdles for the challenge. 
 but this falls on the level of those scrambled eggs. hey! if we talk about this and make it sound funny, it'll be deep! it'll really scratch the heads of the readers! this just shows how silly and thoughtful augustus is! don't you guys just want to get with him and his awesome cigarette metaphor that he spends money on for no fucking reason? 
 guh, you fucking stupid ignorant son of a bitch. this was the line, by the way, that got me in that level of dislike for augustus that i got on with the asshole dudes that exist in my life. and hazel just sort of accepts this. like, what the hell is everyone thinking in this book? what universe are they in? because this is not a real universe. 
 i think now i'm tracking into character territory so here: 
 characters 
 hazel was the girl who referred to testicular cancer as ""cancer to the balls"" and then she sees augustus waters on page 8 of this book and goes, 
 ""look, let me just say it: he was hot. a nonhot boy stares at you relentlessly and it is, at best, awkward and, at worst, a form of assault. but a hot boy...well"" 
 remember, if you're not drop dead gorgeous, men, your nice glances are only awkward. that's it. you can never go farther, and your delicious insight on life will never win the heart of a girl. because you are just not sexy enough or augustinian for it. hazel likes to do this. she likes to put down other guys for her gus, even though they still barely knew each other. 
 i met kaitlyn and her (cute but frankly not augustinian) boyfriend for coffee one afternoon. 
 look at that. what. what is that? this was a nice guy and hazel's like, ""well he's not a fucking greek god so no thank you."" but what about augustus, hazel? you went to his house to watch a movie that you decided was just a silly boy movie that you knew you wouldn't like because you were a girl. movies don't work like that. what are you even doing! 
 you know what i just realized? hazel is a lot like mary in the forest of hands and teeth. she hates one thing and loves only one material thing. hazel hates the cancer support group, and loves an imperial affliction. mary hates the unconsecrated, but loves the ocean. that's all they have to their name. which is amazing to me that augustus finds something to love about hazel. all it is is her john green wit. 
 if you asked gus what else was there to hazel besides this one book thing and her wit, i bet you a hundred dollars that he would respond as derek in swan princess did with ""what else is there?"" 
 because that's all their love is. they're not bonding over the fact they have cancer. they bonded over an imperial affliction then experienced an intensified hey arnold! episode about visiting the author who, to no one's surprise i hope, was a complete jackass then makes a 180 because...because. who needs reasons. 
 however, the half star is devoted to mr. peter van houten, who was the only actual character in this book. everyone else was flat and pretentious assholes. when van houten did it, there was history behind it and a reason. he actually had an arc! he did things! despite my lack of care for augustus and hazel, the way peter treated them was abhorring and the only way for me to fix that was to stab the man in the eye. but he changed, and revealed why he acted the way he did and there was sense made and he was a good character. 
 structure 
 structure was fine. 
 still flowed okay despite my need to be done with this. 
 overall 
 i honestly thought everything was funny. i laugh at a loooooot of stuff. this, whatever this is, is not really that funny. it's shallow, and not really geared to people who want to know the world of cancer and stepping over the obstacle. it's a cancer-filled girl loving and losing a cancer-filled boy. oh and they meet their favorite author who's actually an asshole. cancer is the backseat, and i almost find it insulting. 
 i don't understand why people love this. tell me all you want that augustus is a beautiful boy and hazel just wanted something different in her life, but don't you dare tell me that this is deep. this is not a deep book, there's nothing that touches my heart except shallow wit and a poor man suffering from the cancerous death of his 8 year-old ray of sunshine. 
 i could go on, but i think this is enough. if it isn't, well that's your opinion. this is mine. you are just gonna have to deal. 
 final remarks: 
 this book should have been about what happened to peter van houten. 
 it'd be perfectly parallel to that hey arnold! episode i mentioned, but it'd be better than what i read. 
 or, this book should have been about hazel with the terminal cancer. because her inner conflict with cancer would better clash with her ability to be with augustus and it would've fleshed her out a hell of a lot more than giving her a magical miracle drug. they've done it again. threw my emotions onto a roller coaster ride into space and through wormholes and just every which way. 
 it was kind of exhausting reading this, but in such a good way. man. oh man <3 
 *edit* 
 third time reading this i listened to the audiobook. if you have the opportunity to experience it on audio (even both audio & physically read) i would recommend you do it. with a cast of characters and sound effects, the listening experience is epic. 
 the story is also pretty epic, too. these books kill me.

 i loved this! a review will be up on my channel on friday! the short 
 trigger warnings: anxiety, ocd 
 writing: 5 stars

 plot: 4.5 stars 
 originality: 4 stars 
 (all out of 5 stars) 
 the long 
 it's hard to believe i just read a new john green (jg from now on) book. my mind can't really wrap around that. (especially given where i was 5 years ago, not even knowing booktube existed, now i can't imagine my life without booktube and being hailey in bookland). but it was a pleasure to read his writing again. he is extremely talented. i was super nervous going into this admittedly. after the smash success of tfios i couldn't imagine a more high pressure situation. especially as i haven't absolutely loved all of his novels, i just didn't know where this one would fall for me. but i'm so happy that i loved it. it's definitely my favourite ya book on mental illness that i've ever read. 
 what sets jg apart and makes him, imo, a pioneer in the ya genre, is the fact that he writes knowledgable teenage characters. he doesn't discount teenagers as unintelligent due to their developing brains. he recognizes that teenagers, irl, are able to comprehend complex concepts. (this may seem obvious, but i read a book on writing books for young readers recently and it emphasizes the fact that you have to use the most simplistic language possible so young teenage minds can understand it. bs. teenagers are not dumb). 
 because of this, his characters are so startlingly relatable. i think aza is an especially relatable character for me with her struggles with anxiety. the way jg describes her experiences with anxiety spoke to me so intensely. specifically the metaphor of the spiral. blew my mind in all honesty. jg definitely has a talent for metaphors, i never get sick of it. he's always had a way of finding the perfect words to describe that which seems indescribable. seeing him use this technique regarding mental illness was fascinating. i think if you do, or ever have, suffered from mental illness, you will vastly appreciate his narrative. 
 i found this story to be very different than jg's other novels. not in a bad way at all, but the plot was much more subtle. there are two plots happening simultaneously really, one internally and one externally. you think you're following the one and then it turns out the other is the central focus. the way the two were interwoven was genius. 
 i think this has been written in a way that will appeal to both the next generation of ya readers as well as the aging generation of ya readers. typically jg's novels have the romance as a main focal point, and they really are some of my favourite romances, but here the romance takes a back seat. the front seat is occupied by aza's own personal mental health journey. it was such a nice change. (that's not to say there is no romance, it's there but it's just not the main topic). 
 overall, this made me so happy that john green is returning to the world of ya. it was the most authentic representation of mental illness i've ever read and i'm so glad i went in with an open mind. you can tell he is writing about something he's extremely familiar with. i can't wait to see what he comes out with next (i hope he has plans to write more!) hidden oracle 
 so fun and hilarious 
 i heart apollo 
 (a haiku book review in honor of the god of poetry) really impressed with this one! cute romance, funny dialogue, and the format/illustrations made this even more fun and unique. i also thought this book did a fantastic job at balancing the lightheartedness with the more serious stuff. personally, i could've done with a bit more resolution at the end--it felt a little rushed, and i would've liked to linger for a few more pages. also, there were some things that didn't quite add up when i stopped to think about them, but i was able to suspend my disbelief and just go with it. 
 overall, i thought this was a fantastic debut novel! funny and sad and romantic all at once! definitely recommended, especially if you like cute, unique contemporary. cassandra clare's extra jem & tessa story!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 after the bridge: the full story (jem/tessa) 
 http://cassandraclare.tumblr.com/post... 
 okay so i'm pretty sure anything i say will be a spoiler since everyone knows how hardcore i ship jem & tessa so my reading thoughts will be in the spoiler tag. 
 do not read it if you do not want to know what happens!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 also warning that the comments of this post now have spoilers. 
 i'm also going to start posting spoiler fan art there so keep away from the comments of this review until you finish reading. 
 you can dm me to discuss the spoiler stuff. 
 but keep calm jessa fans and wait for the epilogue :-d 
 dying to know what people think of the ending?!?!?! i don't know whether to love it or hate it. i mean it feels like a cheap ploy to keep both sides happy but i feel like i should just be happy with that. the epilogue is a jessa shippers dream come true! but even though it is technically a happy ending i was balling my eyes out through the entire book. i mean jem was so sweet, adorable, loving, selfless and perfect!!! he didn't want anyone to get hurt over him and just loved with all his heart. he is seriously like the most perfect character ever. <3 omg i love you james carstairs!!!! i cried when he found out about will's feelings and said he would have broken off the engagement. i cried when he said that he wanted tessa to grow to love will. i cried when he said he wanted to see charlotte's baby. i cried when he said silent brotherhood was his only choice. then i really seriously balled my eyes out when jem said goodbye to tessa and will. they had to live without him?!?!!? omg!!! then i as so happy during the epilogue that i cried some more. finally 130 years later he gets to have a happy life with tessa!!!!!!!!!!!! i wonder if we will get to see him and tessa together in the mortal instruments?! or the dark artifices?!?!?! i'm still kind of confused by the timelines of all this?! i believe mortal instruments is 2007 and the epilogue was 2008 so maybe a chance for dark artifices?! 
 so things that did piss me off. really?!?! jem was dying and tessa didn't sleep with him but right after they thought jem died she slept with will because she thought he might die?!?!?! and then at least after that they took time but i thought it was because will was giving tessa time to grieve and himself time to grieve but really he was just scared that tessa wouldn't love him like she did jem?! well of course not because jem is so much better than you! but whatever will died and now tessa is with jem!!!!! over all her lifetime with will and 71 years after his death she still never stopped loving jem or wearing his necklace!!!!!!!!!!! awwwwwwww!!! 
 favorite quotes - spoilers 
 ""i love you,"" she said. 
 he looked at her with a light in his thin face that made it more beautiful. ""wo xi wang ni ming tian ke yi jia gei wo."" 
 ""you..."" she drew her brows together. ""you want to get married? but we already are engaged. i do not thing on can get engaged twice."" 
 ""i said i would marry you tomorrow if i could."" 
 ""there will be another time,"" she said. ""another day, another dress. a time when you are well and everything is perfect."" 
 ""there is no such thing as prefect, tessa."" 
 foreshadowing to their future wedding that takes place after the epilogue?!?! 
 ""it is a strange thing, to be in love,"" he said. ""it changes you."" 
 ""zhe shi jie shang, wo shi zui ai ne de,"" he whispered. 
 she understood it. in all the world, you are what i love the most. 
 ""tessa, did you imagine that there exists any quarrel, large or small, that could make me stop loving you?"" 
 ""did you like it?"" he said. ""i could have given you...jewelry, but i wanted it to be something that was wholly yours. that no one else would hear or own. and i am not good with words, so i wrote how i felt about you in music."" he paused. ""did you like it?"" 
 ""then you did like it."" 
 ""it was like i saw your soul in the notes of the music. and it was beautiful."" 
 ""every heard has its own melody,"" he said. ""you know mine."" 
 ""i would give you everything of myself,"" he said. ""i would give you more in two weeks than most men would give you in a lifetime."" 
 ""when two people are as one in their inmost hearts, they shatter even the strength of iron or bronze."" 
 ""i can choose to be as much for her as i can be, to burn as brightly for her as i wish."" 
 ""you asked me if i have loved anyone but will,"" she said. ""and the answer is yes. i have loved you. i always have, and i always will."" 
 clockwork princess snippets! 
 tessa reached to brush the damp hair from his forehead. he leaned into her touch, his eyes closing. ""jem--have you ever--"" she hesitated. ""have you ever thought of ways to prolong your life that are not a cure for the drug?"" 
 at that his eyelids flew open. ""what do you mean?"" 
 she thought of will, on the floor of the attic, choking on holy water. ""becoming a vampire. you would live forever--"" 
 he scrambled upright against the pillows of the bed. ""tessa, no. don't--you can't think that way."" 
 ""is the thought of becoming a downworlder truly so horrible to you?"" 
 ""tessa ..."" he exhaled slowly. ""i am a shadowhunter. nephilim. like my parents before me. it is the heritage i claim, just as i claim my mother's heritage as part of myself. it does not mean i hate my father. but i honor the gift they gave me, the blood of the angel, the trust placed in me, the vows i have taken. nor, i think, would i make a very good vampire. [redacted for spoilers] i would no longer be will's parabatai, no longer be welcome in the institute. no, tessa. i would rather die and be reborn and see the sun again, than live to the end of the world without daylight."" 
 ""a silent brother, then,"" she said. 
 his eyes softened slightly. ""the path of silent brotherhood is not open to me."" 
 ----- 
 will's eyes met tessa's as she came closer, almost tripping again over the torn hem of her gown. for a moment, they were in perfect understanding. jem was what they could still look each other straight in the eye about. on the topic of jem, they were both fierce and unyielding. tessa saw will's hand tighten on jem's sleeve. ""she's here,"" he said. 
 jem's eyes opened slowly. tessa fought to keep the look of shock from her face. his pupils were blown out, his irises a thin ring of silver around the black. ""ni shou shang le ma, qin ai de?"" he whispered. ""are you hurt, my love?"" 
 omg what happened to jem?!?!?! cries! 
 ----- 
 ""wo wei ni xie de,"" he said, as he raised the violin to his left shoulder, tucking it under his chin. he had told her many violinists used a shoulder rest, but he did not: there was a slight mark on the side of his throat, like a permanent bruise, where the violin rested. 
 ""you -- made something for me?"" tessa asked. 
 ""i wrote something for you,"" he corrected, with a smile, and began to play. 
 ----- 
 ""though will was saying earlier,"" tessa added, ""that heroes all come to bad ends, and he could not imagine why anyone would want to be one, anyway."" 
 ""ah."" jem's hand squeezed hers briefly, and then let it go. ""well, will is looking at it from the hero's viewpoint, isn't he? but as for the rest of us, it's an easy answer."" 
 ""is it?"" 
 ""of course."" his voice was almost a whisper now. ""heroes endure because we need them. not for their own sakes. if will ..."" 
 ----- 
 ""you do not want to help us,"" will said to magnus. ""you do not want to position yourself as an enemy of mortmain's."" 
 ""well, can you blame him?"" woolsey rose in a whirl of yellow silk. ""what could you possibly have to offer that would make the risk worth it to him?"" 
 ""i will give you anything,"" said tessa in a low voice that will felt in his bones. ""anything at all, if you can help us help jem."" 
 magnus gripped a handful of his black hair. ""god, the two of you. i can make inquiries. track down some of the more unusual shipping routes. old molly --"" 
 ""i've been to her,"" will said. ""something's frightened her so badly she won't even crawl out of her grave."" 
 woolsey snorted. ""and that doesn't tell you anything, little shadowhunter? is it really worth all this, just to stretch your friend's life out another few months, another year? he will die anyway. and the sooner he dies, the sooner you can have his fiancee, the one you're in love with."" he cut his amused gaze toward tessa. ""really you ought to be counting down the days till he expires with great eagerness."" 
 who is this woolsey douchebag and where is he so i can shove my foot up his ass?!

 loved this book, read it in 2012 but decided to come back and write a review for it. this is actually the book that made me start book blogging! february 25, 2013 
 dear charlie, 
 i am writing to you because i feel like you're the only one that would listen to me right now. from all the friends that i have made you are the one that's the most understanding. i guess what i'm trying to do is thank you for being there for me these last couple of days. i didn't expect to learn from you as much as i have. my mom always says that you can never really understand a person until you walk in their shoes, but i guess getting to know you and reading your story did just that. i have to say you have stripped me from any prejudice i might have had. and i am truly sorry if i had any. you showed me that no matter what happens, what we experience, we always have a right to feel the way we feel, just because. you showed me the purity of feelings, beauty of thoughts, generosity of love and warmth of friendship. you made me appreciate books and poetry more, and see the impact they have on people's lives. for that you will always hold a special place in my heart. i'd like to think that you get better, i hope one day you can be honest with people you love, be who you really are and do what you want to do. most importantly i hope that you will love the real sam and not just the idea of her and be ready for her to love you back. i hope we can see each other some day, i'll make sure to come back and remind myself of everything that is you, tho i hope to never forget. 
 love always

 ladies - it's time to cut the cord on this and write some new shit. le doy 5 estrellas porque yo soy el autor, perdonen el egocentrismo. 4.5/5 
 great book! slowish start but really picked up in the middle and had an epic ending! 4.5 stars, reeeaaally close to being a 5 star book for me! this was so awesome and engaging, i had trouble putting it down to take breaks for food and sleep! and this is so not a standalone. i'm glad the sequel is officially happening, because i need more! 
 i thought both main characters were great. i did prefer elias' chapters because they were more action packed, though laia went through some excellent character development! as for secondary characters/the romances, i wasn't a huge fan of keenan, but i loved helene! i can't wait to see how this develops in future books because we are definitely getting another book yay. 
 overall, this was an awesome read! probably the best debut novel i've read in a while, and i'm really looking forward to discussing this in the liveshow! wow. halfway through this book i thought i had it all figured out. i was very very wrong in a very very good way. this book was touching and thoughtful and man oh man, does it pack an emotional punch. awesome debut, definitely recommended, and i'm looking forward to reading more by adam silvera in the future! fantastic conclusion to this duology! this series has such a great balance of adventure and romance, and i just love all the history and the beautiful writing! at times i did feel that the pacing was a little off, there were some slow parts, but overall i thoroughly enjoyed this duology. and while this story was complete and i'm very satisfied with it, i still want more! a sequel, a prequel, a spin-off, different characters, whatever -- i just adore this world and this society of time travelers and i could totally go for more! 
 if you want a duology that features time travel and romance and adventure, with lovely writing, a colorful cast of secondary characters, and a satisfying conclusion -- check this one out! obviously i'm biased . . . but this book changed my life ;-) before you enter the world of caraval, you must remember that it's all a game . . . 
 4.5 stars. i'm very impressed with this book. the most important thing you need to know is that, although it's marketed as such, it really isn't a competition per se. i mean, it's as much a competition as the night circus is. 
 sure, it's a game indeed, a treacherous game that you can lose yourself in at any moment, but it's not a competition. i'm not going to elaborate, because i'd have to reveal some things that will spoil some surprises, so you'll just have to trust me on that. 
 but it's good, so good. it plays with the reader so well. it's not only scarlett who risks her life to win the game, it's also us, or so i felt. i felt as i were a player myself. sometimes characters are clueless and don't see what is in front of them while we readers scream our heads off trying to make them see. this never happens in this book. because whenever scarlett learns something, we learn it too. 
 the reader in me can't help but try to guess what has happened and who that character is and what the characters will face in the future, etc. i just can't help myself. and so that's what i did. but even though i kept trying to have things figured in my mind before the main character ever could, i still ended up being delightfully surprised. 
 what really shines in this book is the action. every new chapter brings a new setting or mishap or character: the story progresses well. sometimes scenes can be lethargic because of an exaggerated amount of description, but that too never happens in caraval. 
 what stole my heart was the magical, fairytale-esque writing style and narration. though it obviously is a young adult novel - no cross-genre going on - i didn't mind that it wasn't more sexy or ghastly. 
 it's very worth reading if you're a fan of fantasy novels, uncanny and treacherous stories and thrilling, intelligent plots.

 and you will love it. 4.5 stars. for those of you who donaeur(tm)t know, i had the opportunity to moderate sarahaeur(tm)s raleigh event last night. in addition to that, i spent some time with her talking about her inspiration and the way she approached the disability representation. i have a lot to share, so bear with me here. you can also view this post on my blog here. 
 first of all, iaeur(tm)ve seen a lot of unfair accusations thrown her way. iaeur(tm)m not here to defend everything, and everyoneaeur(tm)s experience will be different, so please keep that in mind as you read this review. also please remember that discussion is great, but please keep it kind and civil! 
 and also, i want to give a big shout out to sarah and the team at bloomsbury for taking care of me and making me feel so welcome! i canaeur(tm)t say enough positive things about my experience. you guys are amazing. 
 moving on! 
 new culture with the southern continents 
 one of the highlights of my evening was getting to ask sarah about her inspiration for the southern continents. her answer actually really surprised me, and iaeur(tm)m excited to pass it along. sarah mentioned she spent a long time reading and researching ghengis kahn, and spent a long time in front of the audience describing how he ran his empire. despite being seen as a aeur~villainousaeur(tm) figure in history, his empire was founded on the acceptance of all religions. she talked a lot about how he valued education and reading and such. iaeur(tm)ve seen people throw the aeur~culture appropriation without researchaeur(tm) accusation at sarah, but she credits ghengis kahn in the end of her book, and it was really neat to hear about the time and effort she spent studying him. 
 also, chaol is the only white person in the whole book (unless iaeur(tm)m missing something), and the new cultures and characters were such a breath of fresh air. a majority of the book is spent world building and the development of new characters that will play vital roles in the next installment. i canaeur(tm)t speak to the accuracy of how these characters are represented, but i really loved how strong and courageous they are. i donaeur(tm)t want to go into too much detail, but the southern continents are lead by the khagan and his royal family. the new princes and princesses are all so cool, and they easily became my favorite characters. there are also ruk riders which i wonaeur(tm)t touch too much on, but holy crap, they are going to bring a whole new level of epic to the series. 
 chaol + disability representation (spoilers in the last paragraph) 
 this is such a touchy subject, and i was debating whether or not to share my feelings towards the matter. but *breathes heavily* here we go. as you can see by my photos, i have some experience with being in a chair. some days i am able to walk, but more often than not, i simply donaeur(tm)t have the strength to stand, or iaeur(tm)m too dizzy or sick due to the disease iaeur(tm)m battling. so my experience isnaeur(tm)t the same as others in the disabled community, and iaeur(tm)m speaking for myself and my personal experiences here. but i do know pain. i know what it's like to be unable to move for days at a time, to be brushed aside or seen as less of a person. 
 i was nervous to see how this would be handled. as you know from queen of shadows, chaol lost the use of his legs. he can't move them or even feel them. heaeur(tm)s in a wheelchair. yep, you heard meaeur| a fantasy hero in a wheelchair. 
 he begins the journey as very resentful and upset and it takes him a long time to come to terms with what has happened to him not only physically, but emotionally. a lot of people accuse his character of being aeur~ruinedaeur(tm) and trampled on. i disagree. his attitude and outlook are totally and completely (and painfully) relatable to me personally. i hate having to rely on others. i hate not being able to get up and take care of myself. it's so difficult to not see myself as aeur~lessaeur(tm) of a person because iaeur(tm)m not always able to do simple things. the first time i was in a wheelchair in public, wellaeur| it came as a bit of a shock to me. it's almost like being invisible, or like you have some type of contagious disease. people either give you sad looks or avoid looking at you altogether. you're skipped in line, tripped over, and ignored in many cases. (thereaeur(tm)s so much more i could add to this but iaeur(tm)m going to refrain for now.) 
 iaeur(tm)m generally positive, but on the hard days, it really is difficult. it's easy to fall into the aeur~iaeur(tm)m uselessaeur(tm) or aeur~i donaeur(tm)t understand why this happened to meaeur(tm) pit of despair. as you read through chaolaeur(tm)s emotional path to healing, keep in mind that these are feelings people battle every single day. not to mention, sarah goes in depth about the actual physical struggles of chaolaeur(tm)s movements (more on this below.) 
 ""he knewaeur""chaol realized the guard knew just how it felt to have the chair touched, moved, without being asked."" 
 i had the chance to talk to sarah about this face to face. i told her i finished, and i thanked her for how she handled chaol. guys, she broke down in tears in front of me. iaeur(tm)ve never seen this type of dedication from an author to a disabled character in a fantasy novel. she shared how she spent months with sensitivity reader(s), and a little bit about her journey writing chaol this way, and why she chose to end it the way she did. i canaeur(tm)t even begin to describe to you all what it meant to see this in a book, to read his journey and how raw and honest it was. the accuracy and detail was astounding. sarah went above and beyond. watch my review video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fa3rl... 
 watch my interview with morgan matson here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvqhe... 
 morgan matson definitely did not disappoint with this book! filled with books, dogs, ice cream, scavenger hunts, and a swoon-worthy new romantic interest, clark, the unexpected everything was an addictive read. i love the message of this book, learning how to live in the moment, and all of the characters were strong and (some of them) easy to love. also clark. what a babe. a nerdy, beautiful babe. 
 i definitely recommend this and all of morgan matson's other books, especially during summer! thirteen reasons why i hate this book. 
 note, 6/10/17: tape #11 has been updated. 
 https://emmareadstoomuch.wordpress.co... 
 alright. i really thought i wasn't going to review this book. but a status sharing certain anti-anti 13 reasons why sentiments (did that make sense?) just came up onto my timeline, and i, to put it cordially, fucking snapped. 
 let me preface this by saying: if this book or television show helped you in any way, this review is not for you. we all have our coping mechanisms, we all have our favorite books - i am absolutely not here to shit on anyone's fave. if you liked this book, that's good. please don't read this. i reserve the right not to be nice to you if you comment on this saying i'm being unfair. 
 so. there are two sides to this debate. one side thinks this book and the son of satan television show it spawned is inspiring, important, other positive i-words. the other side - the side of my brethren, which is, unsurprisingly to anyone who follows me on here, staggeringly outnumbered - disagrees. i'm going to try to outline for you why i feel that way. 
 disclaimer: if this at any point seems like i'm telling you you're not allowed to be a fan of this shit, i'm not. but i passionately hate it, so don't expect objectivity. also, this contains spoilers for both the book and the show, of course. 
 let's get started. i'll organize this by my very own thirteen reasons. 
 tape #1: the book and the show donaeur(tm)t bring attention to mental illness. 
 thataeur(tm)s one of the biggest defenses iaeur(tm)ve seen of this story. that yes, itaeur(tm)s triggering and yes, itaeur(tm)s intense and yes, itaeur(tm)s hard to talk about. but itaeur(tm)s important. 
 hereaeur(tm)s the thing: hannah baker is not a mentally ill character. this book gave me way too many feelings. i'd go from laughing at a cute scene to crying at a sad scene in a matter of minutes. it was like emotional whiplash (in a good way!) 
 i flew through this book over the course of a day and when i wasn't reading, i was thinking about when i could get back to reading. the characters were all so real and flawed, and they're in such a complicated situation. my heart just ached for all of them. i also particularly loved the dual timeline. it was perfectly woven together in a way that fleshed out the complexities of this situation while really ramping up the tension. i can already tell that this is a book that will stay with me for a long time. 
 if you're looking for a story that fully embraces the messiness of love and loss in a heart-wrenching and realistic way--this is it. read this. edit on january 9th, 2016: i haven't thought about this book since i read it in july and i really have no interest anymore in reading the rest of the series. 
 ---------- 
 it definitely was a slow moving book, but the plot really held my attention and i loved the use of the pictures. sometimes i felt like he tried a little too hard to make the pictures perfectly fit into the story which made it a little awkward to read, but they still made the reading experience more interesting. the book really read like a movie and i can't wait to see how tim burton's interpretation is going to turn out! well i like it -\_(tsu)_/- 
 edited to add: if you're in need of a serious recap of passenger before you read wayfarer, check this out: https://static1.squarespace.com/stati... now that this book is written and edited and out in 2 months, i guess it's time to finally mark it as read <3 loved it but it needed more percy just saying i just realized i hadn't rated this. dur. 
 oh, wow. loved this book. angel books are hard to do and this one is the best. and kaidan? can i lick him? heck, i'll lick wendy. okay. maybe shouldn't have written that. this is why i don't do reviews. le sigh. *edit* 
 full review here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxqbq... 
 i don't even know what to say... i'm sure the words will come, and at that point i'll try to film a review. but for now i'll just think about a million and one things. 
 my gosh <3 
 review copy provided by publisher in exchange for an honest review. this was such a heartbreakingly honest account of what is happening in america right now. as a white reader, the experience this story affords its readers cannot be taken for granted. inspired by the black lives matter movement, this book takes you into the heart of garden heights after the main character has witnessed the wrongful murder of her best friend khalil by a police officers. being canadian, as well as being white, i have the privilege of not having to deal with any of the things starr deals with on a day to day basis but the experience of being alongside her as she grappled with the injustice of it all gave me a completely new understanding of what is going on in america. i obviously am not ignorant to it all, but this just felt like an honest firsthand account. it really is indescribable. this is such an important read and i highly encourage you to pick it up. 
 i will do a full spoiler free review and spoiler discussion on my channel very soon. a book lover always wants to read one of their favorite books for the first time again....oblivion is a way to do that with obsidian <3 i really enjoyed this! it was shorter than i expected, and didn't have as strong a story arc as the other books of the lunar chronicles, but it was fascinating getting to know levana's backstory. seeing things from her pov got me to sympathize with her, but it also made me realize just how twisted she is. she's definitely not a likable character, but i do understand her better now. i also better understand the dynamics between levana and cinder and winter, which was great! 
 i think the best reading order would be publication order (cinder, scarlet, cress, fairest, winter) just because fairest has some minor spoilers for the previous books. and while you could probably skip fairest and still be able to thoroughly enjoy the lunar chronicles, it was still a very interesting and captivating read (i flew through it in one sitting!) 
 bottom line: definitely recommended if you like the lunar chronicles! it was gripping, dark, and just plain fascinating to get a closer look at such a twisted character. 3.5-4 stars? i can't decide just yet! 
 i decided to reread this book, as i am about to continue on with the series, finally! 
 i did really enjoy this the second time round, but found myself a little more critical of a few things. i will be doing a full video review of this soon, so look forward to more of my thoughts then :) really loved this book and it's story because i personally have never heard about this side of the war before and i'm so grateful i know about it now. loved this book! such a phenomenal retelling of snow white! ** spoiler alert ** 
 remember when you were about twelve, and you saw all those cool kids with scene hair writing maudlin poetry into their death note notebooks? i do. come on, guys. let's be honest here. about 85% of us had an emo phase at around that time, and i'm not going to mince around in my overpriced sweatpants and lie about it. 
 i was such a fucking dork when i was twelve. i kid you not: i tried to write a screenplay. what the ever loving fuck was i thinking? then i got into video games in a big way, all those weird japanese nomura concoctions and then for a harrowing six-month window between twelve and thirteen, i was a weeaboo. raise your hand if you ever felt personally victimized by my emo bangs. (put your hands down immediately, you dicks.) 
 that was when i hit my fanfiction stride. it lasted for a while. like, maybe a couple of years. i used to post this rambling corny horseshit all over deviantart (i was afraid of fanfiction.net) and then i came across this person who, at nearly thirty years old, was still writing fanfiction for magical girl anime. and it was that traditional, full-frontal, badly-punctuated fanfiction, too. 
 i sat back slowly, and i thought this: what if, at thirty, i'm still writing this dreck? what if i get so wedged in this rabbit hole of bad fanfic that i never actually produce anything original, or of substance? well, halo embodies every trap i was afraid of falling into, at fourteen years old. it is some of the most obnoxious, insane, shittily-written claptrap i have ever read in my life. that one star up there? unintended comedic value. that's what that's for. 
 the writing is abhorrently, almost insultingly bad. it makes me hurt to think that someone read this sentence, ""it's usually pretty chill around here except things have been a bit weird lately"" and decided that there was no way the world could live without the craft of adornetto. like, is macmillan for real with this? i just... what the fuck is that. 
 i feel like this book has some kind of vendetta against punctuation. it's like it's making an occupy ya protest against correct grammar. either that or it's a personal attack against people who give a shit about where question marks go. for example: 
 there should have been a question mark at the end of this sentence: ""yes, but what if they think i'm weird."" 
 but there should not have been a question mark at the end of this sentence: 
 ""i can't believe that stuff really interests you?"" 
 do you see what i mean? also, i had to read this sentence, ""a door slammed and a girl with brown curls pulled back from her face with a headband appeared"" about six times before it made any sense. 
 there's also this: ""in my dress i resembled a column of shimmering moonlight."" 
 ""i resembled a column of shimmering moonlight"". 
 ""a column of shimmering moonlight"". 
 ""a column of shimmering moonlight."" 
 honest to god, it's this bad. it is an absolute piss-take. this book honestly does have to be seen to be believed. and it's bad enough that the dialogue is murderously cheesy (""you can't be..."" ""an angel? jackpot."" or, even worse: ""holy crap!"" ""would you mind not blaspheming?"") but the plot is just 
 nah. 
 there's nothing to say about the plot. because it isn't there. there is no plot to speak of. it is absent. non-existent. there has been a mass plot exodus. 
 it's kind of like the inn of the sixth happiness or paranormal activity. you have to wade through an entire sinkhole of wobbly black nothingness to get to some actual substance, and when you think you've finally unearthed something, anything to validate the existence of this story, it slips from thine desperate hands. and then you're left standing there alone, covered in shit, wondering where your time went. and your fucking money, too. look, macmillan: if i wanted to spend my money on a turd, i would buy a turd. don't try and gaslight me with this. 
 but the thing is that i'm not exaggerating. for the first 300 or so pages, bethany swoons. and that's it. and it's not like xavier is attractive, or anything. in fact, he's fucking horrible. horrible like mel gibson or johnny depp. we're told that xavier has such a good heart, and yet he shits all over bethany from the greatest height. i honestly do not understand how anyone can find this controlling, vindictive, obsessive, domineering, creepy, cruel, misogynistic, condescending, chauvinistic, stupid and absurd boy attractive. how? how? someone explain to me what the allure of xavier is. please. 
 let's just pare it back a little and take a closer look. let's put xavier under the microscope. case in point: 
 ""i knew that if i wanted to keep my entire world from falling apart, i would have to keep xavier."" (217) 
 ""entrusted to look after me by gabriel and ivy"" (247) 
 ""he was the one who reminded me to drink plenty of water and the one who deflected questions about my family from curious classmates. he even took it upon himself to answer for me one day when mr. collins asked why i hadn't managed to finish my homework by the due date."" 
 ""i knew that if it slipped my mind, xavier would complete it for me and hand it in without my knowledge."" (248) 
 ""he became fiercely protective whenever anybody he didn't approve of came within a two-foot radius of me."" (248) 
 ""what's wrong with him?"" i asked crossly. ""he seems nice enough."" 
 ""he's not your type of person."" 
 ""why?"" 
 ""you ask a lot of questions, don't you?"" (248) 
 ""her business is my business."" (249) 
 ""i'm not hungry. gabriel always cooks a big breakfast."" 
 ""here, eat this,"" he commanded and pushed a health bar across the table."" (251) 
 ""xavier chuckled as he told me the story, amused by the irrational antics of the females in his family."" (253) 
 if nobody can see the controlling, obsessive and downright abusive nature of those quotes above, then i give up. i surrender. i have no more fucks to give, here. the field in which i grow my fucks is barren. all i can say is that xavier is a very frightening, very twisted rape fantasy. you may balk, ""rape fantasy? he never shows any signs of sexually assaulting bethany!"" 
 rape culture runs so much deeper than bare-faced sexual assault. rape culture is the ultimate snake in the grass. it thrives on the encompassing control and subordination of women, the propagation of gender roles (strong and dependable man, weak and stupid woman) so that, when a woman is raped or treated in any derivative way of rape, it is shrugged off as ""just a man fulfilling his needs"" or ""she was asking for it"" or ""she's hysterical/delusional/overreacting"" or ""what a crazy bitch, she should calm down"". bethany is coddled and roughed around like a toy, or an accessory on xavier's arm. everything they do is on xavier's terms. it is what he wants, when he wants it, and bethany is so in awe of him that she allows him to treat her like chattel. it made me feel dirty while i was reading it. 
 there is something so twisted and base about the idolization of a love interest like this. what exactly is wrong with society and media that we would actually endorse this behaviour? and what is wrong with those people who say that the feminist movement has done her job and is out of work, and that fighting for socioeconomic equality is old hat? 
 who are those people? are they misogynists, or just blind to the fact that characters like xavier are not characters at all: they are wish fulfillment devices. meaning that folk out there have been taught to wish for a submissive role in a relationship with a prince who will not only sweep them off their feet, but take them home after the party, cut off their landline connection and create a press frenzy. it's exactly the sort of patriarchal shite that caused the disgusting culture of blame around the steubenville rape case, and that plucked johnny depp off the hook after he beat the shit out of his wife. all over the internet are turgid white men screaming, ""amber heard wants money!"" but if she fucking wanted money, mate, then why did she donate every penny of her divorce settlement to charity? hm, i wonder! 
 but all of this is just window dressing for my favorite quote of the entire book: ""for this evening at least, feminist philosophy had been abandoned, and the girls, like fairy-tale princesses, let themselves be lead up the flight of steps into the foyer."" 
 i just love this. i love it. first of all, it acts as though feminist philosophy is about two things: not wearing dresses and not touching men. also, feminists are against fun. they're against anything traditionally feminine. that's why the feminists threw me out of their club. because my hair is pink and my clothes are pretty and i like platform sneakers. 
 i would tackle the other characters because i haven't yet, but what's the fucking point? ivy barely has a pulse. gabriel is just an imprint of xavier, but in a creepy brotherly role rather than a sexual one, and bethany is like a big piece of glittery cardboard. molly is just a placeholder to praise bethany's virginity. and jake is so incredibly random that i'm averse to even calling him a character. what is he? what exactly is going on with him? he's obviously from the uk (i'm not sure where in the uk he's from because he's got a ""british accent"", which is so laughably vague, but since you're making it so broad, i have a headcanon that he's got that really broad glasgow accent that makes everything sound overly cheerful) because everybody there is evil, right, and he has this tattoo and he rides a motorbike and he's so scandalous. if i had pearls, i'd be clutching them! (i hate pearls. they creep me out. i don't want hard oyster poops threaded on a string and hanging around my neck! what do you take me for?) 
 there's also the hilarious physical description of him. his eyes are described as ""cat-green"". i may be mistaken, but i'm pretty sure that cats aren't green! 
 man, was i wrong! i must be. i'm a feminist. stop laughing, feminists! you're not allowed to have fun. 
 as it nears the end, the overall quality of this book really goes down the crapper. at one point, molly, gabriel and beth are having this cozy little chat in the kitchen and when molly agonizes over her weight, gabriel basically snaps his fingers in her face and says, ""eat, bitch."" 
 now, don't get me wrong. we went over this with the whole ""beach body"" debacle. it was fatphobic bollocks. but this book is shallower than a teaspoon; molly and gabriel talk about this hot teen issue in such a skin-crawly stilted way and i just didn't believe it. i felt like i was receiving a direct lecture from the author, and that doesn't cut it for me. that's not enough to convince me that i don't need to diet. 
 and anyway, the subliminal messaging in this book just totally negates this. we have this nonsense about inner beauty, in the middle of a book where every single character on team good is stunningly beautiful. bethany says not to invite xavier in, because she looks a mess. what? you just gave us a lecture on the value on inner loveliness, and yet you base your entire book on a relationship that places physical beauty on the highest possible bullshit pedestal, having bethany chatter on and on about how hot xavier is, how beautiful angels are, and how she couldn't live without xavier's eyes or muscles or what have you. it's this kind of absurd, shallow, wishy-washy bullshit that gives ya such horrible press. it completely ruins it for the good books. 
 to conclude? this is shallow, unbelievable, pretentious tripe with a really fucking bleak moral background. i hate bethany, and xavier, and jake. i hate ivy, too, this maudlin useless doormat whose personal mission apparently consists of chaining herself to the kitchen and the church. phantom and alice add nothing to the story and are just plot devices so that bethany's sickly sweet nature can win our stony hearts. what a base, filthy character she is. i can't stand her. if i met her, i'd slap the shit out of her. 
 there is no plot to this book. a good editing job could have sliced it down to about 150 pages, and even then the watery excuse for a villain and bethany's perfection would still have made me barf into my hair. why did 'our father' (the fuck?) send the 'agents of light' to an english-speaking upper middle class town where everybody is getting on with their lives just fine? 
 how convenient, no? how fortunate for bethany to have arrived in a place where she can fall in 'love' with a rich white boy with a nice family and perfect health. the brutal thing about this book is that it was almost a cool idea, and if it had been executed better it could have been awesome. for example, both race and crosses in class and tradition could have been explored if a little more thought had been put into it. what if bethany and her cohorts had been sent to a remote area of old-timey sub-saharan africa where bethany has to juggle both her good deeds and growing love for a male tribe member? what if bethany had been entered into a war zone where she had to save the people from constant threats of violence while gradually being drawn to a young soldier on the opposing side? what moral dilemma would this pose? 
 it's not hard to think outside the box - or at least it shouldn't be. books, especially those aimed at young people, have extraordinary power. young minds are like sponges, and if you're standing up on a podium and lighting this sort of sexist garbage fire, then what are you doing with your social responsibility? you're making a mockery of it. today's ya does not even have to reflect the depth of 1984 or a tale of two cities; it just has to matter. if it doesn't, then what's the point? i could learn more about the value of love and healthy body image by watching say yes to the dress. and that show is also a garbage fire. 
 one star for unintentional comedy. and that is all. it's release day, so i can finally talk about my dislike for this book! it's been a few months since i read it, so my feelings (and outrage) are no longer super fresh, but i'll do my best. 
 i found this book to be sooo boring and difficult to read, what with the ridiculous character names and dull plot. i had tons of issues with the plot and pacing when i was reading the book, and i really had to force myself to pick it up. the characters were also completely one dimensional and a bore to read about, so really i couldn't find anything to like about the book. 
 with those issues on top of all of the problematic aspects of the story that tons of people have brought up, i have no issues with giving this book 1 star. please someone tell me there is a second book. this one was so good but i want moreeeee! like i want to know what josh's future holds!! i want more! ** spoiler alert ** 
 yes, i do get that the main character's racist perspective is obviously supposed to be an attempt to highlight the horrible views of those who raised her. yes, i get that this book is probably supposed to be the story of a naive, sheltered girl overcoming internalized prejudice. i will address all of this in a bit because it reallllly didn't work for me. 
 ok so brief (ha, lies. nothing here will be brief) overview of the story first: 
 elloren's grandmother was the black witch who was actually horrible and killed thousands of people to ""save"" her people, but elloren's been raised on the rhetoric of the oppressors. she's living with her uncle in a small town because he's trying to keep her powers a secret and away from the schemes of her aunt & the council. it's obvious to the reader that elloren has her grandmother's super special power, but she's the definition of clueless and spends most of the book walking around wide-eyed & confused like she was born yesterday. 
 their religion wants kids to get wandfasted (basically an arranged marriage) as young teens and have their racial purity tested. elloren's aunt is determined to have her wandfasted to the most handsome and eligible guy ever, but the uncle sends elloren to university and makes her promise not to wandfast to anyone for two years. 
 the all kids go to magic school, where elloren continues to spew racist nonsense. the school is made up of kelts, elves, fae in disguise, icarals with wings, and a couple lupine. there are characters with literally every color skin like pink, lavender, or green. and it seems like a typical fantasy book except now everyone's reduced to their race in the most simplistic way. 
 the story goes to seriously absurd lengths to put elloren in in sad situations... a mean girl keeps harassing and tripping her with magic, her coworkers in the kitchen physically abuse and mock her, and she's assigned to live in a remote tower with a girl who tries to kill her the first night. it seriously gets ridiculous. the story just tries so, so hard to make her the underdog and it gets beyond annoying: 
 ""i can't leave verpax universry because i'm at risk of being killed by a demonic, monstrous, wingless icaral. and i have no alternative but to live with two demonic, monstrous winged icarals and work in a place where people want to break my arms and legs."" 
 the behavior of the classmates who harass elloren is such an absurd over-the-top caricature of cruelty that it didn't even feel like girl hate anymore... it just felt like bad writing. it was so painful to make it through this book on so many different levels. 
 the next couple hundred pages could be summed up as: everyone hates everyone else. gardnerian and kelt students won't go into a classroom where a lupine student is sitting, the lupine twins hate the gardnerians, apparently the icaral hate the lupine, and on and on. i could honestly fill a review with the horrific things elloren goes around thinking and saying about everyone. and she keeps calling people ""half-breeds"" even though she gets indignant at the ""slur"" when someone refers to her that way. 
 i couldn't stand how the pain of others in this book almost always becomes a prop for some super basic growth and a pat on the back for elloren. 
 elloren's self-centered, oblivious pov is infuriating to read through because she has no common sense whatsoever and her entire petty personality can be summed up as self-pity. she has such a victim complex and is one of the most irritating characters i have ever found. so many of her thoughts and actions make zero sense and she reads like she's 12 instead of 17. i'm not sure if the reader is meant to hate her or not, but there is truly nothing likable about her. 
 elloren doesn't start really considering that the ""evil one"" stuff in her religion might be wrong until page 350... but then she still continues to be dumb. it's beyond tiresome. the next couple hundred pages are cringeworthy efforts for the students from different cultures to try to understand the religions and customs of other students. there are six pages of ""uncomfortably blunt questions"" about lupine mating, with both parties judging the other for stuff that feels iffy at best. the writing is just extremely clunky, juvenile, and awkward to say the least. 
 eventually her friend has the genius breakthrough of ""i'm finding i like meeting new people... people different from me. i'm tired of being afraid of everyone."" the whole thing feels like a children's book that talks down to the reader. and so many of elloren's thoughts are just whyyyyy. 
 the love interest spends most of the book glaring at elloren in fifty shades of anger... his sole method of communication is his ""stormy eyes."" there is zero chemistry or feels there, but that's the least of this book's issues. it really just kept getting worse and worse as it went. example: towards the end they go to rescue a selkie woman who was being abused/imprisoned by a guy as a sex slave and that entire episode is just there as a gold star for elloren. it's white savior stuff all around and handled so unbelievably poorly. 
 i cannot even explain how weak the meandering plot becomes by the end. some cliche fantasy ideas are just scattered around without any relevance to this particular story. i guess the next book will actually get into the plot about the white wand, elloren's power, the resistance, and the whole... story? this entire book could be summed up as ""girl in a wide-eyed trance acts like an idiot for 600 pages."" there was seriously nothing to support or even like. this book had potential, too! i mean, the fall tournament sounded cool. so did elloren's dream to be an apothecary that was mentioned on the back cover. but school was mostly a vehicle for a montage of hateful scenes. 
 the plot tries to deal with some very serious issues, but barely carries through on anything. the end is a brief, poorly written mess. and elloren is still just as naive and dim as ever. page 547 is her first and only true apology (to a woman who works in the kitchen): ""i'm sorry i was so ignorant."" she also tells a little girl that she ""didn't want to be mean"" and that she isn't anymore. and that's that, folks. 
 i deleted most of the example quotes that i had in here because the review got too long, but they were seriously horrible. and maybe some reviewers think that makes me weak for not being able to handle the ""real world"" where people are racist, but... i'm here to have fun. that's not entertainment. 
 but i don't even want to spend more time complaining about the poor execution & writing, the weak and petty characters, how simplistic everything was, etc because it just doesn't matter when compared to the fact this was hundreds of pages of unchecked hatred and intolerance. the book hit every single offensive topic in the most blatant way that it was clearly trying to show all of the possible things you could think that are wrong. and the author put all of those horrible, painful comments out there without really addressing it in the end. 
 i couldn't handle how all of the pain in this book was thrown around cavalierly for the sake of the main character's development. it's all about her struggles. if this story is supposed to be about a character unlearning prejudice, then we need to see something from the side of the oppressed as well. they only felt like props in this girl's painfully slow growth. 
 if you took all of the racism, sexism, ableism, homophobic comments, and general idiocy out of this book it would probably be 50 pages long and just the intro to a story. i get that the author was trying to provide ample room for character growth here by having the character start out so ignorant. i'm not misunderstanding the intent; i'm saying it really did not work for me in this case. i get that this first book is setting up the rest of the series and the author wanted elloren to unlearn what she's been taught first, but i don't think the way it's approached is remotely acceptable. 
 the entire book turned into a narrative on racism and prejudice but felt offensively hollow because the elves, lupine, etc are obviously ""others."" the book needed waaaaay more worldbuilding in order to parallel racism in a way that's not so incredibly irresponsible and ignorant. i thought the simplistic way that everyone hated each other (and even elloren's flimsy ""awakening"") felt like something out of a children's picture book but was placed in the context of a full fantasy world that lacked the necessary complex history and explanation of power dynamics in order to feasibly depict racism. <--- that is probably my main thought. sorry it took so long to get there. 
 anyways, it was just irritating, insulting, and painful to read. i do not want to sit through 600 pages of an idiot mc coming to learn that ""racism is bad."" i hit the character limit in my review and can't elaborate on this but ughh we live in a world with enough hate. let's have fantasy worlds where readers can see themselves instead of feeling even more alienated. 
 and for the people who say ""it's just fiction, relax"" (because i know i'll get comments like this)... no. fiction shapes how we view our world, ourselves, and everyone around us. there is no disconnect. 
 it's kind of hard to be one of the first reviewers because there's nothing to gauge your reaction against and people who were excited about the book get angry that you've ""ruined"" it. i've only seen a few reviews so far from actual readers and they mostly adore this book. so all i can do is share my honest reaction and then wait for any discussion to unfold... 
 thank you to the publisher for sending me an arc. the quotes above were taken from an arc and are subject to change upon publication. wow, what a ride! this was a fantastic conclusion to the duology! there was laughter and pain and explosions and it made for a very satisfying finale to august & kate's story. 
 ...but we're not done with the world yet, are we?? it's just so cool and i still have so many questions. like i definitely need more books set in this world please thank you. super cute and fun! loved the first half, but the second half felt a little all over the place. overall, it was lighthearted and sweet and exactly what i thought it would be! 4.5* 
 i love leigh bardugo so much and she did such an amazing job with this story. i loved how it showed the power of strong female friendships and just girl power in general. my only complaint is that i felt there wasn't quite enough action for a superhero novel. 
 booktalk to come!! i will link it when it's up. 
 *thank you to chapters indigo for providing me with an arc!* i was forced into watching mockingjay: part ii this weekend. to clarify, i watched the second part of the last hunger games movie without having read any of the books, without having watched any of the movies. 
 needless to say, i was confused as fuck. 
 so many questions and thoughts ran through my mind as i watched the movie. why is peeta so thin? did that huge-ass bruise really disappear from her neck the next day? is katniss supposed to look like she's about to burst into tears at any given moment, or is that just jennifer lawrence? woody harrelson is in this movie? hey, it's margaery from game of thrones! who's president snow? what's a mockingjay? lesser hemsworth is pretty hot. 
 well, you get the point. i know how the book ended and i still have no idea who anyone is, and neither do i know their names, with the exception of peeta, gale, president snow, that coin woman, and katniss. of course, knowing how the book ended means i probably should read the first book, so here i am, the last person on earth to read the hunger games. 
 and it was good. it was really good. my sister was right (she usually is). 
 what else can i say that hasn't already been said? i loved it. the world building was interesting (although it helps that i've seen what it looks like on the big screen), and katniss is awesome. one of the things my sister didn't like about the first movie is that the on-screen katniss was different from her portrayal in the first book. i haven't watched that movie, but i kind of see how the screen portrayal of katniss might have bothered her. book-katniss is strong, kick-ass without being a mary sue. she has a fierce love for her sister, and she is manipulative and cunning. she uses the prospect of romance to protect herself, she has no qualms about using people, and i love that about her. 
 time to watch movie #1! final books are hard. readers dive in with so many expectations, hopes and fears, and let's not forget the ships. i suspect it must be at least a little daunting for an author to want to give their readers everything and stay true to their story. friends, for me, marie rutkoski has done just that. this story has taken me on a remarkable journey, capturing my heart and and melting my emotions in one fell swoop. 
 the winner's kiss is a perfect conclusion to an expertly crafted series. and as always there are many familiar reasons to love the final installment as much as its predecessors while containing quite a few twists that kept me anticipating the turn of each page. our protagonists, kestrel and arin, experience a lot of growth as previous choices finally reach shocking, climatic consequences, many of which i was unsure how they'd move past. i definitely didn't expect the changes kestrel underwent; she is both the same and vastly different, exploring physical and mental strength of female characters. 
 you don't need to be gifted with a blade. you are your own best weapon. 
 the unpredictability of this novel is its greatest weapon as rutkoski clearly shows she's not afraid to make you beg for your favorites' survival. she's heartlessly brilliant like that. 
 what i didn't expect was how much i enjoyed roshar's character. i give his sarcastic, witty remarks an a++ and loved how he reminded me of a rougher version of sturmhond from the grisha series. it was smart for him to have as much page time as he did since the winner's kiss contains romantic tension to the max with a few scenes causing me utter desperation--moments where i was throwing buckets of water out of my ship, lest it sink, screaming ""noooooooooo!"" fiercely at my ceiling. 
 i still admire the writing and how it manages to convey so much more than is actually written. it's made me re-think my stance on 3rd person narration, usually my least favorite. but the fact that i, too, now feel as though i can translate kestrel and arin's epic starring contests, roshar and arin's bromatic body language among a host of other tells, just goes to show you the quality of writing. no words are wasted, and always feel so carefully deliberate while still maintaining its raw honesty. 
 perhaps what the winner's kiss succeeds at the most is its ability to straddle that fine line between a character driven and plot driven novel. neither side took over the other, out-shining or lacking in development. the relationships were given the proper amount of time and dignity. not only is there a focus on kestrel and arin's, but also of another that's made very clear it's just as important, and maybe even more so. and, yes, in case you were wondering, this book does indeed pass the bechdel test, something which i'm always pleased to see in a ya novel. 
 the plot was excellent. surprisingly detailed battle scenes, strategies and political maneuvers are at the front without making my eyes glaze over with confusion. and i loved that arin's cultural religious beliefs along side kestrel's disbelief was handled with a great amount of respect and love. it really highlighted an ongoing theme of tolerance and respect of others' differences, and that is so incredibly relevant. and, of course, i really enjoyed how the novel began and ended with a winner's curse, bringing the entire series full circle. nice touch. 
 i am fiercely in love with all things kestrel and arin. their relationship struggle in the novel was so real. finally a ya book where it's not the fantasy world keeping them apart, but actual real relationship bumps that plagues us all: break down of communication, acknowledgements of individual changes and growth, trust issues, accepting faults along with strengths, understanding personal struggles, guilt of hurting the one you love the most, forgiveness, and above all, mutual respect. 
 favorite quote: 
 ""he changed us both."" she seemed to struggle for words. ""i think of you, all that you lost, who you were, what you were forced to be, and might have been, and i--i have become this, this person, unable to--"" 
 she shut her mouth. 
 ""kestrel,"" he said softly, ""i love this person."" 
 it's sad for me to come to the conclusion of a favorite series, one that i never expected to adore so much. but i loved every minute of this ride and can't wait to revisit. 
 highly recommending. 
 excellent series is excellent. 
 an arc was provided by the publisher. no monies or favors were exchanged. 
 more reviews and other fantastical things at cuddlebuggery. even though i just finished this book, i already know it's one that will stick with me for years to come. i can't fully express how cathartic this book was. i finally saw parts of myself represented in a novel - the parts that i was ashamed of and pretended didn't exist. this is by far my favorite john green novel. i can't say much more about this because i'm still sobbing over it. just read it, please. highkey hoping joseph falls off a cliff and we never see him again. :)"," this book cost me around 600 dollars 
 when i'm traveling to and from conventions i use the airplane time to catch up on my reading a lot of times this means i'm taking the opportunity to read books that have been popular for a while but that i haven't gotten around to i feel like i should be aware of the landscape 
 anyway on my way home from seattle i had a layover in minneapolis i grabbed this book so i'd have something to read while i was eating dinner in the airport 
 so i ate dinner and i read the book and i lost track of time and i missed my plane 
 i ended up having to rent a car and drive the three and a half hours back to stevens point

 aedion lysandra manon arobynn 
 i had about twelve heart attacks while reading this book it was awesome how to write popular ya supernatural literature and defile your spirit 
 based on the popular ya novel evermore and aided by countless more like it i have compiled an easy to read and follow list of rules for writing a popular series and being able to sell out your soul at the same time does that sound too convenient well it's unbelievably easy to do if you follow my quick and easy program 
 1 create an 'outcast' heroine 
 it's important that your primarily female teenage audience can relate to your main character so whilst you can't have your main character associate herself with being cool it still has to be obvious to your audience that she totally is now meyer's approach of the goose-turned swan-but was really still a goose bella associated herself as 'different' and a 'loner' only to arrive at her new school and be immediately popular and accepted by almost everyone noel's method is different yet in a similar spirit her protagonist ever was incredibly popular at her old school and has decided to be an outcast because she feels that she can't be accepted due to her psychic gift she also has the ability to perceive someone's personality through the colours that define them so instead of aligning herself with the shallow mean and popular crowd she aligns herself with the shallow and mean loners 
 it's very important for your protagonists to be 'different' because today's youth despise the sheep mentality and so they all strive to be unique since they're all different in almost the exact same way it is relatively easy to emulate this with as little effort put into characterization as possible in your female protagonist 
 as long as she shows no regard for her clothing appearance or any kind of interest in giving a shit about anyone but herself she will easily pass with young audiences it will be her ewniqueness that eventually draws the perfect hero to her as opposed to any of the usual elements such as: looks hygiene personality or determinable interest in the world outside their own arse 
 please also remember that she probably should be a reader preferably of wuthering heights or romeo and juliet and that she should consider everyone around her to have inferior intelligence despite the fact that her reading repertoire extends to only a couple of books 
 a noticeably absent family is necessary and a completely dead family makes for a better story because then she actually has a perceived reason to be a moody antisocial self-absorbed little bitch do this even though in all likelihood she would be all of the above with a perfectly normal family 
 2 create a perfect hero 
 it is very important that your hero be perfect in almost every regard unlike the female protagonist who can disregard her appearance he must not only be more attractive than a gq model without any of the effort put into his appearance but he must also be thoughtful intelligent and mysterious 
 in no way is he to reflect almost every teenage boy to have ever existed and he must have no desire to find a partner for himself who is in anyway comparable in looks kindness intelligence or perfection 
 if he is a vampire or some such immortal then he must be ridiculously wealthy if he is a werewolf then he is allowed to be poor but must make up for it with incredible bedroom skills 
 he needn't have a personality that extends beyond mysterious sexy and in love with the female protagonist naturally in this respect meyers mead marr and stiefvater are something like overachievers - but if noel saintcrow clare kate and fitzpatrick are any indication then we need know little more about the hero other than the fact that he's gorgeous has a secret and is in love history friends likes dislikes family passions interests hobbies and personality flaws are all negligible information that is taking up precious space in your novel especially when you could be injecting more drooling from the female protagonist in place of any kind of characterization for your hero 
 your book will sell better if the hero stalks follows obsesses over and actively pursues the heroine beyond any realm of believability you could triple your audience just by having him watch her sleep 
 3 create useless friends 
 it's important to reiterate to the young adult generation that nobody other than the hero is important since domestic abuse begins with one partner manoeuvring the other to have limited contact with anyone else we must strive to normalize this in literature thus the female protagonist shouldn't have anyone close enough to her that she can't break contact or eventually forget about them it's very important that her full focus socialization and all of her needs are eventually devoted or met by the male protagonist 
 to aid this her friends must be selfish vain crazy slutty uncaring or in other ways undeserving of the heroine's attentions and affections it's very important that she never call them on their poor damaging and graceless friendship but must lovingly worry about them for the minimal amount of time acceptable to the reader before once again completely focusing on the mysterious hero 
 4 mix in a twisted convoluted plot designed entirely to provide dramatic and sexy subplot 
 it's important that the plot no matter how unlikely must revolve around the hero saving the heroine the villains do not necessarily need to have realistic or conceivable motivations for their actions as long as the hero gets to save the day at least three or four times then your book will be profitable 
 please remember that the actual plot of your story needn't truly begin until at least 350 pages into your story the longer you can stall any interesting event occuring the less thinking you will actually need to do 
 plus - for free - extras to help 'improve' your novel the bottom line of your sales and the expedient destruction of your soul 
 -how to create a senseless mythology 
 mythology is more of a concept rather than something that needs to be respected or honoured vampires don't need to refrain from daylight and angels no longer need to ""fall"" for good they can now be redeemed like us the good news is that creating your own mythology disregarding anything written before allows you to twist and bastardize the plot beyond any recognizably interesting concept 
 -explanations as to why research could actually damage your profit 
 research takes time energy and intelligence why do it you've got ten fingers (presumably) and an attention span that extends past anything that could be compared to a gnat (even if it is only barely) simply make it up as you go for example: ever is psychic research may tell us that this has something to do with receiving visions of the future or possibly commnicating with ghosts yet research is boring instead she is imbued with the following powers that we guess can kind of be put under a psychic umbrella if we force enough information and logic out of our brains first: mind reading visions of near-present and future personal life knowledge of any person she physically touches seeing ghosts seeing auras literary osmosis from touching any written object drawing the answers from any written question placed before her and any other supernatural abilities that seem convenient at the time 
 -detailed observations on why the deus ex machina rocks 
 tying together a plot even if you work to keep it as non-complicated or infantile as possible is hard it's much easier to ignore tying together a number of plot points in any believable fashion and instead rely on some deus ex machina to come in and take care of thoughtful planning for you 
 -how to expand one nonsensical idea into a series and why this is more profitable than originality 
 last but not least ensure that your story is somewhat open ended so that you can create a series out of it research shows that people even if they are intelligent enough to see that you're writing is becoming progressively shittier and nonsensical will often still purchase books in the series in order to find out what happens so rather than creating a new story with new characters simply beat the same old horse (it needn't really be a horse - simply a pile of shit that's been forced into a horse-like shape) for at least three or more books in order to squeeze every last cent out of the franchise that you can 
 this review can also be found on my blog cuddlebuggery book blog i need more ""i cheated on her every day in my mind i thought of you in ways i shouldn't have again and again she was nothing compared to you i've never felt this way about anybody before--"" 
 what's the saying once a cheater always a cheater oh the fucking hypocrisy 
 there were many things i wanted to do to anna oliphant throughout this book some of them involve a bottle of choloroform a shovel and an unmarked grave mostly i just want to bring anna in front of the us congress as an example of how the us educational system has grievously failed our students to be frank anna oliphant is a motherfucking idiot 
 yeah i guess you could say this is a sweet romance but it's not the good sort of sweet it's the ""oh my god why did i eat that entire package of oreos i don't even like oreos"" sort of sweet it's sickening and best in small doses and i still feel like i need an internal cleanse after spreading the reading of this book over several days the good thing about it is that this book isn't the sugar-free type of sweet so there were no anal explosions it wasn't the worst contemporary i've ever read but this book was tremendously annoying and i simply do not understand the hype i know many of people enjoyed it and i can see why anna is the sort of character that grows on you much like mildew or herpes once you get used to having it it doesn't really bother you much anymore 
 i'm not opposed to romance i love romance but i read this book hoping to be swept away by a romance instead i was sucked into a whirlwind of idiocy 
 oh the stupidity: 
 the only french word i know is oui which means ""yes"" and only recently did i learn it's spelled o-u-i and not w-e-e 
 people like anna oliphant is the reason why everyone hates americans anna is 17 and she is a moron she is the epitome of the stupid ignorant egocentric american for fuck's sakes she thinks there are motherfucking mimes on every fucking corner in france she thinks that people go watch mimes as an everyday pastime 
 i'm going to be sick i'm going to vomit that weird eggplant tapenade i had for dinner and everyone wil hear and no one will invite me to watch the mimes escape from their invisible boxes or whatever it is people do here in their spare time 
 i'm sorry but i'm inclined to judge anyone who doesn't know that 
 oui 
 is spelled o-u-i and not w-e-e it's one of those foreign words that isn't even fucking foreign because it's so fucking common oui is yes in french si is yes in spanish it's one of those words that's so fucking commonly used that you have to be a complete birdbrain not to know 
 anna is terrified of anything foreign although to me france really isn't that foreign or exotic but i didn't grow up in atlanta is atlanta really that ass-fucking backward is atlanta really completely isolated from the rest of the world despite being one of the biggest cities in the us (anna's words) do they not have paninis in atlanta 
 ""where have you been all my life"" i ask the beautiful panini ""how is it possible i've never had a sandwich like this before"" 
 not only is she ignorant she has no survival skills anna is in paris attending a school for americans fucking everyone speaks english the french teachers speak english anna is terrified of getting food in the cafeteria and avoids the cafeteria for weeks because she doesn't know how to order food 
 let me tell you a brilliant way of ordering food in any language you smile you make eye contact at the desired food you point you nod it's motherfucking universal 
 i hate to say it but if you're a pretty girl you can get anyone's help (most likely a guy but often another girl too) just by looking cute and helpless and tilting your head at an angle (guilty as charged) it ain't feminist but it works when one is desperate and the fact that anna doesn't have the fucking common sense to do this instead of hiding in her room for weeks like a motherfucking pussy doesn't bring her up in my estimation i'm not judging anna for being shy anna is not shy i was a shy shy teenager anna is incompetent there is a difference between incompetency and shyness 
 after weeks and weeks of going to classes of learning frenchanna doesn't know how to fucking spell ""please"" in french 
 mer is next in line and i transcribe her speech phonetically 
 oon ploss see voo play 
 that's suppsed to be une place s'il vous plait 
 her impression of paris is one with like blah blah marie antoinette and that really short dude like i think his name is napoleon you know like the one on the horse in that painting by that dude and oh my god the moulin rouge and that cute little movie with the little girl in the yellow thingy madeline 
 and this is a chick who wants to be a film critic when she grows up 
 my dream is to study film theory in california i want to be our nation's greatest female film critic 
 although judging from the way she thinks i think she's more suited to a career writing for the tabloids the type with the sort of ""president obama caught in interplanetary orgy along with putin and merkel"" headline rather than as a film critic 
 i wonder if matt is a better kisser now that he has someone more experienced to practice on he was probably a bad kisser because of me 
 oh no 
 i'm a bad kisser i am i must be 
 someday i'll be awarded a statue shaped like a pair of lips and it'll be engraved with the words world's worst kisserand matt will give a speech about how he only dated me because he was desperate but i didn't put out so i was a waste of time because cherrie milliken liked him all along and she totally puts out 
 oh god does toph think i'm a bad kisser 
 anna anna anna: so beautiful without knowing it so perfect so adorably fucking clumsy she even looks gorgeous when she falls flat on her fucking face 
 ""you're beautiful"" 
 i trip and fall down on the sidewalk 
 i look away as he takes my hand and helps me up ""i'm fine fine"" i say brushing the grit from my palms oh my god i am a freak 
 ""you've seen the way men look at you right"" he continues 
 ""if they're looking it's because i keep making a fool of myself"" 
 i've seen this before and it ain't cute spare me the whole adorkable thing i don't like zooey deschanel and i don't like anna it just looks like she's trying too fucking hard and the cute but oh-so-clumsy trope is just so fucking overplayed right now i wash my hands of it 
 it's not blatant but the relationships between the girls in this book are meant to portray anna as the good one the best one the most adorakablest girly girl in the whole wide fucking world rashmi is ""rash"" cute i don't think so mer is just a little chubby volleyball player chubby but it's ok ^_^; amanda the slut amanda the bitch and anna anna is just so good because you know she feels really bad that etienne likes her so she does everything she can to make mer not jealous it's not mer's fault that she's not good enough for etienne and boy saint anna keeps reminding us that she's a good person 
 and poor ellie poor ellie etienne's girlfriend but surely it's ok for etienne to cheat on ellie with anna if she looks like a slut right 
 slutty nurse i don't believe it tiny white button-up dress red crosses across the nipples cleavage city 
 cheating is ok if your girlfriend is a bitch: that's the message that this book sends oh that ellie that stupid stuck up ellie ellie who thinks she is better than everyone else surely it's fine if etienne seeks comfort elsewhere if his girlfriend is a cold fish a stuck up snot right no i don't fucking think so how about you break up with her first just because a girl is a jerk doesn't mean she deserves to be cheated on i do not appreciate the way this book sends the message that it's morally acceptable to cheat on a girlfriend who neglects you but it's morally acceptable to cheat on her if you feeeeeeeeeeeeel bad about it right fuck this shit 
 the cheating: and yes it is cheating what do you call this 
 ""i said you were beautiful i slept in your bed"" 
 ""you never made a move you had a girlfriend"" 
 ""no matter what a terrible boyfriend i was i wouldn't actually cheat on her but i thought you'd know with me being there i thought you'd know"" 
 ok etienne has a girlfriend ellie etienne holds hands with anna he is still with ellie 
 it's nice holding hands comfortable 
 i wish friends held hands more often like the children i see on the streets sometimes i'm not sure why we have to grow up and get embarrassed about it 
 you know why because you wouldn't like it if etienne held hands with another girl if he was dating you fucking hypocrite 
 friends don't sleep in each others' beds 
 i mean i didn't sleep sleep with him obviously but i slept with him 
 i slept with a boy i burrow back down into my sheets and grin 
 and that boy has a girlfriend and then you do it again while he still has a girlfriend while you have an almost-boyfriend 
 you make eye contact and blush at each other in a theatre while he has a girlfriend 
 you kiss each other while he has a girlfriend while you have an almost-boyfriend 
 you flirt with each other while he has a girlfriend while you have an almost-boyfriend 
 i don't see this relationship lasting very long ughhhhh i neeeeddd morrrreeeeee ""graceling meets selection"" whatever marketing team came up with that tag for this series clearly never read the book red queen is game of thrones with katniss as the mockingjay with x-men in a tantalizing ya twist of magical perfection 
 three quotes that summarize this series spoiler-free: 
 ""anyone can betray anyone"" meet the lannisters silver court and their current royal family 
 ""make no mistake my girl you are playing the game as someone's pawn"" 
 ""i am a fool"" 
 sooooooooo my initial reaction: 
 i have to wait another year let me repeat: i have to wait another year 
 yeaaaaa i'm totally cool with that not 
 okay now before i go all crazy fan girl let me start by saying that no one and i repeat no one had higher expectations for this than me (well maaaaybe victoria:d) i am the world's biggest medieval/dystopian ya fantasy nut & i have been looking for a book like this my whole life my whole life people so it isn't a high stretch of imagination to say with all the hype i was expecting to be let down because let's face it: most of the hype let's you down (thank you million dollar marketing campaigns for all the *cough cough* next-big-things) 
 (and in case you are wondering i never wanted to read hunger games or harry potter so while those blew my mind in a totally awesome way they were never really on my tbr to begin with red queen on the other hand has been a book i thought i would love from the beginning) 
 and then the hype got bigger: 
 reviewers i follow and love start saying magical words like ""shatter me"" ""darkling"" and ""x-men-like powers"" 
 so this was me one minute before midnight when red queen released: 
 and guess what it beat my over-hyped up imagination this book is now one of my favorites of all time red queen is everything a ya medieval fantasy should be i loved every minute of it 
 alright now to my actual thoughts on this book i marked the whole thing as a spoiler because i am lazy but yea trust me when i say you don't want this ruined (so read on at your own peril): 
 1 ""little lightning girl"" okay yea the way they use her reminded me a lot of mockingjay not going to lie 
 2 cal - shame on you you hot beautiful prince you you were totally scamming and making move's on your brother's girl i know you are supposed to come off as this nice guy but before maven turned out to be evil i seriously did not like you i mean i was totally rooting for you and mare (*gasps that dance scene*) but i was mad at you for being the popular/likable guy when you were totally secretly making eyes at your brother's wife that you know he's falling for that said i still loved your romance scenes and i do like you i will admit to my sickness 
 3 maven maven maven maven hello darkling meets joffrey kind of like malfoy with a heart y'all know that scene in harry potter i'm talking about: 
 so needless to say i am secretly in love with him because i am shameless and always root for the complicated guy and/or villain love interest 
 #teamwarnerdarklingmorpheusjacedamonsalvatoredaemonblack -and now maven 
 4 this book totally has a love triangle (maybe more you can never tell with the childhood friend what's-his-name) but strangely enough i enjoyed it it played out to my guilty pleasure side if maven wasn't in this book i would totally be in love with cal and vice versa i loved them both the only other time i have loved both guys in a love triangle was cassandra clare's infernal devices series (and even then i still obviously preferred will but i was definitely okay with both) 
 5 there were definite cliches/overused tropes: 
 ""you're going to be his brother's wife and he's going to war"" 
 ""i am the little lightning girl and i am going to make the world change"" 
  but i was down with them because tropes & cliches are there for a reason we all secretly love them we just don't love them when the writing sucks 
 only trope i hated: the instalove with cal & mare i was cool with it until (i apologize for the rant) this happened: 
 maven shakes his head ""he [cal] will always choose you"" 
 >> really yea he liked her but now everyone was suddenly ""cal will choose you over his country"" umm no that part annoyed me to no end because while i was down with instalike i was not down with instalove (and i did not interpret cal as that much of an idiot) thank the gods that turned out not to be true it's cool that cal hesitated but if he had actually chosen mare i would have lost respect for him instead i gained so much more for him standing up to her and turning her in way to go cal 
 6 the brother shade wtf why didn't the guard tell her about him if he was still alive that twist annoyed me they didn't suspect maven so they had no reason to keep it a secret maybe i missed something but that was the only plot hole of the book and honestly it was so small i didn't care 
 7 queen elara (enough said): ""like any wife she hates her husband for challenging her and like any queen she hates the power the king holds over her"" 
 now onto my favorite scene let's be honest: it was everyone's we all knew a big twist was coming but it was still so epic and helloooo darkling aka maven i knew you were more than just your brother's shadow 
 ""he rolls his shoulders cracking his bones to chase away an ache his motions are sluggish and strange and when he settles back on his feet hands on hips i feel like i'm seeing him for the first time his eyes are so cold"" 
 the queen was way too much of a biatch to just stand on the sidelines with the most awesome power (whisper) of all 
 ""because she already knew because he is her son because this was her plan all along"" 
 when malfoy/joffrey listened to cersei lannister maven listened to his mother i had this image in my head: 
 followed by a wish that mare had her powers back to do this: 
 i loved every minute of this book guys read it now i literally bookmarked every single page and not just the maven parts guys all of it 
 and finally my favorite line of the whole book: 
 ""this was the shadow controlling the flame"" 
 yea i know i'm #teammaven i know you are all #teamcal hence i leave you with this: 
 omg i cannot wait for the next book i hate this book absolutely hate it not just from the bottom of my heart (which would literally mean my ventricles and so no) but with my whole heart i hate it hate it hate it 
 i hate the fact that it made me laugh so hard 
 i hate the fact that it made me smile so much 
 i hate the fact that it made me chuckle so profusely 
 i hate the fact that it gifted me with so much laughter smiles and chuckles when i was expecting to come face to face with tragedy at any momentit changed my expectations made me believe in something which did not happenor maybe did happen 
 i hate the fact that while hazel grace 
 fell in love the way you fall asleep: slowly and then all at once 
  i just 
 fell 
 no warning no time to process the myriad emotions coursing through me nope nothing just a huge endless void-filled fall and then a sudden crash that took my breath away like literally 
 i hate the fact that i fell in love with this bound-to-end-in-oblivion bound-to-end-in-disaster boy who stared with blue blue eyes and put the killing thing right between his teeth but never gave it the power to do its killing (putting a cigarette right between your teeth and never lighting it yes that's augustus waters for you people a guy huge on metaphors and symbolismthat hopeless boy) 
 i hate the fact that when i least expected it the story the words just grabbed me and pulled me in so deep that even the thought of ever resurfacing never entered my mind 
 i hate that the fact that right in the middle of my dance in the rain of laughter dry wit and humour without any warning without any lightning as it's precedent this thunder would stun me startle me wipe the smile right off my face and sober me up wake me up from the intoxication of the very real yet false jocularity spun by them a humour which was nothing but human tragedy waiting-to-happen-and-had-already-happened in disguise and then push me back into that rain to dance again 
 i hate the fact that i'm not making my much sense right nowthat right now 
 my thoughts are stars i can't fathom into constellations 
 and yes all the hate above is a metaphor a symbolic word for love weird right but right now i can't bring myself to say that i love this booki don't i don't i don't (yes i do i do i do) 
 so *deep breath* it's a story of a girl named hazel grace lancaster a girl diagnosed with thyroid cancer at the age of 13 who's still alive at 16 thanks to a miracle drug which didn't work it's miracle in about 70% of the people but it did work in her 
 so even though her lungs suck at being lungs she's still alive and well not kicking but breathing with difficulty (because remember her lungs suck at being lungs) but breathing nonetheless 
 she's been nothing but a terminal case ever since her diagnosis the doctors are simply finding ways of keeping her alive rather than removing the cancer ridden lungs and replacing it with a new one because let's face it her chances of surviving such an operation are like next to nothing and why waste a good pair of lungs on a given bound-to-fail body 
 so hazel has never been anything but terminal her final chapter inscribed upon diagnosis 
 enter augustus waters he's 17 gorgeous in remission and very frankly and much to her surprise interested in her 
 it's a match made in cancer kid support group in the literal heart of jesus (you'll know what that means when you read the bookyou'll laugh trust me you will) 
 he is a tenured professor in the department of slightly crooked smiles with a dual appointment in the department of having a voice that made my skin feel more like skin 
 he's the unexpected hot gorgeous twist in her storya story which is about to be completely rewritten 
 their story begins with a staring contesthe stares at her 
 so she stares backbecause let's face it 
 (spoiler alert: she wins) 
 and it progresses into something brilliant something as bright as the stars into something with a capital s 
 i hate this book (this needs indefinite repetitions i hate it) 
 i hate the fact that i fell in love with their always 
 ""okay"" 
 i hate the fact that hazel grace took the words right out of my mouth when she said what she said about being a vegetarian 
 ""i want to minimise the number of deaths i am responsible for"" 
 and about not knowing what's cool 
 ""i take a lot of pride in not knowing what's cool"" 
 i hate the fact that i fell in love with this blue-eyed boy who drove horrifically and his cheesy and yet very endearing attempts to be prince charming(but more so with himthe surprised excited and innocent side of him) 
 ""may i see you again"" he asked there was an endearing nervousness in his voice 
 i smiled ""sure"" 
 ""tomorrow"" he asked 
 ""patience grasshopper"" i counseled ""you don't want to seem overeager"" 
 ""right that's why i said tomorrow"" he said ""i want to see you again tonight but i'm willing to wait all night and much of tomorrow"" 
 i hate the fact that hazel grace felt like a grenade and all she wanted to do was minimise the casualities when (not if but when) she blew up 
 i hate the fact that i felt sorry for a lonely swing seta desperately lonely swing set which needed a loving homeor maybe it was simply a lonely vaguely pedophilic swing set which sought the butts of childrenand the fact that i absolutely love this sentence 
 the lonely swing set 
 or maybe just vaguely pedophilic 
 and even though i fell in love the way you fall from a cliff or a building (don't really know how that feelssince i've never done that)i hate the way she fell in love 
 i hate this kissbecause for who so firm that cannot be seduced 
 and then we were kissing my hand let go of the oxygen cart and i reached up for his neck and he pulled me up by my waist onto my tiptoes as his parted lips met mine i started to feel breathless in a new and fascinating way the space around us evaporated and for a weird moment i really liked my body; this cancer-ruined thing i'd spent years dragging around suddenly seemed worth the struggle worth the chest tubes and the picc lines and the ceaseless bodily betrayal of the tumors 
 i hate the love letter she wrote him(spoiler alert: it's a venn diagram love letter) 
 i hate the fact that she did not agree with maslow's hierarchy of needs (in which abraham maslow an american psychologist claimed that certain needs must be met before you can even have other kinds of needs) something like this 
 unless and until your needs of the previous level have been fulfilled you don't even think about the needs of the next level of course like all psychological theories this one too cannot be generalized or accepted universally because if there is one law in psychology then it is that there is no law in psychology there is no given universal laws for human behaviour or thoughts or anything every theory has it's use and flaws applicable to some while not applicable to others and this one is not applicable in this situation nope not at all 
 i hate the words the word play in this book 
 a quantum entanglement of tubes and bodiestriumphantly digitized contemporaneity 
 i hate the fact that it made me laugh so much smile a lot fall in love so hard only to exact revenge later on for giving in to the false security of humour and love by making me cryoh god cry so muchso much 
 because that's the thing about pain it demands to be felt 
 i get ittotally get it 
 i hate the fact that i ever read this sentence 
 ""i lit up like a christmas tree hazel grace"" 
  
 i hate it i really hate it (forget metaphorical resonances forget symbolism i actually hate it) 
 i hate the fact that it made me cry so much that the lovers of-god-knows-which-century entwined on my pillowcase were drenched in the torrent of my tears and were probably ruing the fact that there was no umbrella during their time 
 i hate the fact that i stayed up whole night reading this book half of the night crying and even after finishing it i couldn't go to sleep so the rest of the dawn just pacing in my room with all these haphazard desultory stars jumping around in my mind finding absolutely no avenue to become constellationsand my eyes puffy (note to self: do not stay up all night or add crying to it if you do to avoid puffy eyes) 
 why do i do this to myself 
 and i absolutely hate this 
 i hate that this story is stunningly overwhelming insightful irreverent raw and devastatingand to quote markus zusak it's the kind of story reading which ""you laugh you cry and then you come back for more"" 
 some infinities are bigger than other infinities 
 i'm grateful for having known this little infinitygrateful for this epic love story of two star crossed lovers 
 [image error] 
 i like my choices i hope you like yours 
 and by hate you know i meant love right 
 i love this book 
 right now my thoughts are too jumbled up this was amazing it was exactly what i wanted from a series finale--epic intense emotional and satisfying just like with the previous books i loved the world the characters the story and the writing this is one of my favorite series of all time and i'm so so happy with this beautiful conclusion 
 if you like sci-fi fairy tale retellings or you just want to read an epic & satisfying series--you need the lunar chronicles in your life just i cant yes this book bless this book that ending damn i can't even type in complete sentences after reading glass sword (even though i just did) if you've experienced that first love - that heart-wringing soul-squeezing crush-the-air-out-of-your-lungs-whenever-you're-apart first love - this book will bitch slap your feels all to hell 
 i love it i love its warmth and its vibrancy its heartache and its pain its humor its meanness the ugliness the beauty the crying the laughter the sarcasm i love eleanor and i love park and i love that there's still a tiny chance for themand for everyone whose first love was torn away even if you never see that person again they change you in ways that no one else will ever understand they will always always hold that little piece of your heart that no one else will ever be able to touch 
 i love you rainbow rowell for giving me this thank you let's play a little game of: 
 who am i 
 -my book starts with me moving to a new location and starting at a new school 
 -i live with just my dad but don't worry about him he's not important in fact you'll barely notice he exists at all 
 -i quickly make friends at my new school i'm not sure why everyone likes me i'm not remotely interesting 
 -i've never had a boyfriend before meeting my love interest and for some reason people at my school find that hard to believe 
 -as soon as my love interest catches my eye i can't get him out of my mind he's the mysterious type but he only has eyes for me he quickly becomes my boyfriend and we fall deeply in love *swoon* 
 -my boyfriend happens to have a sibling who simply adores me how could she not i'm so awesome she has a super special sight too ps her name starts with an ""a"" 
 -my b-b-boyfriend---sorry that was me swooning again; he's so super howt *giggle*---also has another sibling that doesn't seem to like me at first they are always glaring at me it unnerves me but i can get through anything with my boy toy by my side oh and ps their name starts with an ""r"" 
 -my boyfriend just happens to save my life with his mysterious powers at first when i confront him about it he plays it off it really upsets me it just wasn't fair 
 -he later tells me that he can't stay away from me any longer and soon after he takes me to his home to really introduce me to his family 
 -i find out he's been stalking me for a while but it doesn't bother me i find it incredibly romantic 
 -*psst* if my boyfriend and i were to have a baby it would be some strange half-breed child 
 -randomly out of nowhere i'm kidnapped by a tracker i'm not sure where he came from because this book is all about me and my one true love 
 -when i'm not hanging out with my boyfriend or getting abducted i can be found brushing my teeth eating cereal doing homework or cooking for my dad oh and i hate being the center of attention i'm so selfless 
 -by the end of my book i end up in the hospital 
 sowho am i 
 if you guessed bella swan you are correct but if you guessed megan rosenberg you are also correct don't bother looking up to the top of the screen this is indeed a carrier of the mark review or as i like to call it twilight 20 or better yet carrier of the twilight or twi-remix or twilight goes to ireland or or orokay you get the picture and no i'm not kidding all the above actually happens in this book 
 i feel like i need to start saying how sorry i am to leigh fallon truly i am you see i'm in the middle of re-reading the twilight series and as a result i am hyperaware of the twi-likeness this book has i was really eager to get my hands on carrier of the mark but you have no idea how disappointed i am in this book so it is with a heavy heart that i review twilight carrier of the mark again 
 seventeen-year-old bella swan megan rosenberg moves to forks ireland after her dad charlie caleb accepts and new position at a yacht club on her first day at school she notices a mysterious boy named edward cullen adam deris staring at her she literally cannot stop thinking about him for the rest of the book i'm not going to retell the book here but if you've read twilight just sprinkle on a little air bender add a pinch of captain planet and toss a creepy baby on top and you pretty much have the recipe for carrier of the mark instead i'm going to be pulling a few select quotes with commentary pour moi 
 adam randomly confesses his feelings to megan after have several staring contests: 
 they told me from the very beginning that it wasn't safe to 'consort'"" he said slightly wincing at the word ""with you but i'm not strong enough to stay away"" 
 now where have i heard that before 
 twilight: 
 he heard the change in my tone his eyes tightened ""i don't seem to be strong enough to stay away from you"" 
 a little pda action: 
 i put my hand on adam's face and felt along his cheek and down along his jaw reveling in the softness of his skin in comparison to the light stubble he closed his eyes 
 ""you have no idea how good that feels"" he murmured 
 that sounds so familiar 
 twilight: 
 ""do you mind"" i asked for he had closed his eyes again 
 ""no"" he said without opening his eyes ""you can't imagine how that feels"" he sighed 
 i lightly trailed my hand over the perfect muscles of his arm followed the faint pattern of bluish veins inside the crease at his elbow 
 rosalie rian doesn't like megan at first: 
 ""rian has a tough time accepting who we are and our purposei think he's just finding it hard to accept that you would opt in when you have the chance to walk away"" 
 now who had the same issue 
 twilight: 
 he sighed deeply ""rosalie struggles the most with with what we are it's hard for her to have someone on the outside know the truth and she's a little jealousyou're human"" he shrugged ""she wishes that she were too"" 
 there is a tracker following megan: 
 it's been years since we have even seen a tracker in ireland"" 
 ""is that what the guy in the theater was a tracker"" 
 ""i think so we can't be sure at the moment but he fits the usual profile there's something different this time though; he's getting around our defenses we just don't know how he's doing it"" 
 funny that's just who was following bella too 
 twilight: 
 ""he's a tracker alice did you see that he's a tracker"" 
 love interest serching for a way to protect heroine from the tracker: 
 ""don't apologize i hate to see you hurting like that please believe me when i tell you that i will make you safe"" 
 didn't edward promise the same thing in a very similar situation 
 twilight: 
 ""soon as soon as i possibly can i will make you safe first"" his voice was hard 
 a bad guy was snooping around megan's room and house adam has his family guarding her but somehow they manage to slip through: 
 ""someone was in her room for christ's sake in her room"" 
 ""but i don't think he was still there when megan got home if he had been he would have acted right then and there i'd say her mark was sensing that he'd been there earlier"" 
 rian shook his head ""how is he getting around our senses we've always known when the knox are close this is bad"" 
 can't seem to put my finger on itoh wait i can 
 twilight (eclipse): 
 ""he was in her room alice he could have still been there -- waiting for her"" 
 ""i would have seen that"" 
 edward threw his hands up in exasperation ""really you're sure"" alice's voice was cold when she answered ""you've already got me watching the volturis' decisions watching for victoria's return watching bella's every step you want to add another do i just have to watch charlie or bella's room or the house or the whole street too edward if i try to do too much things are going to start slipping through the cracks"" 
 shitdamn 
 oh but the similarities don't end there right after adam reveals his feelings to megan the very next day he takes her to meet his family and if you remember that is exactly what edward did after he revealed all his feelings to bella in the meadow scene (confessions chapter 13) aine alice adam's sister also has a ""sight"" fionn carlisle is adam's adoptive father adam admitted to stalking megan just like edward did to bella megan confides in her best friend caitlin in math class what do you know that's the same place bella confided with jessica at both adam and edward's eyes change color (interestingly both share the same original color: green) 
 i just couldn't get past all the twilight references i'm honestly baffled at how this book got published with all the shocking similarities because carrier of the mark reads just like a twilight fan-fic and not a good one i'd give this book a freakin' ""a+"" for following the ""twilight book disaster"" recipe to the t but an all around ""f"" (fail) for ya literature i went though several different emotions while reading this book: shock disbelief finally settling on anger anger yes did the author sit with her editor over tea and crumpets with their twilight copies on their laps pulling plots quotes and carbon copies of the characters did they really think no one would pick up on the similarities well i'll tell you something my twilight copy is open on my lap right now and i am not amused one bit this is something i expect from the usual offender cassie clare not a debut ya author and man i feel so bad writing this review i absolutely hate giving a 1 star review to debut authors but wow i'm just blown this even saw the light of day 
 and what's a twi-fan-fic without insta-love this book has plenty of that and co-dependency keep in mind they have been dating for 2 weeks let me count the ways: 
 ""i feel like i could take on the world when i'm with you"" 
 i felt a new confidence building i could take on the world with him by my side 
 this felt so real it seemed like my future was suddenly very clear i had a whole new purpose--and it all revolved around this boy by my side 
 everything else paled in significance i could not live without him as much as it upset me to hurt the others it was nothing compared to the stabbing pain i felt when i thought of being parted from him 
 and the more time that went by the more i realized i could not live without adam 
 wtf i'm so tired of co-dependent relationships is it a wonder why young girls think they need a boyfriend to survive are these the ideals we want our youth to grow up learning i don't take issue with megan being in love but reading the statements above disturbs me the entire book revolves around how in love she is with adam so don't expect much of a plot in this book the major conflict in the story comes out of nowhere and ends before it even begins just as it did in twilight 
 and omg the mythology it will make your head spin we learn most of the world through god awful info-dumps i read those pages over a few times and i still don't understand perhaps if the author showed the reader instead of telling us maybe i would have been able to keep up the only thing i think i understood was that megan is carrier of a specific gene that would enable her to produce children to bear the mark since carrier's are rare the order (a society that ""looks after"" the marked) specially selects the carrier's mates i suppose being gay is out if you are a carrier because you have a duty to produce babies anyway apparently it is forbidden for adam and megan to be together because if they have a child it could destroy the world yeahi don't get it either once finding that out megan decides she doesn't want to be a marked one anymore and help save the world she wants to be with her romeo 'cause being in love is more important than the safety of the world donchaknow and please don't get me started on the whole 25-year-old pregnancy i can't even 
 fallon you had all this potential the setting was perfect: ireland and you wasted your descriptions on megan eating her wheaties and putting on her red converses *points to face* this is me not giving two shits 
 cait babe you were right 
 i'll leave you with a definition from webster:

 ok i'm done 
 /end rant \(-_-)/ 
 more reviews and more at cuddlebuggery book blog probably my favorite book of 2015 didn't want it to end so i made it last as long as possible i am still #teammaven scroll down to the spoiler portion of my review to read my theory on his redemption arc i'm either right or dead wrong but my gut is telling me to there is more to maven than meets the eye 
 ""mare i am very afraid for you things have been done to you things no person should suffer you've seen horrible things done horrible things and they will change you i'm so afraid for what you could be if given the wrong chance"" 
 enter the world of shades of gray no character will be spared 
 i finished and i have many many thoughts let me try to get them down coherently in gif's (find my review of red queen here): 
 1 first 50% i was mostly bored >>not that the writing wasn't amazing because it was or because there wasn't action because there was but because there was little romance and no maven and no palace and i just wasn't as entertained as the first book but that all changed the second half when things got good 
 2 a certain someone's death hit me harder than expected 
 >> i didn't like this person at all in the first book and now i'm thinking i should read one of the novellas to get more of this character 
 3 i really loved mare in this book 
 >>i'm sure some reviews will say she was moping and angry but honestly she was real mare struggled to make the right decisions and be who they wanted her to be and she was haunted by the events of book one (again this series reminds me a lot of mockingjay-katniss feels but for me that's a wonderful thing because i loved hunger games and would gladly read scenes like that over and over i got why it was so hard of her to let go of protecting killorn and move into some sort of friendship with cal i liked that she didn't know how to interact with the children and people kept looking at her like she was a traitor to both red and silver i liked the way she kept the notes from maven and the way she and cal still mourned the boy they thought they had known 
 4 the ending oh dear lawd that ending now that was an ending 
 his expression is unreadable but his meaning is clear with one hand he points at his feet his fingers whiter than i remember 
 i do as he says 
 i kneel 
 >> read below to understand my thoughts (everything is marked as a spoiler fyi): 
 that ending with maven i sensed it coming but it was just as epic as i hoped i felt less chemistry between mare and cal in this book (even though i'm #teammaven i still loved cal in the first) and while i could be dead wrong here is what i think: 
 victoria is setting us up for a warner-esque (of tahereh mafi's shatter me) love story between mare and maven i know it makes no sense -he committed countless unexcusable crimes (a la darkling and warner)- but do we know for sure that was him do we really did we see him actually hurt anyone in this book no okay well technically he did hurt mare with that branding thing but gah i just feel like there is some sort of explanation maybe somehow it protects her i dunno i just know there is more to the story and all of the bad things that did happen cersei -excuse me elara was still alive and well and do we know why she was in the prison do we really understand what was happening during that prison break out why was her hair graying and her appearance worn i tell you why: because there is more to this whole ""maven is evil"" business than meets the eye i am getting very strong juliette (of shatter me) vibes where mare is going to start to understand or find out more about maven in the next book and help him struggle to redeem himself by the end of the series i am wishing for a hea between m&m but most likely i think she will help save him from himself and end up with cal or alone maven is not pure evil and i don't think he is the villain the way we think he is i think there are other factors at play that will be revealed -like how we thought warner was pure evil in shatter me only to find his actions explained away in the sequels 
 ""no one is born a monster"" but i wish some people were it would make it easier to hate them to kill them to forget their dead faces ""even maven"" i'm sorry but quotes like that hint at my suspicions so well shades of gray people shades of gray 
 >>now maybe you can think this is just wishful thinking your reaction to my prediction is probably this: 
 and you can throw a hundred things maven did in my face and tell me i can't explain all of that away 
 there are people who read shatter me who refused to forgive warner i realize rooting for maven is crazy to a rational eye but in books i tend to love and sympathize with the villain and i'm sorry but reading that ending where mare has given herself over to maven in exchange for everyone's freedom i just know there is so much potential there 
 maybe i'm wrong and he really is a psychopath but i got chills with that ending and it was because of what we might see in the next book i'm sorry but i'm just not getting an epic love story for cal & mare i think she is going to fall for maven & try to save him from himself in the next two books i could be dead wrong and i realize i sound crazy but i'm telling you i think there is more to maven than the villain victoria has been leading us to believe she's a master at twists and i am telling you that i think maven is her trump card i think maven is end game for this series and i do not think he is pure evil even though we've only been offered evidence of the contrary i'm calling it and if i'm wrong well maybe i am but my author instincts are telling me there is more than black and white evil and good this series is going to be about shades of gray 
 final notes: why oh why did i have to wait a whole book to get two scenes with maven i know why because victoria is an evil genius and knows she is torturing us but it's exactly what we need to get amped up for the third book (there's four planned now right) glass sword did have second-book syndrome -it was building to future events and showing us character development and it was absolutely getting us to see how this world truly functioned but it was truly necessary for the stage victoria is planning to set we all saw what she was capable in red queen and i have faith the next two books will be a non-stop rollercoaster of madness now that she has given us all the building blocks and endeared us to all of the characters (i see what you did there) so that she can let blood fly in the next did i love this book more than red queen no but i think victoria did an excellent job preparing us for what's to come and building the world none of us really got to see in the first book eta: i just did my final final read-through of this book and i have to say it was a messy road and a long revision but i am really freaking proud of the result 
 eta: it has a cover 
 sin city plus romeo and juliet minus romance plus monsters 
 this is the strangest book i've ever written i love it 
 it's the story of two teens in a broken world where violent acts breed actual monsters some are shadows with teeth that feed on flesh and bone some are corpses that feed on blood and some can pass for human those feed on souls 
 it's the story of kate harker the only daughter of a crime boss and august flynn the son of a man trying to hold his city together she's a human who wants to be a monster and he's a monster who wishes he were human 
 it's dark and violent and existential and the whole thing was inspired by a line from vicious: 
 ""plenty of humans were monstrous and plenty of monsters knew how to play at being human"" 
 8315: edited to add: and the official title isthis savage song why song 
 remember when i said that august was a monster he's not just any kind of monster but one of only three soul-eaters in the city and these rare creatures (he wouldn't like that word) use music to bring the souls of their prey to surface 
 but it's more than that this book isn't a solo it's a duet a song played by two very different teens trying to survive a very broken world there are moments of discord and a few of harmony and through it all they have to keep the melody alive omg 
 this 
 book 
 has 
 changed 
 me suffice to say apollo you are awesome this book made me literally ""lol"" multiple times and brought a smile to my face seeing old characters i love again yay 
 ill be uploading my review to my youtube channel this week wow that was a great ending to this very fantastical series i cannot wait to go into more detail in my series review which will be out probably next week i'll be covering my opinions on all 5 books and then my overall opinion of the series i am so happy i finally read pjo this was a ""dam"" good series (lol get it ""dam"") ok finally i can talk about this book 
 before i get into it i want to say i learned a big lesson when it comes to sponsored reviews i was approached to do a sponsored review of this book and at the time my only thoughts were ""hell yeah"" 
 i was planning on reading the book anyways so why not be paid the contract i had to sign seemed pretty simple don't spoil things in the book and don't give the book to anyone then i read the book i contacted harper letting them know that my review would not be favorable and i would be raising concerns i had over what i viewed as racist stereotypes then i heard nothing backfor weeks until about 3 weeks later i got an email saying my sponsorship had been dissolved and that per my contract i could not talk about the book until it's release which is now so you better believe i have thoughts 
 *i want to make a note here because some people are confused this was not standard practice for a sponsored review i have never seen or heard of a publisher dissolving a partnership with a booktuber because they didn't like the review which is why i am still very shocked this happened* 
 but now instead of telling you why this book is racist as there are better voices i will direct you to justina ireland who has spoken out about this book - 
 http://justinairelandcom/dammit-this 
 what i want to address is the ableism recently veronica roth did an interview with npr where they discussed how the current gifts in ctm were inspired by chronic pain the interviewer says that chronic pain can be a gift to which roth agrees and goes on to say that part of the book is cyra figuring out why her and others are worthy of pain 
 http://wwwnprorg/templates/transcri 
 * note that roth has said she herself has chronic pain* 
 this to me was so upsetting i have lived with chronic pain now for 7 years it is something that has taken over my life and caused a lot of harm some days it is so bad i can barely sit up let alone get out of bed and to see someone equate it with a gift or say people are worthy of it makes me feel sick whether or not roth has chronic pain herself i am not one to say she is lying that does not take away the harm it is not a magical shield to be pulled out when you've hurt people 
 twitter threads re: chronic pain 
 https://twittercom/heatherezell/stat 
 https://twittercom/sharpegirl/status 
 at this point i don't even care to do a real review of this book i want to put it behind me and never touch on it again should i break out in song and dance to ""baa baa black sheep"" one lonely star i'm just as surprised as you are considering i just knew going into eleanor & park that i would love it love it love it what reason would i have to believe otherwise almost all of my friends loved this book and have sworn fealty to the goddess of feels and might rainbow rowell and i get it because she is a pretty awesome person and i think she is totally lovely so trust me when i say i really wanted to love this book in fact i am blindsided that i didn't saddened that i can't join the eleanor & park kool kidz fan club and disappointed at such a disjointed reading experience 
 random reasons why i didn't like this book: 
 1 the romance 
 my main issue stems from the romance between eleanor and park i just didn't get it though that's not for lack of trying because i had many arguments with adult me and teen me in my brain teen me remembers the infatuation of meeting someone exciting and experiencing all those special moments for the first time however with eleanor and park it was entirely unrealistic and unbelievable 
 park went from ""god just sit the fuck down eleanor"" to ""god she has incredibly soft hands"" 
 eleanor went from ""that stupid asian kid"" to ""he's so pretty i love his hair i want to eat his face"" 
 the next thing i know park is telling eleanor that he's in love with her how he can't imagine being without her that she's it for him then eleanor is telling him she doesn't breathe when she's away from him adult me was not on board because the romance moved entirely too swiftly for my feelings to catch up with the events that were taking place no i take that back ""swiftly"" would indicated that there was some sort of actual pacing involved but that was absent one day they disliked each other and the next they were holding hands and proclaiming their love 
 i remember listening to that part while i was out on a morning run and i had to stop and rewind because i legitimately thought i missed an entire chapter but then i realized that i hadn't and i argued with myself 
 adult me: *twitch* 
 teen me: yeah but remember when you thought you were in love with that guy and how you were going to marry him 
 adult me: yes 
 teen me: so obviously they're not going to be together forever and ever and gallop into the sunset but you can't discount those feelings 
 adult me: *gumbles* i know that but i also never wanted to eat a guy's face 
 teen me: please don't tell me i grow up without a heart 
 adult me:  
 2 the historical background 
 eleanor & park takes place in omaha 1986 where there's racial tension park is half white and half korean he spends most of his time trying not to be noticed by other kids at school and struggling with his own insecurities over his mixed heritage yet oddly throughout the entire novel park doesn't encounter any racism apart from a few brief monologuing sessions about his classmates thinking he was chinese eleanor's off-hand ""stupid asian kid"" remarks and park's own dislike for in his opinion looking too feminine there wasn't anything that felt accurate 
 park's character had so much more potential that was not utilized i was hoping for something more from his development regarding how he viewed himself and his mother perhaps a certain level of acceptance or resolve would have been appropriate 
 there were also two black girls who befriend eleanor but even they don't seem to face any racism in this predominately white neighborhood it was like rowell deliberately tip-toed around them and instead threw in a reference to the community being offended by a black boy getting a white girl pregnant strangely the only one who seemed to get picked on was eleanor i do think it's awesome that this novel had diversity something that is sorely missing in ya but i wasn't buying what rowell was selling 
 at the same time rowell never let you forget that this book was set in the 80s since eleanor & park is overloaded with pop culture references on almost every other page (i admit to chuckling to the 867-5309 reference) still we also never forgot park was asian with eleanor constantly referencing it in her narration to the point that i started feeling uncomfortable 
 3 the narration 
 i wasn't a huge fan of the back and forth narrative and found that it annoyed me more than anything this is where i wonder if my rating is more an indication of how i felt about the audio vs the actual story i disliked both of the narrator's voices the parts of eleanor's dialogue that was ""snarky"" wasn't portrayed with the right kind of emotion park's narration was slightly better but the narrator sunil malhotra bored me to tears with his monotone reading and unbelievable voice for eleanor 
 4 the story 
 i'll be honest and admit that it's possible that i didn't ""get"" this book it may have just gone way over my head why rowell tried to cram a lot of story and situations into one little book and it didn't work for me before going into eleanor & park i was told that the ending was heartbreaking but i didn't feel that at all rowell relies on eleanor's grim family life to spark sympathies from readers and i can see how this works and why it's marketed to john green fans however the ending relies on your connection to their romance to feel the heartbreak the problem with that was by the end i wanted to know what became of eleanor's mom and siblings but the focus was instead on her feelings for park and letting him go eleanor spent a good amount of the story in this terrible environment feeling these feelings and when i genuinely wanted to know her feelings about everything all i get is a freaking post card and the book ends since the romance was doing absolutely nothing for me i needed for the plot to come in and rescue this book it did not 
 i'm not saying this was a terrible book not by a long shot it's clear that this story has touched a lot of people and i wouldn't go as far to not recommend it but i also think this is a bit overhyped i went in with really high expectations thinking i was going to be blown into next week by the awesome instead i'm walking away with feelings brewing a special pot of ""meh"" 
 even still i'm holding out hope for fangirl

 years ago when twilight was in its prime someone told me that breaking dawn was never supposed to happen that it was the book where stephenie meyer was given free reign to do whatever she wanted because the series was so popular everyone would buy it regardless of quality and rake in big dough-cheese for her and her publishers i don't really know how true that assumption is but dammit if isn't true for life and death 
 take me for example: i own all of the twilight books have read twilight (just the first book) a total of 4 times 5 if you include this (and i do) written about some of the good that came of the series (i'm not always a fire-breathing bitch queen) made fun of it enjoyed parts of it loathed chucks of it and everything else in between i also attempted to re-read the series back in 2012 for this little thing i started called project: hindsight and had so much fun reviewing midnight sun (i really wish she'd finish that) but by the time i got to new moon (the book i dislike the most) i just couldn't continue on and abandoned the project 
 over the past few years i've settled on generally disliking everything twilight stands for while holding onto a morbid fascination and begrudgingly bestowing some sort of respect for a series that put ya literature on the map 
 so when i heard of life and death literally the day it released i knew i'd buy it no questions asked i was hoping many of the issues i had with twilight would be corrected with this version it had so much potential to be great i never expected there to be huge drastic changes to the story -- i did expect it to be pretty much the same as twilight so believe me when i say that was the least of its problems 
 i won't bother reviewing this book because it's essentially the same as twilight and i've already written a review for that just swap around the pronouns in your head as you read it 
 in the forward stephenie meyer opens with this: 
 ""but i've always maintained that it would have made no difference if the human were male and the vampire female-- it's still the same story gender and species aside twilight has always been a story about the magic and obsession and frenzy of first love"" 
 i don't think she was very successful there were times when i wondered what meyer was truly trying to accomplish here was she trying to basically say her novel features an unhealthy relationship even with roles reversed as in ""hey guys my book is horrible either way"" or was her goal to further highlight how twilight had a lot of instances of sexism including sexual violence against women because if so then i suppose yeah she was successful 
 here's a general run down: beau is your classic gary stu who falls for the ultimate manic pixie dream girl edythe he has no aspirations to do or be anything until he spots the love of his life in his high school cafeteria not much has changed with our young desperate lovers except for their pronouns but edythe is still a jerk/control freak/stalker and somehow less creepy than edward and beau is still a very weak character and as interesting as the dirt beneath my shoe there is an alternate ending which is essentially a pathetic attempt to pack new moon and eclipse into a clusterfuck of info-dumping but more on that later 
 what i really want to talk about is the treatment of the female characters 
 i don't know how this was even possible but reading life and death actually made me hate twilight even more than i originally did this is mostly because it became shockingly evident that certain scenes (sexual assault) were purposefully left out in this version because the characters didn't have vaginas lovely 
 bella's attempted rape scene has now turned into beau's assault scene if you remember in twilight while bella is getting lost in port angeles she runs into a group of drunk men who attempt to sexually assault her this is made clear by their jeers (""don't be like that sugar"") and edward's later dialogue but for beau his assailants are a mix between female and male and have the intention of beating him up because they think he is a cop the section is entirely re-written with more dialogue a gun and threats of death 
 then there is rosalie's rape scene now changed to royal's assault scene instead of royal being raped he's tricked during the wedding and beat up within an inch of his life now one could argue the time period and say ""well that's happened back then it's just how things were"" and maybe before i read life and death i could have seen that point but when the two biggest instances of female sexual assault are completely left out when you swap the genders oy that's an issue 
 now that is not to say i wanted to see men get rape in life and death it's just a glaring problem where i now see those scenes as ""literary rape"" used as plot devices to add depth and sympathy to rosalie's character and to give edward a reason to look super heroic in the face of rapists maggie stiefvater said it best in this is a post about literary rape: 
 ""i'm talking about novels where the rape scene could just as easily be any other sort of violent scene and it only becomes about sex because there's a woman involved if the genders were swapped a rape scene wouldn't have happened the author would've come up with a different sort of scenario/ backstory/ defining moment for a male character"" 
 that is exactly what happened here 
 one could argue that meyer wrote a more progressive version of twilight with life and death and that's partly true to an extent edythe does appear to try to make her relationship with beau as equal as possible but there are constant references to the gender changes as if meyer is trying to prove something to the reader and they only seemed to further resign me to the fact that meyer has no idea what she's doing (bold is mine) 
 his straight gold hair was wound into a bun on the back of his head but there was nothing feminine about it-- somehow it made him look even more like a man 
 i fumbled for my wallet 
 ""um let me-- you didn't even get anything--"" 
 ""my treat beau"" ""but--"" 
 ""try not to get caught up in antiquated gender roles"" 
 she turned toward the cafeteria swinging her bag into place 
 ""hey let me get that for you"" i offered 
 she looked up at me with doe eyes ""does it look too heavy for me"" 
 ""well i mean"" 
 ""sure"" she said she slid the bag down her arm and then held it out to me very deliberately using just the tip of her pinkie finger 
 it was like meyer was shouting me ""do i impress you"" and i kept going: 
 in the hands of a more skilled writer this might have been pulled off flawlessly i found the changes she made with beau's narration interesting meyer mentioned in the forward that bella is more flowery with her words where beau is not this is a complete understatement the one thing twilight actually had going for it was the occasionally pretty quote i say occasional because the novel contains too many short simple sentences than i usually like in my books in life and death's case the writing has been watered down so much that it feels on par with see spot run and i don't necessarily think this is a gender thing just because a character is a boy doesn't mean he can't be articulate or well-versed 
 ""bonnie there's something you didn't know about me i used to smell really good to vampires"" 
 corny so very corny 
 it's not uncommon to discover popular ya authors' inability to write convincing male povs *cough*veronica roth*cough* and i learned from midnight sun that it's not exactly meyer's forte either but c'mon this was really bad even for her 
 the there's beau's obsession with edythe's unhealthy* body oh god i'm so disgusted with this part and i don't really understand why it was included 
 ""her pale arms her slim shoulders the fragile-looking twigs of her collarbones the vulnerable hollows above them the swanlike column of her neck the gentle swell of her breasts-- don't stare don't stare-- and the ribs i could nearly count under the thin cotton she was too perfect i realized with a crushing wave of despair there was no way this goddess could ever belong with me"" 
 is this supposed to show beau's unrealistic expectations of women's bodies that only vampires can achieve this level of ""perfection"" that society constantly forces on us because there is no other explanation that works well here and i'm really trying to give meyer the benefit of the doubt and throw her a bone the issue with this theory is there's no indication in the book that this is an unrealistic view actually quite the opposite happens later in that same scene: 
 i had a new definition of beauty 
 sigh i don't think i need to go into why this is problematic so i'll just leave that there for your critique 
 *unhealthy as in for majority of women this is an unattainable beauty standard apologies if that came off as body shaming women/girls where that is their healthy i'm speaking specifically about society's constant pressure on women and girls to be as thin as possible many times to the detriment of their physical and emotional health when beau describes edythe he focuses so heavily on the sharp angles of her bones and it perpetuates the idea that these characteristics make her more beautiful than others i find these descriptions irresponsible and feel there could have been a better way to describe her 
 so let's talk about the ending this part will have spoilers beyond this point this is your one and only warning 
 yes it's re-written -- horribly if i'm being honest during the scene with the ballet studio (which btw beau didn't take ballet as a kid because he's a boy *eyeroll*) everything is pretty much similar expect for the fact that edythe can't suck out all the venom out of beau's body leaving him only one possible future: becoming a vampire super early and living happily ever after with his bae edythe 
 i wouldn't have had an issue with the change if it had actually been written without the massive amounts of info-dumping it reads like meyer decided last minute that she wanted to only do 2 chapters of the gender swap (which she mentions in the forward) realized she spent all of her deadline time on re-writing the entire book and quickly wrote an ending hours before she emailed it to her editor 
 she crams the werewolf history volturi history rules of being a vampire and beau's human funeral altogether and it's just so goddamn messy it also makes the insta-love look even worse because at least bella had 3 other books and a pining jacob to consider leaving edward it was just an overall hot ass mess that seemed so out of place this is why i said they just let meyer do whatever the hell she wants; half that stuff would have never flown with a debut novel or any novel that desired to actually be you know good 
 would i recommend this and should you read it hard to say my first response is ""oh god no don't waste your money"" $1299 is an unacceptable price for an ebook (thank goodness for kindle returns) it doesn't really offer anything vital to the twilight fandom/universe and is generally a horrible piece of writing that i want to fling stones at but then the other half of me enjoys the suffering of my fellow book lovers and is considering purchasing this as a gag joke to both of my lovely co-bloggers because that's really all this trite wish-fulfilling wankfest of a re-imaginging is good for and i really really need to stop being so damn curious about everything but anyway i'm rambling when all i really want to say is the ball's in your court now el james i eagerly await your newest fan fiction original book do you remember that taylor swift song about romeo and juliet love story 
 it's lyrics go something like this: 
 i'm a pretty little girl who knows nothing about literature 
 so i sing a song about starcrossed lovers 
 whose only problem is that daddy doesn't approve 
 but it's all good because we get married anyway 
 just like that cliffnote's story about romeo and juliet 
 yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeyyyyy 
 we have a tendency with ya literature today to have stories with the super duper happiest of happy endings where everything works out and true love's only real complications are external difficulties and self-esteem issues for the girl 
 i'm trying to think of the perfect example here and because this review is full of cheap shots at easy targets i'm going to go with 
 twilight 
 come on down bella and edward 
 now don't get me wrong there's nothing wrong with happy endings and butterflies and rainbows and kittens they're lovely lovely things and in the hands of an accomplished author they do well there's also nothing wrong with having a relationship that's troubled by only external forces once again in the right hands it's fine i'm not being a miserly old grinch here okay maybe a little bit but moving on 
 the problem is that in real life relationships are usually impacted by internal factors so when you base your story on perfection that can only be tainted by evil people trying to destroy your true love and twist the story to finally reach that happily ever after then what you sacrifice is often the very real almost-tangible relatable emotions that a more realistic thoughtful storyline could bring 
 and also romeo and juliet is a tragedy taylor swift 
 thank you kieran culkan you're a fresh breeze amongst the stagnant world of apathetic performers 
 now what i love about laini taylor other than everything is that this woman is made of fairytales i swear she's like woven together by sweet kisses and dewdrops she's been sung into being by blind minstrels bathed in moonlight she's wrapped in gossamer and shrived in pure white swan feathers you know all that magical shit she's that the woman is magic and she writes magic if anyone could take romeo and juliet mate it with a ya paranormal romance and produce a love child that people don't want to drown at birth - then it would be laini taylor 
 this book is powerful emotive heart breaking anguishing 
 what i'm sayingthe point i'm trying to make herethe truth is laini taylor kicked my heart in the ass 
 and i liked it 
 this review can also be found on my blog cuddlebuggery book blog wallflower (noun) 
 a shy or retiring person who remains unnoticed at social events especially a woman without a dance partner 
 i decided to read this book not because there was going to be a movie coming out soon 
 it one of the reasons but then again it wasn't the main one 
 i wanted to read it because the word ""wallflower"" caught my attention 
 i was a wallflower 
 i was not one of those kids people notice immediately 
 i was one of those people who blends in very well that i was no longer noticeable 
 i was a ""nobody"" 
 i was one of those uncool kids back in high school that almost no one spoke to because i always kept to myself 
 i was insecure 
 i was scared that if i try to talk no one would listen 
 actually i think i still am even though i am already working 
 i am still a ""nobody"" here 
 i have a couple of friends but it seems like no one really knows who i really am because i never let them find out who i really was 
 they know my name and a couple of unimportant things but i think that's about it 
 they don't really care about the things i like the things that make me cry the things that make me smile 
 i was just another person they knew by name but never really knew at all 
 perks of being a wallflower has to be one of the books that i could relate to 
 it was very insightful and poignant that in most part of this book i felt like it was me writing those letters 
 charlie (the main character) and i don't have very much in common but still i found myself relating to his situation almost all throughout the book 
 i was not as introverted nor was i as smart as he was but there was something about how the author wrote him that you'll start to see the world through his eyes 
 you'll see how innocent and pure his outlook was in life 
 charlie wasn't normal and he knew it 
 he was struggling after the death of his favorite aunt 
 he tried his best to ""participate"" but there is still this part of him that would be locked away from everyone else 
 charlie was a freshman and he still has a lot of things to learn 
 hanging out with patrick and sam (who were both seniors) exposed him to a lot of things he wasn't used to (like smoking drinking making out those sort of stuff) 
 his letters mirrors the experience or the things we went through during his first year in high school 
 as i was saying earlier i loved this book a lot because i related much with not only the character but with the whole story 
 we may not be like charlie but the things he went through in high school were something almost everyone went through 
 i didn't do drugs nor did i smoke a lot when i was in high school 
 but some kids were motivated in doing so by peer pressure but in charlie's case i think it was more of curiosity rather than peer pressure 
 this book showed us how a special kid like charlie would cope with being in high school and overcoming the problems he would encounter as he goes along 
 another thing i loved about this book was how it was written 
 though it was written back in the 90's when you read it you'll get this impression that it was just written recently in a 90's setting 
 this book was transcend time 
 when you read it probably in the next 10 years you would still be able to relate to it 
 there were a lot of good quotations in this book but one really stood out for me: 
 so i guess we are who we are for a lot of reasons and maybe we'll never know most of them but even if we don't have the power to choose where we come from we can still choose where we go from there we can still do things and we can try to feel okay about them 
 we are all different 
 we are also all the same 
 most of us may not be as smart as charlie or as popular as brad (who i think was an a**hole) but all of us can still make a difference 
 we may be experiencing troubles right now but that could change based on the decisions or choices that we would make 
 i don't think this is much of a review but more of a rant 
 sorry my dear readers if this review disappointed you but i kind of like sharing my thoughts about a book that i really connected with 
 this book was one of them 
 i give this book 5 wonderful glittery stars so allie is an orphaned teenager in a dystopian fantasy where people are enslaved by vampire masters then she gets turned into a vampire and struggles with the morality of being a monster 
 so at first i was like 
 but then she was like 
 a comparable representation on the scale of awesomeness - not a literal depiction 
 and then i was like 
 right away from the beginning of the novel allie was pretty ass kicking 
 and then kanin the vampire showed up and i was like 
 yeah sure whatevs 
 but then he was like 
 and then i was like 
 so then allie goes trekking through the woods and i'm like 
 and then she meets up zeke and i was like 
 then zeke is like ewwww vampires suck and i was like 
 then stuff with them happened and i was like 
 so then i was worried about the writing since i'd been on the fence about the iron fey but then kagawa did a lot of: 
 and i was like 
 and then stephanie said the plot was slow and i was like 
 and then i got to the end and allie was like 
 so i was like 
 this review also appears on our blog cuddlebuggery i have to mention this: my friend anna who doesn't read that much (if it's not harry potter) read ttf and called me once she finished with a wicked book hangover 
 so proud of her i didn't like this book 
 this is not what i expected to be i hoped to find a book in the style of stargirl (or something novel) and what did i find a bunch of teens who try to ease their anxieties in their not-so-original vices and a sudden drama which leads to nonsense talking all hiding of course in a couple of beautiful quotes that wrap all the 'inspiring-sites' on the internet the reason i got to the book and i bet that you too 
 boring it was so so boring 
 i didn't like the characters alaska was unbearable (oh no wait she was awesome if you were a character too: fantastic girlbeautiful and wonderful and ohmarrymerightnowplease and she had to be an intelligent woman so the author made her feminist and an avid reader to prove she had brains) and there is no need to write about the boys because booh 
 the main character was a cronic linnet who got lost in his difficulties (mostly not having a girlfriend such a big problem you see) and searching the great perhaps thing he forgot to do so easily so 
 what a waste of time 
 2013 edit: almost four years have passed since i read and reviewed looking for alaska and i hope nobody expects me to discuss anything related to the book it's great if you loved the book but i didn't maybe at this time of my life i would express myself in a different way but when i wrote this i was convinced of all i said before 
 after looking for alaska i read other john green's books and i loved some of them like really did it's sad that looking for alaska didn't work for me but i think it is wonderful that it did for you not so many books can inspire that kind of passion :_) 
 thanks everybody for your likes and comments and my apologies for not answering them anymore i feel empowered by that book especially the fight scenes so ba this was the coolest the unique format is what really makes this book stand out but even without that aspect it's still a fantastic read going into it i didn't know a whole lot but i'd only heard praise and after reading it i get it so many awesome elements and surprises--i had no idea where the story would end up but i loved getting there awesome world great characters intense moments it was funny and creepy and again just plain cool 
 one of my faves of the year definitely recommended especially if you're looking for something different or you love a good sci-fi story romantic and adorable with a perfect balance of heart-wrenching moments endlessly hopeful yet still grounded in reality pretty much everything i want from a ya contemporary i'm two for two with nicola yoon books read and loved so there's no doubt i'll be reaching for her next novel as soon as it comes out now with spoilery rant @ bottom 
 hush hush is the story of nora grey an average high school student going about her business as usual -- until her biology teacher rearranges the class seating and places her next to the dangerous-looking new kid patch cipriano nora gets a weird feeling from patch and things just keep going from bad to worse as nora becomes convinced that she is being stalked and may even be the target of murderous intentions add to the list nora's strange feelings about the archangel ride at the amusement park and her constant near death experiences and well nora's life is becoming anything but average 
 when i finished reading hush hush i had to mull it over for awhile i really wasn't sure what to say i am absolutely enthralled by the cover (athletic looking darkly mysterious fallen angel contorted in mid-air in grayscale what's not to like) i had to have it because of that cover* but i had a sneaking suspicion that a cover that good had to be masking something yep it's a bright light to dazzle the eyes and make you *ahem* overlook any faults 
 it didn't work 
 inside was the most confused schizophrenic piece of writing i've read in some time becca fitzpatrick didn't seem to know quite what she wanted only that it had to be ominous and scary and dangerous -- and titillating of course and mysterious and sexy so with those buzz words in mind she threw a bunch of things together and let her narrator nora sort them out nora understandably had some trouble with this and the result is a thoroughly frustrating heroine who jumps to insane conclusions based on inane evidence one moment and the next goes blithely along into obvious danger 
 patch is intriguing and perhaps the most consistent character** and i was fully prepared for an 'anti-hero as the hero' story i wanted a little boundary-pushing and a not entirely likeable or trustworthy male lead who may or may not redeem himself but who gives you the dangerous and alluring in spades for the most part patch wasn't a let-down in this regard and as screwed up as it is to like him he was the stand-out character for me (not to say i didn't have issues with him too) 
 but it wasn't enough patch's bad boy antics couldn't save this book from itself it was self-indulgent cheesy melodramatic in the worst sense and confusing i wanted to like it; i loved the fallen angel premise the idea of an anti-hero and bits and pieces of the writing throughout but hush hush suffered from too many villains and too much shock and awe and not enough thought and follow-through maybe fitzpatrick can pull it together for round two and with some strong convincing by trusted like-minded people i may be willing to give her another chance (never gonna happen) but this was a monstrous let-down for me you've been warned*** 
 *we all know how that whole so-pretty-i-just-had-to thing works out see my guest post on jo's blog about this 
 **and by 'consistent' i mean he was consistently a douche vee was pretty consistent too and was a lot of fun but she started to get annoying and a little strange 
 ***you're still going to read it aren't you damn you james porto and your beautiful beautiful cover 
 ***here thar be spoilers*** 
 if you haven't read hush hush and intend to or if you don't want me dissing the melodrama that is patch and nora look awaynow 
 commence rant: 
 you already know i had issues with this book i think a lot of people are going to take offense to the idea of patch as the hero as teen girls' fantasy just as they did with edward in twilight patch goes beyond the simple term ""bad boy"" in that yes he does actually mean nora harm consistently 
 i'm not going to go into that because frankly i don't care he can be an anti-hero all he wants whatever if that's where the story's going fine most of my issues -- but not all -- lie with nora 
 here's the thing: 
 nora is that girl you yell at in the horror movie the idiot that goes up the stairs instead of out the door or reaches to turn over the downed bad guy just to make sure we all know that's frustrating but we've come to expect it in movies and that dumb big-breasted scantily clad girl normally gets killed off 
 nora is so much more frustrating than that 
 the many sides of nora: she continually suspects patch (and elliot and just about everyone else in this story) and with good reason however she then continually ignores her instincts and puts herself in danger in fact she can't seem to agree with herself she will think to herself that patch is stalking her and trying to kill her and then within pages think 'oh but he could never hurt me' this just cycles and cycles throughout the story 
 also throughout the story nora makes insane jumps in logic -- whether they turn out to be true or not it's not believable when she immediately jumps to the most bizarre conclusions and then acts on them at the same time she will be directly confronted with some piece of real evidence something that would make a normal non-fictional person take notice and say something's not right here -- and she will completely ignore it it's like she's being willfully obtuse 
 examples: 
 * early(ish) in the story nora hears a voice in her head and thinks patch has ""breached normal communication methods and could at will speak to me without ever opening his mouth"" naturally she thinks she's delusional hearing your name and a few inane comments would make one think they are imagining things and this i could buy even nora not being exactly sure what happened and being creeped out i could buy but she proceeds to ask patch how he's able to speak directly to her mind making her look like a loon 
 i wouldn't be even all that bothered by this if it was consistent throughout the story; if nora either consistently thought that she was going crazy because of all the implausible things that are happening i could buy it; if she wanted to prove she wasn't crazy and kept confronting patch and sleuthing i could buy it it would be 1 solid choice on becca fitzpatrick's part she could be the ultra-paranoid girl who thinks she's going crazy and jumps to conclusions about everything annoying but doable but to present this as if it's normaland i'm out 
 * conversely near the near the end of the story when the shit's really beginning to go down and nearly everyone has become a villain nora and patch walk out of a movie theater to find that ""both the tires on the driver's side were flat: '""i can't believe it"" i said ""i drove over two nails""' 
 o_o 
  
 she thinks she's being stalked she thinks her best friend has been kidnapped by a teenaged murderer named elliot and by this point she thinks she's the target of not one but two murderous angels and yet all she can come up with is that she ran over two nails come on if nora will jump to conclusions on the barest of evidence how in hell does she not comprehend the obvious 
 * throughout the story nora thinks everyone's out to get her (she's right but i'll get to that) especially patch patch is ominous capital 'o' and yetand yet no matter how much nora thinks he's badbadbad she trusts him why 
 weirdest of all when nora confronts patch about his intentions 
 he admits he wanted to kill her 
 ; her reaction 'i know patch could never hurt me' -- and she trusts him implicitly from that point on really the whole story you've suspected him and been insistent that you should stay away on the barest of evidence but once he's confessed his (albeit previous) intentions of murder you trust him 
 really 
  her sudden bizarre trust of patch comes too late for any real belief in their romance or her sanity 
 there is no consistency in nora's thinking i just can't understand why becca fitzpatrick couldn't pick one nora to write and stick with her 
 she could have just always thought she was losing her mind; self-doubt would have been interesting and made her root-forable 
 if she had just been reckless and always convinced that yes maybe something is a little off about patch but she still found herself attracted to him it would have been interesting and could have been used to slowly reveal the truth and up nora's anxiety 
 if nora had just been naive and always convinced that everything was fine despite any indicators it would have built tension 
 but combining it all made nora seem confused and a little off herself and made the writing seem schizophrenic 
 too many villains: fitzpatrick makes the rookie mistake of lack of restraint nora suspects everyone and everyone does in fact seem to be a villain this makes the book seem unfocused and sort of cheesy when everyone is under suspicion and everyone seems to be a bad guy it makes it seem like no one really is it's like if you use a really great word once or twice it's going to stand out but if every word you use is some great unusual word none are going to stand out there's no negative space no background to make the focal point pop everywhere nora turns someone's trying to kill her it just gets silly after awhile also it has the added negative effect of making it hard for fitzpatrick to ""top"" as it were where does she go from here if there are 4 different people trying to kill nora in book 1 how many people will there be out for blood in book 2 she didn't leave any room to grow the suspense 
 another bad thing about the amount of villains and nora's instant suspicion (and the overall over-the-top nature of the book) was that there was precious little suspense by giving everything away rather freely fitzpatrick deprived the reader of the slow build-up and the privilege of the mystery; we never got to have any suspicions of our own or choose sides there was too much in the way of ominous overtones and not enough restraint 
 on a side note not that i'm calling vee a villain but even she became a little weird* as the story went on it's one thing to be the wild and crazy girl in the best friends dynamic but constantly trying to get your best friend alone with a guy who she says makes her uncomfortable who she believes broke into her house and may be stalking her and who she knows was a murder suspect is reckless beyond the pale and shitty shitty friendship 
 *by which i mean she goes from being quirky and funny to a godawful shitty friend you know for no other reason than apparently to help lure nora into bad/ridiculous situations plot device: 
 the writing overall: i saw glimpses in fitzpatrick's writing that demonstrated how this could have been a good book she does sexual tension and confrontation scenes fairly well and there is some good humor vee -- in the beginning at least before she becomes a really reckless really bad friend -- was pretty amusing as the traditional sidekick patch had great one-liners both funny and smoldering 
 but for all the occasional good there was quite a bit in the way of bad the dialogue was often stilted and weird the analogies were completely out of left field they were those turns of phrase that you can tell were used because they sounded cool or because one was needed but they don't mean anything or they leave you thinking wtf ""his eyes looked like they didn't play by the rules"" what does that even mean what rules do eyes usually play by does he not blink this is a mild example but i got sick of making note of them i got this really hit-and-miss feel about the writing and the language in the book pieces of literary crap mixed in with the really good bits blended to form a ""throw it all in and something's bound to work"" style a total lack of finesse made it hard to want to keep reading -- and made me feel like if i kept rolling my eyeballs they were going to roll right out of my head 
 rant complete so much yes falling kingdoms crushed my heart but exceeded all my expectations so good if you love high fantasy do yourself a favor and read this book saw the movie loved it came home and immediately read this in one sitting i was in fantastic beasts binge mode and it was like seeing the movie again the story is brilliant and there's so much great detail in the screenplay plus the actual physical edition of this book is absolutely gorgeous 
 i do suggest seeing the movie first (it's so fun and visually stunning--go see it) and the screenplay doesn't add much new stuff (a few little details and confirmations you might not pick up watching the movie) but still this is definitely a wonderful addition to my collection of wizarding world things another amazing novel by rick riordan cant wait to start the next novel and see how this all ends this was so great i absolutely love the world building--there's a cool magic system and lots of different cities/cultures that have really fascinating dynamics the ensemble cast of characters is also fantastic they all have interesting backstories and distinct personalities writing is great story is awesome pacing on point it wasn't quite perfect but it was pretty freaking close and i can't wait for the sequel 
 if you want a fantasy book with an awesome world a well developed cast of characters and an exciting heist storyline--this is definitely the book for you my video review - https://wwwyoutubecom/watchv=rbgmr 
 this was awesome it did take me a little bit to really get into it but once i was in i was so in it was so atmospheric and i was really impressed with the details and the amount of research that had to go into writing this the time travel aspect was fascinating and just straight up cool i loved our two main characters and was so happy that we got to see from both of their povs and that ending let's just say i'm eagerly anticipating book 2 
 if you're looking for a cool time travel book or you love atmospheric stories with rich settings and historical details or if you just want to read an awesome 'questing through time' type adventure this is probably the book for you ""you ask how much of it was me"" he whispers ""some enough"" 
 dear mare stop picking the wrong brother 
 ***warning spoilers abound do not continue with this review unless you have read the book**** 
 first of all i called it i knew that we'd be getting lots of maven and seeing the boy behind the villain's mask in this one and praise the book gods i'm so glad victoria didn't let me down she gave us all those moments we hoped for the explanation the moments of fragility the tension everything she gave me a beautiful tragic tormented villain who fell in love with the wrong girl 
 i say wrong because mare does not deserve this darkling this twisted warner of a king her reaction to his kiss during the vulnerable tenuous moment between the two was what finally convinced me to give up on their love story (whereas in shatter me you could pick up on something in warner & juliette's kiss here there's nothing it's gone alright i get the message mare feels nothing but disgust it's a ""violation of the worst kind"" -she's in control and she'll never pick the villain) while i have never felt the spark between mare and cal (yup even in this book including that scene) she's never going to be maven's that's fine i'll take him mare doesn't deserve him even though maven is more like her than cal will ever be 
 this is a boy who was crippled from birth by an evil woman so terrible he doesn't know what thoughts are his i just want him to have a happily ever after but there is none this boy is darkness incarnate and i have a feeling he's going to end up doing something noble to save cal or mare or his people in the next (final) book (to redeem himself the only way a villain can) and i just can't cope 
 the first book is still my favorite but king's cage gave me so many beautiful twisted lines victoria is a master of powerful prose and she delivered some exceptional ones --as you might expect my favorite ones were his 
 ""love makes you weak and she's right i learned that before i even knew you"" 
 ""i'm not a fool little lightning girl if you're going to play in my head i'm going to play in yours it's what we're good at"" 
  i could try to write a review of this entire book but let's be honest i read it for maven and i don't have the heart to write everything up because i'm in mourning for a ship that will never sail 
 (yes i realize maven does not have blonde hair but this gif fits perfectly) 
 #teammaven holy crap my favorite book in this series so far ugh so good an ember in the ashes is truly a unique and captivating book that i recommends everybody reads cannot wait for the second book in this series =d there are two kinds of books those that you finish reading and leave you with fleeting memories of the attractive hero the silly heroine and the overall storyline or perhaps all you noted was the glaring plot holes inconsistencies ridiculousness or flat characters at any rate it's a book that you read either like or dislike but no sooner than you have turned the last page it is out of sight and out of mind then there is the other kind of book that will touch your heart or awaken a lingering memory or a potential fear that will haunt your mind so that even long after you've fallen asleep your unconscious self is still wading through the details your dreams will be fitful and when you finally awaken you will find yourself tangled up in sheets with puffy swollen eyes from tears that you shed when you weren't even aware enough to know you were crying if i stay is the latter 
 mia is eighteen and has the kind of family any of us would pray to be born to and the kind of boyfriend that can only exist in the fictitious world furthermore she is a gifted musician and is about to be accepted into the prestigious julliard mia has a choice she can follow her love of music go to julliard and accomplish her cellist dreams or she can stay with her family and the love of her life and follow her heart either way she has something to gain and something to lose then one fateful morning mia's world is turned on its head and life as she knows it changes the one thing that remains the same is the question that mia has asked herself for the past few months should i go or should i stay 
 in art the brightest colors appear beside the darkest of lines and in this book the most endearing tender and happy moments are surrounded by grief so palpable that you will laugh through your tears and sob with a smile if i stay demonstrates the kind of beauty that can only exist alongside despair and shines all the more for it it is filled with happiness and sorrow laughter and tears birth and death love and loss by writing a book filled with parallels forman proves that life has no opposite and thus leaves readers with an overwhelming since of joy and hope despite tears and grief that they are bound to feel 
 **update** i just re-read this book for the forth time and it continues to devastate and delight me this series is so cool i love the setting the characters the story and especially the format piecing together the story through these ""hacked"" documents and messages just makes for an awesome reading experience and i cannot wait for book 3 this was so great it was funny and adorable and just left me with the biggest smile plastered on my face it did take me a little bit to get into the story because there were so many characters i had trouble keeping them straight at times but the main character simon is well developed and relatable and really grounded the story i thought the mystery was great (and was so excited when i correctly guessed who blue was) and i liked that despite the blackmail and the tension it was still a mostly lighthearted uplifting kind of book 
 overall i really enjoyed this i didn't love it quite as much as i've loved books by stephanie perkins and rainbow rowell but i definitely felt that it was along those same lines looking forward to reading more from this author ""gansey"" a pause ""that's all there is"" 
 how much can i rave about these books 
 this review contains *spoilers* 
 i've been waiting for this moment for months now but i can finally say that i've finished reading the raven king i was so nervous going into this because my expectations were sky-high but it is everything i could've dreamed it to be and more i felt like my heart was cracking throughout this whole experience 
 depending on where you began the story it was about gansey and the revelation that he knows that this might be his last year to find the king and complete his ongoing quest once and for all 
 the raven king is set a week after the events of the last book maura is back home with artemus who knows more than he is saying and is acting rather peculiar- especially when gwenllian is around and blue and her raven boys are still on their quest to find the king 
 the uncertainty over everything kept me on the edge for the entire story it felt like the end of everything 
 i was hooked as soon as i read the first sentence and i was so into the story that i couldn't stop reading until the last page (and i unfortunately had a huge headache after reading so much) 
 but i laughed i cried i mourned 
 what more could i ask of stiefvater a master storyteller 
 she creates these atmospheric impressionistic scenes with this quiet but impeccable style 
 i want everyone to know her talents but i don't want to share her with anyone 
 for the past month i've talked and ranted so much about these characters that even my mom got invested and was waiting for me to tell her what happened in the final book (by the way she said that gansey wasn't going to die) (thanks mom for believing) 
 as i mentioned before it starts with gansey's incredibly rich and unique tale and continues with his found family 
 ""where the hell is ronan"" gansey asked echoing the words that thousands of humans had uttered since mankind developed speech"" 
 what is my review worth without mentioning ronan too many times 
 but seriously he continues to amaze me and he's just an all-time favorite of mine that i won't be letting go of any time soon 
 also i'm in love with this fanart of him: 
 source 
 ""gansey asked ""do you have time to run an errand with us do you have work homework"" 
 ""no homework i got suspended"" blue replied 
 ""get the fuck out"" ronan said but with admiration ""sargent you asshole"" 
 blue reluctantly allowed him to bump fists with her as gansey eyed her meaningfully in the rearview mirror"" 
 my life i love ronan too much my new goal is for him to say the exact same things to me 
 ""for what"" 
 ""emptying another student's backpack over his car i don't really want to talk about it"" 
 ""i do"" ronan said 
 ""well i don't i'm not proud of it"" 
 ronan patted her leg ""i'll be proud for you"" 
 he's seriously the best 
 ""strange he hadn't had a premonition of what this place would become to him all those months ago "" 
 adam perfectly described how i feel about this series these books have become my home and i cannot believe it took me so long to discover i love it in a way that nearly overwhelms me with gratitude 
 i also loved that this book focused on the romance (among many other happenings) and it was slow uncertain and exquisitely written my heart is still happy and beating like crazy 
 ""each of the trees they passed sounded with a processed thud until the sound around them was the pulsing electronic beat that invariably played in ronan's car or headphones 
 ""oh god"" gansey said but he was laughing ""do we have to endure that here too ronan"" 
 ""it wasn't me"" ronan said he looked to blue who shrugged he caught adam's eye when adam's mouth quirked ronan's expression stilled for a moment before turning to the loose smile he ordinarily reserved for matthew's silliness adam felt a surge of both accomplishment and nerves he skated an edge here making ronan lynch smile felt as charged as making a bargain with cabeswater these weren't forces to play with"" 
 and while i'm on the topic of ronan i finally got to see him with his brothers and it was too good to be true i was so happy maggie included it 
 ""where are you in your room"" 
 ""dur"" 
 ""i'm serious"" 
 ""hur"" 
 ""matthew"" 
 ""yah yah i'm in my room sl hates you it's like two or sumthin' whatdya want"" 
 ronan didn't reply right away matthew couldn't see him but he was curled on his bed back at monmouth forehead resting on his knees one hand gripping the back of his own skull phone pressed to his ear ""just to know you're all right"" 
 "" 'm all right"" 
 ""go to sleep then"" 
 ""still sleeping now"" 
 the brothers hung up"" 
 ronan is seriously messing me up i love him with all my heart 
 and another favorite part in this book was when declan and ronan finally sat down and just talked 
 ""declan started: ""we need to talk about your future"" 
 ""no"" ronan said ""no no we don't"" 
 he was already most of the way out of the car leaves snapping dead under his shoes 
 ""ronan wait"" 
 ronan did not wait 
 ""ronan before he died when he and i were out together dad told me a story about you"" 
 it was wickedly unfair 
 it was wickedly unfair because there was nothing else that would have stopped ronan from walking away"" 
 why does his childhood make me cry 
 ""declan paused then sighing as if the weight of the story was a tangible thing and he needed to take a moment to regain his strength it was true that the memory of the ritual was heavy enough ronan was all tangled up in half-formed images of his father sitting on the end of matthew's bed the brothers tumbled together at its head his mother perched on that tatty desk chair no one else would sit at she loved these stories too especially the ones about her"" 
 i really love hearing about his childhood 
 ""on the outside the three lynch brothers appeared remarkably dissimilar: declan a butter-smooth politician; ronan a bull in a china-shop world; matthew a sunlit child 
 on the inside the lynch brothers were remarkably similar: they all loved cars themselves and each other"" 
 ronan and his family are unlike anyone else and i love how everyone is involved in this book and that the adults care about the kids and vice versa and nobody is excluded and it's just great great great 
 also great great great were adam and ronan: 
 ""what are you trying to find out"" 
 adam described the circumstances surrounding his eye and his hand with the same level tone he would use to answer a question in class he allowed ronan to lean in to compare his eyes - close enough that ronan felt his breath on his cheek - and he allowed ronan to study the palm of his hand the latter was not strictly necessary and they both knew it but adam watched ronan closely as he lightly traced the lines there"" 
 maggie knows exactly where to hit home for me 
 ""why are we here"" he asked 
 ""wrong devil"" adam replied quietly 
 it had not been that long since the court case against his father he knew that ronan remained righteously furious over the outcome: robert parrish a first-time offender in the eyes of the court had walked away with a fine and probation "" 
 ""what ronan didn't realize was that the victory hadn't been in the punishment adam didn't need his father to go to jail he had merely needed someone outside the situation to look at it and confirm that yes a crime had been committed adam had not invented it spurred it deserved it it said so on the court paperwork robert parrish guilty adam parrish free"" 
 i love adam and yes he continues to break my heart adam is the one i related to the most and i'm so proud of him and his character growth and i love how ronan and adam support one another 
 i was barely recovering from them when i got to see gansey and blue being so sweet all i can say is that gansey has got a way with words 
 ""it was this: gansey starting down the stairs to the kitchen blue starting up meeting in the middle it was gansey stepping aside to let her pass but changing his mind he caught her arm and then the rest of her she was warm alive vibrant beneath the thin cotton; he was warm alive vibrant beneath his blue slid her hand over his bare shoulder and then on to his chest her palm spread out flat on his breastbone her fingers pressed curiously into his skin 
 i thought you would be hairier she whispered 
 sorry to disappoint the legs have a bit more going on 
 mine too"" 
 i'm really glad he and blue stopped trying to hide their relationship from the group and gansey being as maggie said in her recap a dick but not a dick: 
 ""he gathered himself adam saw his gaze land on blue judging perhaps whether or not she knew what he was about to say or whether he should say it he touched his thumb to his lower lip caught himself at it lowered his hand 
 ""blue and i have been seeing each other"" he said ""i don't want to hurt any feelings but i want to keep seeing her i don't want to hide it any more it's eating me and nights like this having to stand here and look at blue with her face like this and pretend like --"" he drew himself to a stop a full stop a silence so intense that no one tipped any other sound into it then he finished repeating ""i cannot ask you to do things i haven't been doing myself i'm sorry for being a hypocrite"" 
 ""blue took gansey's hand 
 adam was glad she did 
 ""gross"" ronan said which was the most juvenile response possible 
 but gansey said ""thanks for the input ronan"" with a proper look on his face again and adam saw how cleverly ronan had released the tension of the moment they could all breathe again"" 
 this is exactly why i love ronan so much if anyone asked me why i would just show this one quote 
 i think this book might be my favorite in the series because so much happened and i am in awe by maggie stiefvater's ability to write something so beautiful and descriptive so exciting and so heartbreaking 
 and as she also promised in her recap henry cheng shows up more and i really liked him in this book which i honestly wasn't expecting 
 ""what are you doing here"" blue demanded she was feeling - she wasn't sure she was feeling a lot 
 ""i'm here to talk about the men in your life to talk about the men in my life i like the dress by the way very boho chic or whatever i was on my way home and i wanted to find out if you had a good time at the toga party and also make sure that our plans for zimbabwe were still on i see you tried to claw your own eye out; it's edgy"" 
 ""blue said ""i can't get in this car do you see what's happening behind me i don't even want to look"" 
 henry said ""how about you give me the finger and shout at me now and withdraw with your principles"" he smiled winningly and held up three fingers he counted to two with devil horns 
 ""this is incredibly unnecessary"" blue told him but she could feel herself smiling 
 ""life's a show"" he replied he counted one with his middle finger and then his face melted into exaggerated shock 
 blue shouted ""drop dead you bastard"" 
 ""fine"" henry screamed back with slightly more hysteria than the role required"" 
 he was such an intriguing character especially with the whole robobee situation 
 and then the book circles back to ronan and adam and i'm not freaking out or smiling or anything like that: 
 ""he wordlessly crossed the floor and sat beside adam on the mattress when he held out his hand adam put the model into it 
 ""this old thing"" ronan said he turned the front tyre and again the music played out of it they sat like that for a few minutes as ronan examined the car and turned each wheel to play a different tune adam watched how intently ronan studied the seams his eyelashes low over his light eyes ronan let out a breath put the model down on the bed beside him and kissed adam"" 
 he surprised me so much that my heart started beating too fast it was such a perfectly build up moment and i'm speechless and in love and in tears and and and time stopped for me this is giving me life right now this is giving me so much life 
 ""he was pretty sure he had just been ronan's first kiss"" 
 i reread that page so many times that i now remember every single word someone finally got kissed my favorite someone and it was such a genuine and real moment too good for words 
 i was speechless for so long but henry managed to perfectly describe how i was feeling: 
 ""his mother was the only one who knew what henry meant when he said that he wasn't good with words she was always trying to explain things to his father especially when she had decided to become seondeok instead of his wife it is that she for ever said but also something more "" 
 this is exactly how i feel when i try to explain my love for this series and the characters within 
 but then you know what's happening next the most painful moment that i dreaded and hoped hoped hoped wouldn't happen (but secretly wanted to see played out-- but also didn't) 
 ""tell me where owen glendower is"" he said to the darkness crisp and sure with the same power he had used to command noah to command the skeletons in the cave ""show me where the raven king is"" 
 ""wait you're going to junk up your nice coat white man take this"" he shouldered out of his aglionby sweater and proffered it 
 ""so you're literally giving me the shirt off your back"" gansey said swapping him for his coat he was grateful he looked up to henry ""see you on the other side excelsior"" 
 i started crying here because no henry no 
 but then gansey and the group find glendower and go in only to find it to be not as they imagined: 
 ""the only thing was that gansey had always feared that he would find glendower just a little too late minutes days months after death but this man had been dead for centuries the helmet and skull were only metal and bone"" 
 ""gansey touched the skull the raised cheekbone the face of his promised and ruined king everything was dry and gray 
 it was over 
 this man was not going to ever be anything to gansey 
 ""gansey"" blue asked 
 every minute was giving way to another and then another and slowly it sank into his heart all the way to the centre: 
 it was over"" 
 but it wasn't really 
 ""one of the great things about blue sargent was that she never really gave up hope he would have told her this but he knew it would only upset her more he said ""i can't watch ronan die blue and adam - and matthew - and all this we don't have anything else you already saw my spirit you already know what we chose"" 
 blue closed her eyes and two tears ran out of them she did not cry noisily or in a way that asked him to say anything different she was a hopeful creature but she was also a sensible creature"" 
 i was hopeful till the last page 
 ""there was no time 
 ""thanks for everything henry"" gansey said ""you're a prince among men"" 
 henry's face was blank 
 blue said ""i hate this"" 
 it was right though gansey felt the feeling of time slipping - one last time the sense of having done this before he gently laid the backs of his hands on her cheeks he whispered ""it'll be ok i'm ready blue kiss me"" 
 the power to stay quiet in the middle of the night while crying was nearly impossible especially when listening to sad music 
 ""he pulled back from her 
 out loud with intention with the voice that left no room for doubt he said ""let it be to kill the demon"" 
 right after he spoke blue threw her arms tightly around his neck right after he spoke she pressed her face into the side of his right after he spoke she held him like a shouted word love love love 
 he fell quietly from her arms 
 he was a king"" 
 maggie really knew how to destroy me i needed him back 
 ""ronan crouched beside him black still smeared on his face under his nose and around his ears his dreamt firefly rested on gansey's heart ""wake up you bastard"" he said ""you fucker i can't believe that you would "" 
 and he began to cry"" 
 ""i just don't understand"" henry said ""i was so sure that this was going to  change everything i didn't think it would end like this"" 
 ""i always knew it was going to end like this"" she said ""but it still doesn't feel right would this ever feel right"" 
 would it 
 ""the minute hand quivered it quivered again 
 blue was already tired of a timeline without gansey in it 
 adam looked up from where he was folded in the grass his voice was small ""what about cabeswater"" 
 ""what about it"" ronan asked ""it's not powerful enough to do anything any more"" 
 ""i know"" adam replied ""but if you asked - it might die for him"" 
 i seriously cannot remember a time when i've felt so deeply for a character's (near) death 
 ""the last tree fell and the forest was gone and everything was absolutely silent 
 blue touched gansey's face she whispered ""wake up"" 
 i truly applaud stiefvater for everything she managed to conclude in this book she really brought him back and ronan and adam and blue and everyone and just thank you 
 ""he closed his eyes and he began to dream"" 
 this review and more can be found on my blog right after i finished this book i had a bit of an accident i was running with a pair of lightsabers when i tripped and fell and accidentally sliced the entire book to shreds maybe it's not a good idea to run with lightsabers 
 city of fallen angels is amazing - oh wait that was weird my keyboard cut me off this is some sort of conspiracy isn't it like the way that certain unnamed sites sometimes don't like to publish non-glowing reviews i never write those *angelic smile* oh did that angelic smile make me look like jace he's such a pretty shiny angel *sigh* 
 as i was saying this book is amazingly unnecessary i'm sorry fangirls please don't eat me 
 here is a general rundown no specific twists are revealed just vaguely referenced so possible spoilers: 
 part one 
 ch 1-2: simon talks to people jace and clary talk to each other and kiss 
 ch 3-5: simon talks to new guy jace and clary talk to each other 
 ch 6-8: clary talks to people simon and jace talk about clary 
 ch 9: jace clary and simon all make outoops i mean jace and clary make out simon bites ummmm talks to girls and has relationship issues 
 part two 
 ch 10-11: new guy is revealed dun dun dun blah blah an attack wonder woman saves the day (wow something actually happened for two seconds) vampire chat 
 ch 12-13: people talk about the vampire chat jace and clary do stuff 
 ch 14-15: jace has issues chatty chatty chatty 
 ch 16-17: jace goes emo weird stuff is revealed 
 ch 18-19: clary believes in jace things happen 
 ch 20: chatting again lovey dovey stuff but wait - someone is alive (luke skywalker scream - everyone join in with their best squeaky voice) nooooooooooo 
 i have never given out a one star rating before never so trust me i don't take this lightly at all and i don't enjoy being negative making light of a bad situation is just something i try to do however i don't like disliking things and i never try to be flat out hateful about anything to love everything would be great but that's just not realistic 
 don't just write me off as a hater and leave it at that i actually really liked the original series 
 let me explain - while knowing nothing of clare's plagiarism or the controversy surrounding the books the need for something similar to buffy overwhelmed me leading to the discovery of the urban fantasy genre my first experience with this genre was the mortal instruments which had just released the third book out of pure desperation the fact that it was a derivative was not even almost a deterrent clare told a fast-paced and action filled ya suspense which was exactly what i needed at the time 
 the first three mortal instruments had this addictive quality that made you need to read more which led me to read this one so while i still hold true to my original feelings of the first books and have a sick yet fond place in my heart for them i truly feel that this particular series should have ended where city of glass left us 
 it saddens me to think that i may have contributed to the mass production of unnecessary sequels or to clare's dragon horde of gold oh well she's rolling in it already what exactly she deserves to be rolling in i'll leave up to interpretation this is a joke no speculation is actually necessary she's rolling in money okay are you happy you better be 
 regardless of how much she has made it is respectable for anyone to make bookoos of cash doing what they love as long as they aren't hurting or taking advantage of anyone there's no problem with it although sometimes large companies can take advantage of small time authors or even gullible readers so it's a good thing that i got this from my library and didn't pay any of my own money (however my library surely made a contribution) 
 it's too bad lesser-known books and their authors don't get the opportunities and the recognition that some of these more mainstream novels do but that isn't how the industry works right now hype sells controversy sells 
 fellow girl-power groupies: don't kill me i liked jace in the original books but i soon realized how destructive this small adoration can become 
 now fangirl mobbing is truly my greatest fear so i don't want to piss anyone off but jace is prick a hot one yes and i readily admit to secret desires of being pursued by a ""bad boy"" but seriously calm yourselves he's fictional 
 by the way that girls talk about him you would think that his saliva is made of awesomesauce 
 or that his face is made of the ark of the covenant don't look directly at him your skin might melt off 
 i wanted to like this and wanted my jace crush to transfer over to this book i swear i did and maybe i was prepared to not like it because of a few certain friend reviews *cough* jillianhellionmajavinaya *cough* but i tried really enjoying this just wasn't in my power 
 objectivity is something we should all strive for with every read even after hearing bad things about a specific book one can still have an open mind when reviewing we aren't trying to prove anyone right or wrong we are just giving our own impressions about the book 
 sometimes when an avid reader reads a mega-hyped book such as this we can take on a similar persona to that of bill and ted they are all about the excellent adventure first and foremost with ya fantasy - we mostly want to be entertained all the better if we learn something or absorb a good message while doing it but the entertainment part is essential 
 why i didn't like this book 
 not funny at the time i thought there was quite a bit of good humor in the originals this one: nada or maybe i've just outgrown it the corners of my mouth never even lifted in fact a scowl probably made an appearance or twoor twenty this book is to ""funny"" what vampires are to ""real"" (hint: they aren't) 
 not entertaining every few pages i felt the need to go for a spin in my car with my head hanging out the window just to stay awake the suspense the tension the action - everything i liked about the originals was gone i'd say this book is about 1% action 99% chatting i may have entertained myself about this book but this book did not entertain me not for one second 
 not new this was a rehash of every conversation jace and clary and simon had in the first books that took up an entire book clary i love you but i can't because i think i'm evil jace you're so emo simon you're my best friend this is a repeat a rerun and not even a funny rerun it's like that sucky episode of friends with alec baldwin in it that no one cares to remember 
 not inspiring unlike most of my favorite books there wasn't anything to take away from this book if we are not going to be entertained then shouldn't we at least learn something or feel like we derived some deeper meaning from the book 
 both ender's game and the hunger games had serious messages about war the giver teaches us that human emotion is essential to our lives what did city of fallen angels teach us serious spoiler ahead dont click unless you really want to know that it is okay to be a prick because you've been possessed by a demon maybe there was some deeper message and i just didn't see it because i was so bored if so i apologize for my oversight 
 let's end on a high note shall we so i'll leave you with this: 
 even if i don't particularly like a book i can usually find something good about having spent my time on it this one was much more difficult to find that ""good part"" but i still managed to 
 so despite not laughing once as a result of a joke in the book i found myself alone laughing hysterically in my room about how horribly pointless this book was or about random crap that i find funny usually involving jace and clary somehow i managed to amuse myself 
 seriously dumb stuff dances through my head like a frisky stallion does through a meadow full of unicorns i wonder if jace is part unicorn because unicorns are made of awesomesauce and rainbows i bet jace is made of rainbows or at least clary seems to think so - just wait until she figures out that he has no pots of gold 
 and before i go find something awesome to read i have something to ask you: 
 question: quick both jace and clary are drowning you can only save one what should you do 
 answer: let them both drown and read a different book this was funny and weird and fascinating and i had such a good time reading it i just loved seeing how everything unfolded from this different perspective it made twilight fresh and exciting again and i really enjoyed it before i start my review can we just take a minute to admire this beautiful piece of art featuring my favorites: 
 source 
 ""i will have you without armour kaz brekker or i will not have you at all"" 
 this review contains *spoilers* 
 the wait for this grandiose sequel has been all-consuming i've been thinking about the dregs for months and months now so getting back into their lives has been one of the most rewarding experiences 
 the book opens on wylan still wearing kuwei yul-bo's features since nina didn't trust herself with her powers now it had been just under a week since the dregs reached ketterdam almost a month since they'd left djerholm and they're all fighting to get inej back before van eck could have his way with her 
 they were almost out of time but none of them knew the real game kaz ""dirtyhands"" brekker - the smooth smart criminal mastermind - was running 
 and so piece by piece the plan to rescue inej had come together 
 things were about to get dangerous 
 ""why do you guys say that anyway no mourners no funerals why not just say good luck or be safe"" 
 ""we like to keep our expectations low"" 
 literally one of my most pressing questions for the sequel was answered so quickly 
 but the days until van eck's deadline were dwindling and to get inej back they would need surprise on their side only one shot at getting the wraith out of this situation 
 but before all that can happen we get to read from the pov of my favorite warrior: inej ghafa legend of the barrel and let me tell you she is one of the most strong and determined and courageous characters i've known so watching her doubt herself and her saints damn near broke me what she had to go through in her first chapter left me both shaking and trembling ghafa has my soul heart and my enter being wrapped around her pinky 
 ""when fear arrives something is about to happen"" 
 meanwhile the dregs have gathered enough intel to get their girl the hell out of van eck's hole i felt truly terrified for inej because that brute managed to get into her head but she was done being frightened of this man and so was i--thanks to both her and the man of the hour my favorite bastard of the barrel: kaz brekker with that demonic cane 
 you know i forgot for a second there just how dark he can be when it comes down to business but he's called dirtyhands for a reason and we're reminded just exactly what he had done to earn his reputation 
 ""sometimes the only way to get justice is to take it for yourself"" 
 i'm still furious at myself for believing that that smug merch son of a bitch could outthink kaz brekker and with the help of his loyal dregs they manage to get inej of out harm's way but not without trouble coming their way the kind of trouble even jan van eck hadn't foreseen: shu with wings () looking to hunt and capture grisha 
 but the deal is the deal and van eck has to pay up--dirtyhands is not someone to piss off they'd set out to get inej back from van eck and they had but they're not done with the merch and the plan the dregs have set is so intricate that it will be the end of the van eck empire without a shadow of a doubt 
 okay so here's the official plan to both earning their thirty million kruge and obliterating the devil himself: they're going after van eck's sugar crop since he controls the silos where the supply is produced: 
 * thanks to wylan's weevil they can destroy the sugar in van eck's silos without being exposed 
 * ""my father can weather a loss the other merchants the ones who own the sugar in his silos will be hit worse"" 
 * and once the other merchants learn that van eck has been buying up sugar that isn't stored in his silos (thanks to kaz purchasing shares on behalf of van eck) his reputation will be annihilated 
 ""van eck's reputation will take a hit when the sugar is lost but when the people who paid him to keep it safe find out he profited from their loss they'll look more closely at those silos"" 
 ""and find the remnants of the weevil"" finished wylan 
 ""destruction of property tampering with the markets"" inej murmured ""it will be the end of him"" 
 * they'll get the weevil into the silos by letting tiny and ferocious inej do what she's best at: climbing up twenty stories high and walking a high wire from one silo to the nextno biggie 
 * and while doing all of the above they're also going to get the rest of the grisha out of the city at nina's request 
 a ship to ravka with twenty passengers (including kuwei) is conspicuous so they're going to steal van eck's own transport to remain obscure they couldn't just be smarter than their opponent they had to be relentless 
 * i just why is everything so damn complicated with the dregs they're nothing if not ambitious 
 ""you couldn't go to war with an upstanding merch like van eck not if you were a thug with a reputation dirtier than a stable hand's boot sole to win kaz would have to level the field he would show the world what he already knew: despite his soft hands and fine suits van eck was a criminal just as bad as any barrel thug--worse because his word was worth nothing"" 
 it's a known fact that kaz brekker is a smooth smart criminal mastermind but he also hurts for his big criminally inclined family and watching him realize just that was one of my most cherished scenes 
 ""he was going to break my legs "" she said her chin held high the barest quaver in her voice ""would you have come for me then kaz when i couldn't scale a wall or walk a tightrope when i wasn't the wraith anymore"" 
 dirtyhands would not the boy who could get them through this get their money keep them alive would do her the courtesy of putting her out of her misery then cut his losses and move on 
 ""i would come for you"" he said and when he saw the wary look she shot him he said it again ""i would come for you and if i couldn't walk i'd crawl to you and no matter how broken we were we'd fight our way out together--knives drawn pistols blazing because that's what we do we never stop fighting"" 
 i cant stop thinking about this without getting goosebumps damn you kaz 
 you know speaking of which wylan finding out that his mother was still alive and in an insane asylum because of rotten van eck made me want to string his father up in a barren field and let the vultures have at him to quote jesper 
 but seriously that whole situation made my heart race i couldn't believe to what levels of evil van eck would sink the only silver lining was the whole plan kaz had in store for the devil and hopefully seeing wylan reunite with marya hendriks i'm always weak for stories reuniting mother and son always 
 also jesper trying to cheer wylan up made me shed a tear or two 
 ""hey"" jesper said giving him a shake ""hey your father could have made a lot of choices when he found out you couldn't read hell he could have said you were blind or that you had trouble with your vision or better yet he could have just been happy about the fact that he had a genius for a son"" 
 ""i'm not a genius"" 
 ""you're stupid about a lot of things wylan but you are not stupid and if i ever hear you call yourself a moron again i'm going to tell matthias you tried to kiss nina with tongue"" 
 wylan wiped his nose on his sleeve ""he'll never believe it"" 
 ""then i'll tell nina you tried to kiss matthias with tongue"" 
 they seriously deserve the world and so much more they all did 
 this was them at their best 
 and then halfway through the book the plan suddenly changes because ketterdam has turned on kaz ""but if you couldn't open a door you just had to make a new one"" and that's what dirtyhands excels at 
 ""i know how to do it"" kaz said slowly ""how to get kuwei out get the grisha out get our money beat van eck and give that son of a bitch pekka rollins everything he has coming to him"" 
 nina raised a brow ""is that all"" 
 ""how"" asked inej 
 ""this whole time we've been playing van eck's game we've been hiding we're done with that we're going to stage a little auction right out in the open"" he turned to face them and his eyes gleamed flat and black as a shark's ""and since kuwei is so eager to sacrifice himself he's going to be the prize"" 
 my heart leapt like a horse clearing a jump kuwei is going to auction himself with the hopes that the ravkans will end up buying him it was the best chance they had of getting kuwei to ravka and saving grisha lives to quote brekker it was a mad spiky monster of a plan and that was what it had to be for them to succeed 
 seriously though how does bardugo keep up with herself there were so many twists and turns that left my mind spinning even after having closed my eyes the whole storyline is just so lancing--we know where the end-game is supposed to be but to get there the dregs would have to go through hell and back and damn that they did 
 but before hell comes their way kaz and inej share an intimate moment that left me undone he had gone to great lengths to prove he was capable of anything 
 ""the sickness was there the need to run the need for something else too kaz thought he knew the language of pain intimately but this ache was new it hurt to stand here like this so close to the circle of her arms it isn't easy for me either after all she'd endured he was the weak one but she would never know what it was like for him to see nina pull her close watch jesper loop his arm through hers what it was to stand in doorways and against walls and know he could never draw nearer"" 
 i'll be 100% honest this choked me up a little bit 
 ""before he even knew what he intended he lowered his head she drew in a sharp breath his lips hovered just above the warm juncture between her shoulder and the column of her neck he waited tell me to stop push me away 
 she exhaled ""go on"" she repeated finish the story"" 
 my heart should not be making that sound 
 ""the barest movement and his lips brushed her skin--warm smooth beaded with moisture desire coursed through him a thousand images he'd hoarded barely let himself imagine--the fall of her dark hair freed from its braid his hand fitted to the lithe curve of her waist her lips parted whispering his name 
 all of it there and then gone "" 
 this is heaven what i truly want i have no words to thank you for this 
 seriously leigh can write evocative raw and hauntingly powerful scenes like nobody's business 
 ""two of the deadliest people the barrel had to offer and they could barely touch each other without both of them keeling over but they'd tried he'd tried maybe they could try again"" 
 they truly deserve their happy ending 
 but in the end it all came down to this: ""brekker his wraith queen his rotten little court of thugs"" because no matter what would happen the dregs had a way of rewriting their own rules 
 i mean that ending that ending was every bit as epic as i had anticipated it either would've gone brilliantly or in total disaster but that's generally the way this crew likes to work 
 also one last minor thing: i was on the edge the whole time to see who would survive even though the table of contents kind of gave away who lives who dies who tells their story but i cannot for the life in me believe matthias helvar got killed off by a young druskelle this is not what i want this is not what i planned 
 ""after all their mad escapes and close calls he'd started to believe the six of them were somehow charmed that his guns kaz's brains nina's wit inej's talent wylan's ingenuity and matthias' strength had made them somehow untouchable they might suffer they might take their knocks but wylan was right in the end they were all supposed to stay standing 
 ""no mourners"" said jesper surprised by the ache of tears in his throat 
 ""no funerals"" they all replied softly"" 
 my eyes burned tears streaming down my cheeks i was whispering ""come back to me"" right there with nina 
 i just i was rooting for everyone to have their happy ending everyone so this death came as such a shocking reveal i felt sorrow dragging at my heart for hours after that and i'm still not over it 
 this saintsforsaken book has taken away a piece of my heart with that ending i've got this ache in my chest that won't go away i want to be free but i know i won't be forgetting the dregs anytime soon

 this review and more can be found on my blog so freakin good this just became one of my favorite books of the year and one of my favorite contemporary novels of all time it was funny and romantic and touching and so beautifully written i loved it i literally just finished it and i already want to reread it highly recommended the heat of the incinerator wrapped around inej like a living thing a desert dragon in his den hiding from the ice waiting for her she knew her body's limits and she knew she had no more to give she'd made a bad wager it was as simple as that the autumn leaf might cling to its branch but it was already dead the only question was when it would fall 
 let go inej her father had taught her to climb to trust the rope the swing and finally to trust in her own skill to believe that if she leaped she would reach the other side would he be waiting for her there let go inej should she jump now or simply wait for her body to give out 
 my mind is spinning i tend to prefer simplicity in books i hate a ridiculously complicated plot i hate unnecessary characters for the young adult genre this book can best be described as epic because it is huge it is complicated it's like 
 ocean's eleven 
 for the ya fantasy crowd in the very best of ways 
 there are 6 main characters typically that's 4 more than i'd like the book's downfall is also what makes it great and it's why i docked a star it's epic perhaps too epic too complicated books tend to confuse me and let's face it a large cast with different povs tend to make it extremely confusing for the reader - and it is to an extent true in this book it is nonstop action with nary a moment to breathe there is a cast of characters in the beginning and by god you'll need it sometimes i felt like i was memorizing things for a test 
 but the good is that the characters are all bad-ass the packleader is an anti-hero which in my opinion is the best kind of character 
 kaz narrowed his eyes ""i'm not some character out of a children's story who plays harmless pranks and steals from the rich to give to the poor"" 
 i like them dirty and the book moves at a breakneck speed that'll guarantee the reader's interest 
 there's magic - naturally but a different kind of magic than such was found in the grisha the characters are well-written they're a ragtag band of misfits and not exactly friends but all are united for a common mission and most importantly they each have a purpose there are no redundant extraneous characters but each character is doing this for their own reason 
 four million kruge freedom a chance to return home she'd said she wanted these things but in her heart she couldn't bear the thought of returning to her parents could she tell her mother and father the truth would they understand all she'd done to survive not just at the menagerie but every day since could she lay her head in her mother's lap and be forgiven what would they see when they looked at her 
 the female characters are kick-ass they're feminine but not useless they don't try too hard to be rebels to be bad-ass to deny their own nature to prove they can play with the boys they're just themselvesthat's confusing i know but i can't describe it any other way 
 there is romance but so little of it and what little there is felt natural and unobtrusive a blossoming from grudging tolerance to like to possibly something more but i consider this a great book because the romance is not intrusive in any way 
 every time she moved the reindeer cloak parted revealing a flash of round calf white skin the shadow between her breasts it was deliberate he knew it she was trying to rattle him he needed to focus on the fire he'd almost died and if he didn't get a fire started he still might 
 nina snorted and lay down in the nest of pelts propping herself on one elbow ""for saint's sake druskelle what's wrong with you i just wanted to be warm i promise not to ravish you in your sleep"" 
 ""i'm not afraid of you"" he said irritably 
 her grin was vicious ""then you're as stupid as you look"" 
 he stayed crouching beside the fire he knew he was meant to lie down next to her the sun had set and the temperature was dropping he was struggling to keep his teeth from chattering and they would need each other's warmth to get through the night it shouldn't have concerned him but he didn't want to be near her because she's a killer he told himself that's why she's a killer and a witch 
 halle-freaking-lujah survival + rationality > romance *wipes away tear* i never thought i'd see the day he's the hottest korean i've ever seen 
 not that i have much experience with koreans but all the ones i've encountered couldn't even be considered in the same realm as sophie's brother 
 this is not a book for k-pop lovers it is a book about a superior condescending american and how she spreads her knowledge to the poor ignorant k-pop star 
 ""she doesn't play any instrument"" yoon jae provides ""she just knows everything about music"" 
 ""that's not true"" i say but i can't help smiling at his blind confidence in me ""i only know a few things"" 
 ""would you be interested in helping me with a new song"" jason asks 
 this book is the k-pop equivalent of the last samurai let me explain the last samurai is widely held as the movie that displays a prime example of western superiority long story short: white guy goes into japan without knowing anything the language the culture the combat styles out-samurais all the japanese dudes wins the heart of the fairest japanese woman in the village 
 this book can pretty much be described in the same manner white girl goes into south korea not knowing the language the customs improves the k-pop industry wins the heart of the hottest k-pop idol in the land 
 bullshit absolutely bullshit this book displays the stereotype of the ugly american at its worst the main character is condescending views everything foreign as ""exotic"" is completely unwilling to learn and appreciate the culture and steadfastly clings onto her own standards without embracing the new american tourists have a pretty bad reputation abroad and the main character in this book displays no deviation from that stereotype 
 this book mocks korean culture from the way the people smells to the heavy accent to the squat toilets to the language to the formalities within the culture 
 ""why are there so many different levels of formality"" i ask jason praying he's feeling gracious ""i don't get it"" 
 ""it has to do with respect"" he says shocking me ""you want to give respect to people who have authority over you or are older"" 
 ""okay i get that but seven levels really"" 
 he doesn't answer 
 ""it's dumb"" pops out of my mouth before i can stop it and i mentally kick myself just what i need--to insult the language of the country i just moved to 
 if you are expecting a lot of k-pop loving as i did be prepared for severe disappointment 
 i don't have the nerve to tell him his music is heartless mass-produced fluff 
 the main character's superior attitude towards k-pop and korean music makes me want to gag 
 ""but you think i should make it more like your american music"" he asks 
 ""you say that like it's a bad thing"" 
 this book made me rage i wouldn't recommend it for k-pop fans i wouldn't recommend it for any kind of light summery read it just gave me a headache 
 as a side note: it's kind of stupid to rant about a book involving k-pop so allow me to give myself some credibility i've been a k-pop fan for a long-ass time since before some of your oppas were even born i started with shinhwa (and suffered their departure) i loved dbsk (and i witnessed with much heartbreak their departure) i fell in love with exo (and was absolutely heartbroken at the demise of exo-moh luhan;_;) 
 there may be a trend here 
 in any case i know my freaking k-pop i've bopped to hot's candy and i danced along to bonamana i attempted to do growl but only ended up looking like a freakishly incompetent cowboy i'm well-read on korean culture i'm well up-to-date on k-pop current releases and i consider myself if not an expert very very well-informed on the k-pop scene just keep me out of your flame wars i ain't an elf i ain't a cassie i ain't a baby leave me out of your drama i'm here for the music 
 since i'm accusing the main character of elements of racism let me first be fair let's address the huge fucking pink elephant in the room korean culture and k-pop is not innocent when it comes to racism i am not speaking for all koreans by any means and i understand that every culture is guilty of feeling racially superior to some extent but the k-pop world is peppered with racism particularly when it comes to darker-skinned races and people 
 this denigration of darker-skinned people is not limited to foreigners even koreans who are darker-skinned get mocked (like the beautiful golden-skinned kai of exo who has been constantly given a hard time for his darker skin tone) snsd members have mocked a member whose skin is darker calling her dirty-looking there are rampant examples in which k-pop idols have dressed up in blackface (and nobody thinks anything of it) and there are numerous examples in which idols have made highly racist statements without any serious repercussion from society whatsoever 
 so there you have it racism does exist in south korea but that's not to say we should emulate it we should strive to be better an eye for an eye is not the answer here you cannot solve racism by being racist in return 
 look i'm not fucking mother theresa i'm a jerk so it should say something when i feel like we should maybe try to get along 
 open k-pop discussion in the comments go 
 quotes were taken from an uncorrected proof subject to change in the final edition 15 stars 
 edit: changed the rating because it's gotten to the point where my sister and i have inside jokes on how stupid and shallow this book is i can't think about this book without getting angry 
 i have a history with pretentious people 
 my biggest mess involved two boys in particular who were so incredibly full of themselves that for the first time in my life i openly expressed my dislike to them they know that i couldn't care less about their ""hotness"" or just how amazing they were so goddamn full of themselves spoiled rotten just overall horrible people 
 in short my personality clashes with theirs entirely and there really is no chance of a friendship i'd dive into it but then this wouldn't be a book review 
 and so i move on 
 the fault in our stars is my first john green book 
 yeah i know but i didn't really get into reading up until maybe four years ago and i'm not too into contemporary but the opportunity presented itself and i took my first dive my sister is a fan of john green she really loves looking for alaska and will grayson will grayson and finds paper towns to be lfa's quirky new girl twin that doesn't own up 
 i almost feel bad for disliking this book but that's strictly on the idea of cancer cancer is horrible unpredictable and the worst part is that it's your own cells mutating against you that's why it's so hard to defeat that's what i wish this book was about: dealing with the cancer that wants to kill you instead i get a book about a fictional miracle drug that keeps hazel alive so she can have a boy love her then die (not even on sight either)  
 i came into this book with an open mind i assure you but i ended up really wanting to put the book down several times from the first few pages i felt something was actually wrong like i didn't know what i was getting myself into having finished this book which to me was such a chore to do i think i've stumbled upon decent reasons as to why i really can't give this any more than two stars 
 if you didn't know by now the fault in our stars tells the story of hazel a girl whose thyroid cancer has ceased to grow thanks to a magical miracle drug but because her cancer life is just so boring a boy has to make it better 
 because that is the only way anything gets better in life 
 boyz 
 cancer people dear readers 
 writing 
 this was by far the largest problem i had larger than hazel saying ""i wanna tap that"" about augustus on page 8 this prose was not the voice of a real teenager it tried but this did not sound like a teenager suffering from cancer this was the voice of a teenager who liked to say ""you know what sucks cancer you know what else sucks dying"" why so the reader could laugh 
 and wouldn't you know it every line is like that there is no rest for any real emotion or interest it's all laced with some one-liner or trying to be hilariously philosophical when it's just trying way too hard to keep a reader interested and this alone made me find great distaste in the character of hazel 
 she is not believable because i never learned anything about her she just hates support group and adores augustus for reasons that were never clarified throughout the book oh you like gus's smile his laugh the idea that he thinks of basketball really as a nod to a baby toy the idea that he spends money just so he can conduct a metaphor that doesn't do anything but make him look like a pretentious asshole 
 oh who am i kidding this entire book was shallow and pretentious everyone thought they were so hilarious because did you know that eggs are restricted to a breakfast food those poor scrambled eggs no i don't give a flying fuck about scrambled eggs and their apparent oppression but think about it we only have eggs for breakfast because you choose to point it out as such 
 or get this how about the hurdles event in track you know what augustus says about hurdles he says this after that beautiful basketball connection to a child shoving cylinders into circle holes: 
 ""and i wondered if the hurdlers ever thought you know 'this would go faster if they just got rid of the hurdles'"" 
 this is one of the stupidest things i have ever read in a book 
 augustus waters actual athlete says something like this about a sport sports are a very healthy way to escape stress if anything augustus and his philosophical ass should be wondering what the hurdles represent to the hurdlers hurdles are a special event the hurdlers are probably doing a running event too they chose to run the hurdles for the challenge 
 but this falls on the level of those scrambled eggs hey if we talk about this and make it sound funny it'll be deep it'll really scratch the heads of the readers this just shows how silly and thoughtful augustus is don't you guys just want to get with him and his awesome cigarette metaphor that he spends money on for no fucking reason 
 guh you fucking stupid ignorant son of a bitch this was the line by the way that got me in that level of dislike for augustus that i got on with the asshole dudes that exist in my life and hazel just sort of accepts this like what the hell is everyone thinking in this book what universe are they in because this is not a real universe 
 i think now i'm tracking into character territory so here: 
 characters 
 hazel was the girl who referred to testicular cancer as ""cancer to the balls"" and then she sees augustus waters on page 8 of this book and goes 
 ""look let me just say it: he was hot a nonhot boy stares at you relentlessly and it is at best awkward and at worst a form of assault but a hot boywell"" 
 remember if you're not drop dead gorgeous men your nice glances are only awkward that's it you can never go farther and your delicious insight on life will never win the heart of a girl because you are just not sexy enough or augustinian for it hazel likes to do this she likes to put down other guys for her gus even though they still barely knew each other 
 i met kaitlyn and her (cute but frankly not augustinian) boyfriend for coffee one afternoon 
 look at that what what is that this was a nice guy and hazel's like ""well he's not a fucking greek god so no thank you"" but what about augustus hazel you went to his house to watch a movie that you decided was just a silly boy movie that you knew you wouldn't like because you were a girl movies don't work like that what are you even doing 
 you know what i just realized hazel is a lot like mary in the forest of hands and teeth she hates one thing and loves only one material thing hazel hates the cancer support group and loves an imperial affliction mary hates the unconsecrated but loves the ocean that's all they have to their name which is amazing to me that augustus finds something to love about hazel all it is is her john green wit 
 if you asked gus what else was there to hazel besides this one book thing and her wit i bet you a hundred dollars that he would respond as derek in swan princess did with ""what else is there"" 
 because that's all their love is they're not bonding over the fact they have cancer they bonded over an imperial affliction then experienced an intensified hey arnold episode about visiting the author who to no one's surprise i hope was a complete jackass then makes a 180 becausebecause who needs reasons 
 however the half star is devoted to mr peter van houten who was the only actual character in this book everyone else was flat and pretentious assholes when van houten did it there was history behind it and a reason he actually had an arc he did things despite my lack of care for augustus and hazel the way peter treated them was abhorring and the only way for me to fix that was to stab the man in the eye but he changed and revealed why he acted the way he did and there was sense made and he was a good character 
 structure 
 structure was fine 
 still flowed okay despite my need to be done with this 
 overall 
 i honestly thought everything was funny i laugh at a loooooot of stuff this whatever this is is not really that funny it's shallow and not really geared to people who want to know the world of cancer and stepping over the obstacle it's a cancer-filled girl loving and losing a cancer-filled boy oh and they meet their favorite author who's actually an asshole cancer is the backseat and i almost find it insulting 
 i don't understand why people love this tell me all you want that augustus is a beautiful boy and hazel just wanted something different in her life but don't you dare tell me that this is deep this is not a deep book there's nothing that touches my heart except shallow wit and a poor man suffering from the cancerous death of his 8 year-old ray of sunshine 
 i could go on but i think this is enough if it isn't well that's your opinion this is mine you are just gonna have to deal 
 final remarks: 
 this book should have been about what happened to peter van houten 
 it'd be perfectly parallel to that hey arnold episode i mentioned but it'd be better than what i read 
 or this book should have been about hazel with the terminal cancer because her inner conflict with cancer would better clash with her ability to be with augustus and it would've fleshed her out a hell of a lot more than giving her a magical miracle drug they've done it again threw my emotions onto a roller coaster ride into space and through wormholes and just every which way 
 it was kind of exhausting reading this but in such a good way man oh man <3 
 *edit* 
 third time reading this i listened to the audiobook if you have the opportunity to experience it on audio (even both audio & physically read) i would recommend you do it with a cast of characters and sound effects the listening experience is epic 
 the story is also pretty epic too these books kill me

 i loved this a review will be up on my channel on friday the short 
 trigger warnings: anxiety ocd 
 writing: 5 stars 
 characters: 475 stars 
 plot: 45 stars 
 originality: 4 stars 
 (all out of 5 stars) 
 the long 
 it's hard to believe i just read a new john green (jg from now on) book my mind can't really wrap around that (especially given where i was 5 years ago not even knowing booktube existed now i can't imagine my life without booktube and being hailey in bookland) but it was a pleasure to read his writing again he is extremely talented i was super nervous going into this admittedly after the smash success of tfios i couldn't imagine a more high pressure situation especially as i haven't absolutely loved all of his novels i just didn't know where this one would fall for me but i'm so happy that i loved it it's definitely my favourite ya book on mental illness that i've ever read 
 what sets jg apart and makes him imo a pioneer in the ya genre is the fact that he writes knowledgable teenage characters he doesn't discount teenagers as unintelligent due to their developing brains he recognizes that teenagers irl are able to comprehend complex concepts (this may seem obvious but i read a book on writing books for young readers recently and it emphasizes the fact that you have to use the most simplistic language possible so young teenage minds can understand it bs teenagers are not dumb) 
 because of this his characters are so startlingly relatable i think aza is an especially relatable character for me with her struggles with anxiety the way jg describes her experiences with anxiety spoke to me so intensely specifically the metaphor of the spiral blew my mind in all honesty jg definitely has a talent for metaphors i never get sick of it he's always had a way of finding the perfect words to describe that which seems indescribable seeing him use this technique regarding mental illness was fascinating i think if you do or ever have suffered from mental illness you will vastly appreciate his narrative 
 i found this story to be very different than jg's other novels not in a bad way at all but the plot was much more subtle there are two plots happening simultaneously really one internally and one externally you think you're following the one and then it turns out the other is the central focus the way the two were interwoven was genius 
 i think this has been written in a way that will appeal to both the next generation of ya readers as well as the aging generation of ya readers typically jg's novels have the romance as a main focal point and they really are some of my favourite romances but here the romance takes a back seat the front seat is occupied by aza's own personal mental health journey it was such a nice change (that's not to say there is no romance it's there but it's just not the main topic) 
 overall this made me so happy that john green is returning to the world of ya it was the most authentic representation of mental illness i've ever read and i'm so glad i went in with an open mind you can tell he is writing about something he's extremely familiar with i can't wait to see what he comes out with next (i hope he has plans to write more) hidden oracle 
 so fun and hilarious 
 i heart apollo 
 (a haiku book review in honor of the god of poetry) really impressed with this one cute romance funny dialogue and the format/illustrations made this even more fun and unique i also thought this book did a fantastic job at balancing the lightheartedness with the more serious stuff personally i could've done with a bit more resolution at the end--it felt a little rushed and i would've liked to linger for a few more pages also there were some things that didn't quite add up when i stopped to think about them but i was able to suspend my disbelief and just go with it 
 overall i thought this was a fantastic debut novel funny and sad and romantic all at once definitely recommended especially if you like cute unique contemporary cassandra clare's extra jem & tessa story 
 after the bridge: the full story (jem/tessa)

 dying to know what people think of the ending i don't know whether to love it or hate it i mean it feels like a cheap ploy to keep both sides happy but i feel like i should just be happy with that the epilogue is a jessa shippers dream come true but even though it is technically a happy ending i was balling my eyes out through the entire book i mean jem was so sweet adorable loving selfless and perfect he didn't want anyone to get hurt over him and just loved with all his heart he is seriously like the most perfect character ever <3 omg i love you james carstairs i cried when he found out about will's feelings and said he would have broken off the engagement i cried when he said that he wanted tessa to grow to love will i cried when he said he wanted to see charlotte's baby i cried when he said silent brotherhood was his only choice then i really seriously balled my eyes out when jem said goodbye to tessa and will they had to live without him omg then i as so happy during the epilogue that i cried some more finally 130 years later he gets to have a happy life with tessa i wonder if we will get to see him and tessa together in the mortal instruments or the dark artifices i'm still kind of confused by the timelines of all this i believe mortal instruments is 2007 and the epilogue was 2008 so maybe a chance for dark artifices 
 so things that did piss me off really jem was dying and tessa didn't sleep with him but right after they thought jem died she slept with will because she thought he might die and then at least after that they took time but i thought it was because will was giving tessa time to grieve and himself time to grieve but really he was just scared that tessa wouldn't love him like she did jem well of course not because jem is so much better than you but whatever will died and now tessa is with jem over all her lifetime with will and 71 years after his death she still never stopped loving jem or wearing his necklace awwwwwwww

 clockwork princess snippets 
 tessa reached to brush the damp hair from his forehead he leaned into her touch his eyes closing ""jem--have you ever--"" she hesitated ""have you ever thought of ways to prolong your life that are not a cure for the drug"" 
 at that his eyelids flew open ""what do you mean"" 
 she thought of will on the floor of the attic choking on holy water ""becoming a vampire you would live forever--"" 
 he scrambled upright against the pillows of the bed ""tessa no don't--you can't think that way"" 
 ""is the thought of becoming a downworlder truly so horrible to you"" 
 ""tessa "" he exhaled slowly ""i am a shadowhunter nephilim like my parents before me it is the heritage i claim just as i claim my mother's heritage as part of myself it does not mean i hate my father but i honor the gift they gave me the blood of the angel the trust placed in me the vows i have taken nor i think would i make a very good vampire [redacted for spoilers] i would no longer be will's parabatai no longer be welcome in the institute no tessa i would rather die and be reborn and see the sun again than live to the end of the world without daylight"" 
 ""a silent brother then"" she said 
 his eyes softened slightly ""the path of silent brotherhood is not open to me""

 will's eyes met tessa's as she came closer almost tripping again over the torn hem of her gown for a moment they were in perfect understanding jem was what they could still look each other straight in the eye about on the topic of jem they were both fierce and unyielding tessa saw will's hand tighten on jem's sleeve ""she's here"" he said 
 jem's eyes opened slowly tessa fought to keep the look of shock from her face his pupils were blown out his irises a thin ring of silver around the black ""ni shou shang le ma qin ai de"" he whispered ""are you hurt my love"" 
 omg what happened to jem cries 
 ----- 
 ""wo wei ni xie de"" he said as he raised the violin to his left shoulder tucking it under his chin he had told her many violinists used a shoulder rest but he did not: there was a slight mark on the side of his throat like a permanent bruise where the violin rested 
 ""you -- made something for me"" tessa asked 
 ""i wrote something for you"" he corrected with a smile and began to play 
 ----- 
 ""though will was saying earlier"" tessa added ""that heroes all come to bad ends and he could not imagine why anyone would want to be one anyway"" 
 ""ah"" jem's hand squeezed hers briefly and then let it go ""well will is looking at it from the hero's viewpoint isn't he but as for the rest of us it's an easy answer"" 
 ""is it"" 
 ""of course"" his voice was almost a whisper now ""heroes endure because we need them not for their own sakes if will "" 
 ----- 
 ""you do not want to help us"" will said to magnus ""you do not want to position yourself as an enemy of mortmain's"" 
 ""well can you blame him"" woolsey rose in a whirl of yellow silk ""what could you possibly have to offer that would make the risk worth it to him"" 
 ""i will give you anything"" said tessa in a low voice that will felt in his bones ""anything at all if you can help us help jem"" 
 magnus gripped a handful of his black hair ""god the two of you i can make inquiries track down some of the more unusual shipping routes old molly --"" 
 ""i've been to her"" will said ""something's frightened her so badly she won't even crawl out of her grave"" 
 woolsey snorted ""and that doesn't tell you anything little shadowhunter is it really worth all this just to stretch your friend's life out another few months another year he will die anyway and the sooner he dies the sooner you can have his fiancee the one you're in love with"" he cut his amused gaze toward tessa ""really you ought to be counting down the days till he expires with great eagerness"" 
 who is this woolsey douchebag and where is he so i can shove my foot up his ass

 dear charlie 
 i am writing to you because i feel like you're the only one that would listen to me right now from all the friends that i have made you are the one that's the most understanding i guess what i'm trying to do is thank you for being there for me these last couple of days i didn't expect to learn from you as much as i have my mom always says that you can never really understand a person until you walk in their shoes but i guess getting to know you and reading your story did just that i have to say you have stripped me from any prejudice i might have had and i am truly sorry if i had any you showed me that no matter what happens what we experience we always have a right to feel the way we feel just because you showed me the purity of feelings beauty of thoughts generosity of love and warmth of friendship you made me appreciate books and poetry more and see the impact they have on people's lives for that you will always hold a special place in my heart i'd like to think that you get better i hope one day you can be honest with people you love be who you really are and do what you want to do most importantly i hope that you will love the real sam and not just the idea of her and be ready for her to love you back i hope we can see each other some day i'll make sure to come back and remind myself of everything that is you tho i hope to never forget

 ladies - it's time to cut the cord on this and write some new shit le doy 5 estrellas porque yo soy el autor perdonen el egocentrismo 45/5 
 great book slowish start but really picked up in the middle and had an epic ending 45 stars reeeaaally close to being a 5 star book for me this was so awesome and engaging i had trouble putting it down to take breaks for food and sleep and this is so not a standalone i'm glad the sequel is officially happening because i need more 
 i thought both main characters were great i did prefer elias' chapters because they were more action packed though laia went through some excellent character development as for secondary characters/the romances i wasn't a huge fan of keenan but i loved helene i can't wait to see how this develops in future books because we are definitely getting another book yay 
 overall this was an awesome read probably the best debut novel i've read in a while and i'm really looking forward to discussing this in the liveshow wow halfway through this book i thought i had it all figured out i was very very wrong in a very very good way this book was touching and thoughtful and man oh man does it pack an emotional punch awesome debut definitely recommended and i'm looking forward to reading more by adam silvera in the future fantastic conclusion to this duology this series has such a great balance of adventure and romance and i just love all the history and the beautiful writing at times i did feel that the pacing was a little off there were some slow parts but overall i thoroughly enjoyed this duology and while this story was complete and i'm very satisfied with it i still want more a sequel a prequel a spin-off different characters whatever -- i just adore this world and this society of time travelers and i could totally go for more 
 if you want a duology that features time travel and romance and adventure with lovely writing a colorful cast of secondary characters and a satisfying conclusion -- check this one out obviously i'm biased    but this book changed my life ;-) before you enter the world of caraval you must remember that it's all a game    
 45 stars i'm very impressed with this book the most important thing you need to know is that although it's marketed as such it really isn't a competition per se i mean it's as much a competition as the night circus is 
 sure it's a game indeed a treacherous game that you can lose yourself in at any moment but it's not a competition i'm not going to elaborate because i'd have to reveal some things that will spoil some surprises so you'll just have to trust me on that 
 but it's good so good it plays with the reader so well it's not only scarlett who risks her life to win the game it's also us or so i felt i felt as i were a player myself sometimes characters are clueless and don't see what is in front of them while we readers scream our heads off trying to make them see this never happens in this book because whenever scarlett learns something we learn it too 
 the reader in me can't help but try to guess what has happened and who that character is and what the characters will face in the future etc i just can't help myself and so that's what i did but even though i kept trying to have things figured in my mind before the main character ever could i still ended up being delightfully surprised 
 what really shines in this book is the action every new chapter brings a new setting or mishap or character: the story progresses well sometimes scenes can be lethargic because of an exaggerated amount of description but that too never happens in caraval 
 what stole my heart was the magical fairytale-esque writing style and narration though it obviously is a young adult novel - no cross-genre going on - i didn't mind that it wasn't more sexy or ghastly 
 it's very worth reading if you're a fan of fantasy novels uncanny and treacherous stories and thrilling intelligent plots

 at first i was like: 
  but then i was like: 
  and then i was all like: 
 during that scene where they unwound his brains while he was awake i still have the major heebeejeebs 
 i will never eat cauliflower again 
 unwind will shock you i mean roll-you-up-in-a-carpet-and-bitch-slap-you kind of shock you 
 and you will love it 45 stars for those of you who donaeur(tm)t know i had the opportunity to moderate sarahaeur(tm)s raleigh event last night in addition to that i spent some time with her talking about her inspiration and the way she approached the disability representation i have a lot to share so bear with me here you can also view this post on my blog here 
 first of all iaeur(tm)ve seen a lot of unfair accusations thrown her way iaeur(tm)m not here to defend everything and everyoneaeur(tm)s experience will be different so please keep that in mind as you read this review also please remember that discussion is great but please keep it kind and civil 
 and also i want to give a big shout out to sarah and the team at bloomsbury for taking care of me and making me feel so welcome i canaeur(tm)t say enough positive things about my experience you guys are amazing 
 moving on 
 new culture with the southern continents 
 one of the highlights of my evening was getting to ask sarah about her inspiration for the southern continents her answer actually really surprised me and iaeur(tm)m excited to pass it along sarah mentioned she spent a long time reading and researching ghengis kahn and spent a long time in front of the audience describing how he ran his empire despite being seen as a aeur~villainousaeur(tm) figure in history his empire was founded on the acceptance of all religions she talked a lot about how he valued education and reading and such iaeur(tm)ve seen people throw the aeur~culture appropriation without researchaeur(tm) accusation at sarah but she credits ghengis kahn in the end of her book and it was really neat to hear about the time and effort she spent studying him 
 also chaol is the only white person in the whole book (unless iaeur(tm)m missing something) and the new cultures and characters were such a breath of fresh air a majority of the book is spent world building and the development of new characters that will play vital roles in the next installment i canaeur(tm)t speak to the accuracy of how these characters are represented but i really loved how strong and courageous they are i donaeur(tm)t want to go into too much detail but the southern continents are lead by the khagan and his royal family the new princes and princesses are all so cool and they easily became my favorite characters there are also ruk riders which i wonaeur(tm)t touch too much on but holy crap they are going to bring a whole new level of epic to the series 
 chaol + disability representation (spoilers in the last paragraph) 
 this is such a touchy subject and i was debating whether or not to share my feelings towards the matter but *breathes heavily* here we go as you can see by my photos i have some experience with being in a chair some days i am able to walk but more often than not i simply donaeur(tm)t have the strength to stand or iaeur(tm)m too dizzy or sick due to the disease iaeur(tm)m battling so my experience isnaeur(tm)t the same as others in the disabled community and iaeur(tm)m speaking for myself and my personal experiences here but i do know pain i know what it's like to be unable to move for days at a time to be brushed aside or seen as less of a person 
 i was nervous to see how this would be handled as you know from queen of shadows chaol lost the use of his legs he can't move them or even feel them heaeur(tm)s in a wheelchair yep you heard meaeur| a fantasy hero in a wheelchair 
 he begins the journey as very resentful and upset and it takes him a long time to come to terms with what has happened to him not only physically but emotionally a lot of people accuse his character of being aeur~ruinedaeur(tm) and trampled on i disagree his attitude and outlook are totally and completely (and painfully) relatable to me personally i hate having to rely on others i hate not being able to get up and take care of myself it's so difficult to not see myself as aeur~lessaeur(tm) of a person because iaeur(tm)m not always able to do simple things the first time i was in a wheelchair in public wellaeur| it came as a bit of a shock to me it's almost like being invisible or like you have some type of contagious disease people either give you sad looks or avoid looking at you altogether you're skipped in line tripped over and ignored in many cases (thereaeur(tm)s so much more i could add to this but iaeur(tm)m going to refrain for now) 
 iaeur(tm)m generally positive but on the hard days it really is difficult it's easy to fall into the aeur~iaeur(tm)m uselessaeur(tm) or aeur~i donaeur(tm)t understand why this happened to meaeur(tm) pit of despair as you read through chaolaeur(tm)s emotional path to healing keep in mind that these are feelings people battle every single day not to mention sarah goes in depth about the actual physical struggles of chaolaeur(tm)s movements (more on this below) 
 ""he knewaeur""chaol realized the guard knew just how it felt to have the chair touched moved without being asked"" 
 i had the chance to talk to sarah about this face to face i told her i finished and i thanked her for how she handled chaol guys she broke down in tears in front of me iaeur(tm)ve never seen this type of dedication from an author to a disabled character in a fantasy novel she shared how she spent months with sensitivity reader(s) and a little bit about her journey writing chaol this way and why she chose to end it the way she did i canaeur(tm)t even begin to describe to you all what it meant to see this in a book to read his journey and how raw and honest it was the accuracy and detail was astounding sarah went above and beyond watch my review video here: https://wwwyoutubecom/watchv=fa3rl 
 watch my interview with morgan matson here: https://wwwyoutubecom/watchv=yvqhe 
 morgan matson definitely did not disappoint with this book filled with books dogs ice cream scavenger hunts and a swoon-worthy new romantic interest clark the unexpected everything was an addictive read i love the message of this book learning how to live in the moment and all of the characters were strong and (some of them) easy to love also clark what a babe a nerdy beautiful babe 
 i definitely recommend this and all of morgan matson's other books especially during summer thirteen reasons why i hate this book 
 note 6/10/17: tape #11 has been updated 
 https://emmareadstoomuchwordpressco 
 alright i really thought i wasn't going to review this book but a status sharing certain anti-anti 13 reasons why sentiments (did that make sense) just came up onto my timeline and i to put it cordially fucking snapped 
 let me preface this by saying: if this book or television show helped you in any way this review is not for you we all have our coping mechanisms we all have our favorite books - i am absolutely not here to shit on anyone's fave if you liked this book that's good please don't read this i reserve the right not to be nice to you if you comment on this saying i'm being unfair 
 so there are two sides to this debate one side thinks this book and the son of satan television show it spawned is inspiring important other positive i-words the other side - the side of my brethren which is unsurprisingly to anyone who follows me on here staggeringly outnumbered - disagrees i'm going to try to outline for you why i feel that way 
 disclaimer: if this at any point seems like i'm telling you you're not allowed to be a fan of this shit i'm not but i passionately hate it so don't expect objectivity also this contains spoilers for both the book and the show of course 
 let's get started i'll organize this by my very own thirteen reasons 
 tape #1: the book and the show donaeur(tm)t bring attention to mental illness 
 thataeur(tm)s one of the biggest defenses iaeur(tm)ve seen of this story that yes itaeur(tm)s triggering and yes itaeur(tm)s intense and yes itaeur(tm)s hard to talk about but itaeur(tm)s important 
 hereaeur(tm)s the thing: hannah baker is not a mentally ill character this book gave me way too many feelings i'd go from laughing at a cute scene to crying at a sad scene in a matter of minutes it was like emotional whiplash (in a good way) 
 i flew through this book over the course of a day and when i wasn't reading i was thinking about when i could get back to reading the characters were all so real and flawed and they're in such a complicated situation my heart just ached for all of them i also particularly loved the dual timeline it was perfectly woven together in a way that fleshed out the complexities of this situation while really ramping up the tension i can already tell that this is a book that will stay with me for a long time 
 if you're looking for a story that fully embraces the messiness of love and loss in a heart-wrenching and realistic way--this is it read this edit on january 9th 2016: i haven't thought about this book since i read it in july and i really have no interest anymore in reading the rest of the series 
 ---------- 
 it definitely was a slow moving book but the plot really held my attention and i loved the use of the pictures sometimes i felt like he tried a little too hard to make the pictures perfectly fit into the story which made it a little awkward to read but they still made the reading experience more interesting the book really read like a movie and i can't wait to see how tim burton's interpretation is going to turn out well i like it -\_(tsu)_/- 
 edited to add: if you're in need of a serious recap of passenger before you read wayfarer check this out: https://static1squarespacecom/stati now that this book is written and edited and out in 2 months i guess it's time to finally mark it as read <3 loved it but it needed more percy just saying i just realized i hadn't rated this dur 
 oh wow loved this book angel books are hard to do and this one is the best and kaidan can i lick him heck i'll lick wendy okay maybe shouldn't have written that this is why i don't do reviews le sigh *edit* 
 full review here: https://wwwyoutubecom/watchv=dxqbq 
 i don't even know what to say i'm sure the words will come and at that point i'll try to film a review but for now i'll just think about a million and one things 
 my gosh <3 
 review copy provided by publisher in exchange for an honest review this was such a heartbreakingly honest account of what is happening in america right now as a white reader the experience this story affords its readers cannot be taken for granted inspired by the black lives matter movement this book takes you into the heart of garden heights after the main character has witnessed the wrongful murder of her best friend khalil by a police officers being canadian as well as being white i have the privilege of not having to deal with any of the things starr deals with on a day to day basis but the experience of being alongside her as she grappled with the injustice of it all gave me a completely new understanding of what is going on in america i obviously am not ignorant to it all but this just felt like an honest firsthand account it really is indescribable this is such an important read and i highly encourage you to pick it up 
 i will do a full spoiler free review and spoiler discussion on my channel very soon a book lover always wants to read one of their favorite books for the first time againoblivion is a way to do that with obsidian <3 i really enjoyed this it was shorter than i expected and didn't have as strong a story arc as the other books of the lunar chronicles but it was fascinating getting to know levana's backstory seeing things from her pov got me to sympathize with her but it also made me realize just how twisted she is she's definitely not a likable character but i do understand her better now i also better understand the dynamics between levana and cinder and winter which was great 
 i think the best reading order would be publication order (cinder scarlet cress fairest winter) just because fairest has some minor spoilers for the previous books and while you could probably skip fairest and still be able to thoroughly enjoy the lunar chronicles it was still a very interesting and captivating read (i flew through it in one sitting) 
 bottom line: definitely recommended if you like the lunar chronicles it was gripping dark and just plain fascinating to get a closer look at such a twisted character 35-4 stars i can't decide just yet 
 i decided to reread this book as i am about to continue on with the series finally 
 i did really enjoy this the second time round but found myself a little more critical of a few things i will be doing a full video review of this soon so look forward to more of my thoughts then :) really loved this book and it's story because i personally have never heard about this side of the war before and i'm so grateful i know about it now loved this book such a phenomenal retelling of snow white ** spoiler alert ** 
 remember when you were about twelve and you saw all those cool kids with scene hair writing maudlin poetry into their death note notebooks i do come on guys let's be honest here about 85% of us had an emo phase at around that time and i'm not going to mince around in my overpriced sweatpants and lie about it 
 i was such a fucking dork when i was twelve i kid you not: i tried to write a screenplay what the ever loving fuck was i thinking then i got into video games in a big way all those weird japanese nomura concoctions and then for a harrowing six-month window between twelve and thirteen i was a weeaboo raise your hand if you ever felt personally victimized by my emo bangs (put your hands down immediately you dicks) 
 that was when i hit my fanfiction stride it lasted for a while like maybe a couple of years i used to post this rambling corny horseshit all over deviantart (i was afraid of fanfictionnet) and then i came across this person who at nearly thirty years old was still writing fanfiction for magical girl anime and it was that traditional full-frontal badly-punctuated fanfiction too 
 i sat back slowly and i thought this: what if at thirty i'm still writing this dreck what if i get so wedged in this rabbit hole of bad fanfic that i never actually produce anything original or of substance well halo embodies every trap i was afraid of falling into at fourteen years old it is some of the most obnoxious insane shittily-written claptrap i have ever read in my life that one star up there unintended comedic value that's what that's for 
 the writing is abhorrently almost insultingly bad it makes me hurt to think that someone read this sentence ""it's usually pretty chill around here except things have been a bit weird lately"" and decided that there was no way the world could live without the craft of adornetto like is macmillan for real with this i just what the fuck is that 
 i feel like this book has some kind of vendetta against punctuation it's like it's making an occupy ya protest against correct grammar either that or it's a personal attack against people who give a shit about where question marks go for example: 
 there should have been a question mark at the end of this sentence: ""yes but what if they think i'm weird"" 
 but there should not have been a question mark at the end of this sentence: 
 ""i can't believe that stuff really interests you"" 
 do you see what i mean also i had to read this sentence ""a door slammed and a girl with brown curls pulled back from her face with a headband appeared"" about six times before it made any sense 
 there's also this: ""in my dress i resembled a column of shimmering moonlight"" 
 ""i resembled a column of shimmering moonlight"" 
 ""a column of shimmering moonlight"" 
 ""a column of shimmering moonlight"" 
 honest to god it's this bad it is an absolute piss-take this book honestly does have to be seen to be believed and it's bad enough that the dialogue is murderously cheesy (""you can't be"" ""an angel jackpot"" or even worse: ""holy crap"" ""would you mind not blaspheming"") but the plot is just 
 nah 
 there's nothing to say about the plot because it isn't there there is no plot to speak of it is absent non-existent there has been a mass plot exodus 
 it's kind of like the inn of the sixth happiness or paranormal activity you have to wade through an entire sinkhole of wobbly black nothingness to get to some actual substance and when you think you've finally unearthed something anything to validate the existence of this story it slips from thine desperate hands and then you're left standing there alone covered in shit wondering where your time went and your fucking money too look macmillan: if i wanted to spend my money on a turd i would buy a turd don't try and gaslight me with this 
 but the thing is that i'm not exaggerating for the first 300 or so pages bethany swoons and that's it and it's not like xavier is attractive or anything in fact he's fucking horrible horrible like mel gibson or johnny depp we're told that xavier has such a good heart and yet he shits all over bethany from the greatest height i honestly do not understand how anyone can find this controlling vindictive obsessive domineering creepy cruel misogynistic condescending chauvinistic stupid and absurd boy attractive how how someone explain to me what the allure of xavier is please 
 let's just pare it back a little and take a closer look let's put xavier under the microscope case in point: 
 ""i knew that if i wanted to keep my entire world from falling apart i would have to keep xavier"" (217) 
 ""entrusted to look after me by gabriel and ivy"" (247) 
 ""he was the one who reminded me to drink plenty of water and the one who deflected questions about my family from curious classmates he even took it upon himself to answer for me one day when mr collins asked why i hadn't managed to finish my homework by the due date"" 
 ""i knew that if it slipped my mind xavier would complete it for me and hand it in without my knowledge"" (248) 
 ""he became fiercely protective whenever anybody he didn't approve of came within a two-foot radius of me"" (248) 
 ""what's wrong with him"" i asked crossly ""he seems nice enough"" 
 ""he's not your type of person"" 
 ""why"" 
 ""you ask a lot of questions don't you"" (248) 
 ""her business is my business"" (249) 
 ""i'm not hungry gabriel always cooks a big breakfast"" 
 ""here eat this"" he commanded and pushed a health bar across the table"" (251) 
 ""xavier chuckled as he told me the story amused by the irrational antics of the females in his family"" (253) 
 if nobody can see the controlling obsessive and downright abusive nature of those quotes above then i give up i surrender i have no more fucks to give here the field in which i grow my fucks is barren all i can say is that xavier is a very frightening very twisted rape fantasy you may balk ""rape fantasy he never shows any signs of sexually assaulting bethany"" 
 rape culture runs so much deeper than bare-faced sexual assault rape culture is the ultimate snake in the grass it thrives on the encompassing control and subordination of women the propagation of gender roles (strong and dependable man weak and stupid woman) so that when a woman is raped or treated in any derivative way of rape it is shrugged off as ""just a man fulfilling his needs"" or ""she was asking for it"" or ""she's hysterical/delusional/overreacting"" or ""what a crazy bitch she should calm down"" bethany is coddled and roughed around like a toy or an accessory on xavier's arm everything they do is on xavier's terms it is what he wants when he wants it and bethany is so in awe of him that she allows him to treat her like chattel it made me feel dirty while i was reading it 
 there is something so twisted and base about the idolization of a love interest like this what exactly is wrong with society and media that we would actually endorse this behaviour and what is wrong with those people who say that the feminist movement has done her job and is out of work and that fighting for socioeconomic equality is old hat 
 who are those people are they misogynists or just blind to the fact that characters like xavier are not characters at all: they are wish fulfillment devices meaning that folk out there have been taught to wish for a submissive role in a relationship with a prince who will not only sweep them off their feet but take them home after the party cut off their landline connection and create a press frenzy it's exactly the sort of patriarchal shite that caused the disgusting culture of blame around the steubenville rape case and that plucked johnny depp off the hook after he beat the shit out of his wife all over the internet are turgid white men screaming ""amber heard wants money"" but if she fucking wanted money mate then why did she donate every penny of her divorce settlement to charity hm i wonder 
 but all of this is just window dressing for my favorite quote of the entire book: ""for this evening at least feminist philosophy had been abandoned and the girls like fairy-tale princesses let themselves be lead up the flight of steps into the foyer"" 
 i just love this i love it first of all it acts as though feminist philosophy is about two things: not wearing dresses and not touching men also feminists are against fun they're against anything traditionally feminine that's why the feminists threw me out of their club because my hair is pink and my clothes are pretty and i like platform sneakers 
 i would tackle the other characters because i haven't yet but what's the fucking point ivy barely has a pulse gabriel is just an imprint of xavier but in a creepy brotherly role rather than a sexual one and bethany is like a big piece of glittery cardboard molly is just a placeholder to praise bethany's virginity and jake is so incredibly random that i'm averse to even calling him a character what is he what exactly is going on with him he's obviously from the uk (i'm not sure where in the uk he's from because he's got a ""british accent"" which is so laughably vague but since you're making it so broad i have a headcanon that he's got that really broad glasgow accent that makes everything sound overly cheerful) because everybody there is evil right and he has this tattoo and he rides a motorbike and he's so scandalous if i had pearls i'd be clutching them (i hate pearls they creep me out i don't want hard oyster poops threaded on a string and hanging around my neck what do you take me for) 
 there's also the hilarious physical description of him his eyes are described as ""cat-green"" i may be mistaken but i'm pretty sure that cats aren't green 
 man was i wrong i must be i'm a feminist stop laughing feminists you're not allowed to have fun 
 as it nears the end the overall quality of this book really goes down the crapper at one point molly gabriel and beth are having this cozy little chat in the kitchen and when molly agonizes over her weight gabriel basically snaps his fingers in her face and says ""eat bitch"" 
 now don't get me wrong we went over this with the whole ""beach body"" debacle it was fatphobic bollocks but this book is shallower than a teaspoon; molly and gabriel talk about this hot teen issue in such a skin-crawly stilted way and i just didn't believe it i felt like i was receiving a direct lecture from the author and that doesn't cut it for me that's not enough to convince me that i don't need to diet 
 and anyway the subliminal messaging in this book just totally negates this we have this nonsense about inner beauty in the middle of a book where every single character on team good is stunningly beautiful bethany says not to invite xavier in because she looks a mess what you just gave us a lecture on the value on inner loveliness and yet you base your entire book on a relationship that places physical beauty on the highest possible bullshit pedestal having bethany chatter on and on about how hot xavier is how beautiful angels are and how she couldn't live without xavier's eyes or muscles or what have you it's this kind of absurd shallow wishy-washy bullshit that gives ya such horrible press it completely ruins it for the good books 
 to conclude this is shallow unbelievable pretentious tripe with a really fucking bleak moral background i hate bethany and xavier and jake i hate ivy too this maudlin useless doormat whose personal mission apparently consists of chaining herself to the kitchen and the church phantom and alice add nothing to the story and are just plot devices so that bethany's sickly sweet nature can win our stony hearts what a base filthy character she is i can't stand her if i met her i'd slap the shit out of her 
 there is no plot to this book a good editing job could have sliced it down to about 150 pages and even then the watery excuse for a villain and bethany's perfection would still have made me barf into my hair why did 'our father' (the fuck) send the 'agents of light' to an english-speaking upper middle class town where everybody is getting on with their lives just fine 
 how convenient no how fortunate for bethany to have arrived in a place where she can fall in 'love' with a rich white boy with a nice family and perfect health the brutal thing about this book is that it was almost a cool idea and if it had been executed better it could have been awesome for example both race and crosses in class and tradition could have been explored if a little more thought had been put into it what if bethany and her cohorts had been sent to a remote area of old-timey sub-saharan africa where bethany has to juggle both her good deeds and growing love for a male tribe member what if bethany had been entered into a war zone where she had to save the people from constant threats of violence while gradually being drawn to a young soldier on the opposing side what moral dilemma would this pose 
 it's not hard to think outside the box - or at least it shouldn't be books especially those aimed at young people have extraordinary power young minds are like sponges and if you're standing up on a podium and lighting this sort of sexist garbage fire then what are you doing with your social responsibility you're making a mockery of it today's ya does not even have to reflect the depth of 1984 or a tale of two cities; it just has to matter if it doesn't then what's the point i could learn more about the value of love and healthy body image by watching say yes to the dress and that show is also a garbage fire 
 one star for unintentional comedy and that is all it's release day so i can finally talk about my dislike for this book it's been a few months since i read it so my feelings (and outrage) are no longer super fresh but i'll do my best 
 i found this book to be sooo boring and difficult to read what with the ridiculous character names and dull plot i had tons of issues with the plot and pacing when i was reading the book and i really had to force myself to pick it up the characters were also completely one dimensional and a bore to read about so really i couldn't find anything to like about the book 
 with those issues on top of all of the problematic aspects of the story that tons of people have brought up i have no issues with giving this book 1 star please someone tell me there is a second book this one was so good but i want moreeeee like i want to know what josh's future holds i want more ** spoiler alert ** 
 yes i do get that the main character's racist perspective is obviously supposed to be an attempt to highlight the horrible views of those who raised her yes i get that this book is probably supposed to be the story of a naive sheltered girl overcoming internalized prejudice i will address all of this in a bit because it reallllly didn't work for me 
 ok so brief (ha lies nothing here will be brief) overview of the story first: 
 elloren's grandmother was the black witch who was actually horrible and killed thousands of people to ""save"" her people but elloren's been raised on the rhetoric of the oppressors she's living with her uncle in a small town because he's trying to keep her powers a secret and away from the schemes of her aunt & the council it's obvious to the reader that elloren has her grandmother's super special power but she's the definition of clueless and spends most of the book walking around wide-eyed & confused like she was born yesterday 
 their religion wants kids to get wandfasted (basically an arranged marriage) as young teens and have their racial purity tested elloren's aunt is determined to have her wandfasted to the most handsome and eligible guy ever but the uncle sends elloren to university and makes her promise not to wandfast to anyone for two years 
 the all kids go to magic school where elloren continues to spew racist nonsense the school is made up of kelts elves fae in disguise icarals with wings and a couple lupine there are characters with literally every color skin like pink lavender or green and it seems like a typical fantasy book except now everyone's reduced to their race in the most simplistic way 
 the story goes to seriously absurd lengths to put elloren in in sad situations a mean girl keeps harassing and tripping her with magic her coworkers in the kitchen physically abuse and mock her and she's assigned to live in a remote tower with a girl who tries to kill her the first night it seriously gets ridiculous the story just tries so so hard to make her the underdog and it gets beyond annoying: 
 ""i can't leave verpax universry because i'm at risk of being killed by a demonic monstrous wingless icaral and i have no alternative but to live with two demonic monstrous winged icarals and work in a place where people want to break my arms and legs"" 
 the behavior of the classmates who harass elloren is such an absurd over-the-top caricature of cruelty that it didn't even feel like girl hate anymore it just felt like bad writing it was so painful to make it through this book on so many different levels 
 the next couple hundred pages could be summed up as: everyone hates everyone else gardnerian and kelt students won't go into a classroom where a lupine student is sitting the lupine twins hate the gardnerians apparently the icaral hate the lupine and on and on i could honestly fill a review with the horrific things elloren goes around thinking and saying about everyone and she keeps calling people ""half-breeds"" even though she gets indignant at the ""slur"" when someone refers to her that way 
 i couldn't stand how the pain of others in this book almost always becomes a prop for some super basic growth and a pat on the back for elloren 
 elloren's self-centered oblivious pov is infuriating to read through because she has no common sense whatsoever and her entire petty personality can be summed up as self-pity she has such a victim complex and is one of the most irritating characters i have ever found so many of her thoughts and actions make zero sense and she reads like she's 12 instead of 17 i'm not sure if the reader is meant to hate her or not but there is truly nothing likable about her 
 elloren doesn't start really considering that the ""evil one"" stuff in her religion might be wrong until page 350 but then she still continues to be dumb it's beyond tiresome the next couple hundred pages are cringeworthy efforts for the students from different cultures to try to understand the religions and customs of other students there are six pages of ""uncomfortably blunt questions"" about lupine mating with both parties judging the other for stuff that feels iffy at best the writing is just extremely clunky juvenile and awkward to say the least 
 eventually her friend has the genius breakthrough of ""i'm finding i like meeting new people people different from me i'm tired of being afraid of everyone"" the whole thing feels like a children's book that talks down to the reader and so many of elloren's thoughts are just whyyyyy 
 the love interest spends most of the book glaring at elloren in fifty shades of anger his sole method of communication is his ""stormy eyes"" there is zero chemistry or feels there but that's the least of this book's issues it really just kept getting worse and worse as it went example: towards the end they go to rescue a selkie woman who was being abused/imprisoned by a guy as a sex slave and that entire episode is just there as a gold star for elloren it's white savior stuff all around and handled so unbelievably poorly 
 i cannot even explain how weak the meandering plot becomes by the end some cliche fantasy ideas are just scattered around without any relevance to this particular story i guess the next book will actually get into the plot about the white wand elloren's power the resistance and the whole story this entire book could be summed up as ""girl in a wide-eyed trance acts like an idiot for 600 pages"" there was seriously nothing to support or even like this book had potential too i mean the fall tournament sounded cool so did elloren's dream to be an apothecary that was mentioned on the back cover but school was mostly a vehicle for a montage of hateful scenes 
 the plot tries to deal with some very serious issues but barely carries through on anything the end is a brief poorly written mess and elloren is still just as naive and dim as ever page 547 is her first and only true apology (to a woman who works in the kitchen): ""i'm sorry i was so ignorant"" she also tells a little girl that she ""didn't want to be mean"" and that she isn't anymore and that's that folks 
 i deleted most of the example quotes that i had in here because the review got too long but they were seriously horrible and maybe some reviewers think that makes me weak for not being able to handle the ""real world"" where people are racist but i'm here to have fun that's not entertainment 
 but i don't even want to spend more time complaining about the poor execution & writing the weak and petty characters how simplistic everything was etc because it just doesn't matter when compared to the fact this was hundreds of pages of unchecked hatred and intolerance the book hit every single offensive topic in the most blatant way that it was clearly trying to show all of the possible things you could think that are wrong and the author put all of those horrible painful comments out there without really addressing it in the end 
 i couldn't handle how all of the pain in this book was thrown around cavalierly for the sake of the main character's development it's all about her struggles if this story is supposed to be about a character unlearning prejudice then we need to see something from the side of the oppressed as well they only felt like props in this girl's painfully slow growth 
 if you took all of the racism sexism ableism homophobic comments and general idiocy out of this book it would probably be 50 pages long and just the intro to a story i get that the author was trying to provide ample room for character growth here by having the character start out so ignorant i'm not misunderstanding the intent; i'm saying it really did not work for me in this case i get that this first book is setting up the rest of the series and the author wanted elloren to unlearn what she's been taught first but i don't think the way it's approached is remotely acceptable 
 the entire book turned into a narrative on racism and prejudice but felt offensively hollow because the elves lupine etc are obviously ""others"" the book needed waaaaay more worldbuilding in order to parallel racism in a way that's not so incredibly irresponsible and ignorant i thought the simplistic way that everyone hated each other (and even elloren's flimsy ""awakening"") felt like something out of a children's picture book but was placed in the context of a full fantasy world that lacked the necessary complex history and explanation of power dynamics in order to feasibly depict racism <--- that is probably my main thought sorry it took so long to get there 
 anyways it was just irritating insulting and painful to read i do not want to sit through 600 pages of an idiot mc coming to learn that ""racism is bad"" i hit the character limit in my review and can't elaborate on this but ughh we live in a world with enough hate let's have fantasy worlds where readers can see themselves instead of feeling even more alienated 
 and for the people who say ""it's just fiction relax"" (because i know i'll get comments like this) no fiction shapes how we view our world ourselves and everyone around us there is no disconnect 
 it's kind of hard to be one of the first reviewers because there's nothing to gauge your reaction against and people who were excited about the book get angry that you've ""ruined"" it i've only seen a few reviews so far from actual readers and they mostly adore this book so all i can do is share my honest reaction and then wait for any discussion to unfold 
 thank you to the publisher for sending me an arc the quotes above were taken from an arc and are subject to change upon publication wow what a ride this was a fantastic conclusion to the duology there was laughter and pain and explosions and it made for a very satisfying finale to august & kate's story 
 but we're not done with the world yet are we it's just so cool and i still have so many questions like i definitely need more books set in this world please thank you super cute and fun loved the first half but the second half felt a little all over the place overall it was lighthearted and sweet and exactly what i thought it would be 45* 
 i love leigh bardugo so much and she did such an amazing job with this story i loved how it showed the power of strong female friendships and just girl power in general my only complaint is that i felt there wasn't quite enough action for a superhero novel 
 booktalk to come i will link it when it's up 
 *thank you to chapters indigo for providing me with an arc* i was forced into watching mockingjay: part ii this weekend to clarify i watched the second part of the last hunger games movie without having read any of the books without having watched any of the movies 
 needless to say i was confused as fuck 
 so many questions and thoughts ran through my mind as i watched the movie why is peeta so thin did that huge-ass bruise really disappear from her neck the next day is katniss supposed to look like she's about to burst into tears at any given moment or is that just jennifer lawrence woody harrelson is in this movie hey it's margaery from game of thrones who's president snow what's a mockingjay lesser hemsworth is pretty hot 
 well you get the point i know how the book ended and i still have no idea who anyone is and neither do i know their names with the exception of peeta gale president snow that coin woman and katniss of course knowing how the book ended means i probably should read the first book so here i am the last person on earth to read the hunger games 
 and it was good it was really good my sister was right (she usually is) 
 what else can i say that hasn't already been said i loved it the world building was interesting (although it helps that i've seen what it looks like on the big screen) and katniss is awesome one of the things my sister didn't like about the first movie is that the on-screen katniss was different from her portrayal in the first book i haven't watched that movie but i kind of see how the screen portrayal of katniss might have bothered her book-katniss is strong kick-ass without being a mary sue she has a fierce love for her sister and she is manipulative and cunning she uses the prospect of romance to protect herself she has no qualms about using people and i love that about her 
 time to watch movie #1 final books are hard readers dive in with so many expectations hopes and fears and let's not forget the ships i suspect it must be at least a little daunting for an author to want to give their readers everything and stay true to their story friends for me marie rutkoski has done just that this story has taken me on a remarkable journey capturing my heart and and melting my emotions in one fell swoop 
 the winner's kiss is a perfect conclusion to an expertly crafted series and as always there are many familiar reasons to love the final installment as much as its predecessors while containing quite a few twists that kept me anticipating the turn of each page our protagonists kestrel and arin experience a lot of growth as previous choices finally reach shocking climatic consequences many of which i was unsure how they'd move past i definitely didn't expect the changes kestrel underwent; she is both the same and vastly different exploring physical and mental strength of female characters 
 you don't need to be gifted with a blade you are your own best weapon 
 the unpredictability of this novel is its greatest weapon as rutkoski clearly shows she's not afraid to make you beg for your favorites' survival she's heartlessly brilliant like that 
 what i didn't expect was how much i enjoyed roshar's character i give his sarcastic witty remarks an a++ and loved how he reminded me of a rougher version of sturmhond from the grisha series it was smart for him to have as much page time as he did since the winner's kiss contains romantic tension to the max with a few scenes causing me utter desperation--moments where i was throwing buckets of water out of my ship lest it sink screaming ""noooooooooo"" fiercely at my ceiling 
 i still admire the writing and how it manages to convey so much more than is actually written it's made me re-think my stance on 3rd person narration usually my least favorite but the fact that i too now feel as though i can translate kestrel and arin's epic starring contests roshar and arin's bromatic body language among a host of other tells just goes to show you the quality of writing no words are wasted and always feel so carefully deliberate while still maintaining its raw honesty 
 perhaps what the winner's kiss succeeds at the most is its ability to straddle that fine line between a character driven and plot driven novel neither side took over the other out-shining or lacking in development the relationships were given the proper amount of time and dignity not only is there a focus on kestrel and arin's but also of another that's made very clear it's just as important and maybe even more so and yes in case you were wondering this book does indeed pass the bechdel test something which i'm always pleased to see in a ya novel 
 the plot was excellent surprisingly detailed battle scenes strategies and political maneuvers are at the front without making my eyes glaze over with confusion and i loved that arin's cultural religious beliefs along side kestrel's disbelief was handled with a great amount of respect and love it really highlighted an ongoing theme of tolerance and respect of others' differences and that is so incredibly relevant and of course i really enjoyed how the novel began and ended with a winner's curse bringing the entire series full circle nice touch 
 i am fiercely in love with all things kestrel and arin their relationship struggle in the novel was so real finally a ya book where it's not the fantasy world keeping them apart but actual real relationship bumps that plagues us all: break down of communication acknowledgements of individual changes and growth trust issues accepting faults along with strengths understanding personal struggles guilt of hurting the one you love the most forgiveness and above all mutual respect 
 favorite quote: 
 ""he changed us both"" she seemed to struggle for words ""i think of you all that you lost who you were what you were forced to be and might have been and i--i have become this this person unable to--"" 
 she shut her mouth 
 ""kestrel"" he said softly ""i love this person"" 
 it's sad for me to come to the conclusion of a favorite series one that i never expected to adore so much but i loved every minute of this ride and can't wait to revisit 
 highly recommending 
 excellent series is excellent 
 an arc was provided by the publisher no monies or favors were exchanged 
 more reviews and other fantastical things at cuddlebuggery even though i just finished this book i already know it's one that will stick with me for years to come i can't fully express how cathartic this book was i finally saw parts of myself represented in a novel - the parts that i was ashamed of and pretended didn't exist this is by far my favorite john green novel i can't say much more about this because i'm still sobbing over it just read it please highkey hoping joseph falls off a cliff and we never see him again :)"
